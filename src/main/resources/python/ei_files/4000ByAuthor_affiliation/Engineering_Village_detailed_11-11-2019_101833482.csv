This study analyzed the propagation path and propagation regularity of stress waves in inclined strata, according to the fast ray-tracing technique between two points in horizontal layered media. Microseismic location algorithm was developed for inclined strata using grid searching method, which was also compared with traditional location methods based on single velocity model. The particle flow theory was exploratively used to establish the stratum numerical model. Subsequently, the validity of the proposed algorithm was verified by simulating the stress wave propagation through the interaction of particles. Results show that the traditional location algorithm, based on simplified elastic wave propagation at a constant velocity, is imprecise for inclined strata, indicating that the single velocity model cannot satisfy the locating demand for complex media., On the basis of the inclined layered velocity model and a modified computational method for stress wave propagation path, the seismic sources can be located much more accurately. Meanwhile, the location deviation was found to be proportional to the dip angle and stratum number. In addition, the location precision can be also increased by reducing the grid size in the grid searching method, suggesting that reasonable sizes and searching strategies can facilitate the application of grid searching method in practical engineering. The microseismic location method and the proposed verification process can provide important theoretical and technical support for further studies on the positioning and monitoring technology in the complex strata. © 2018, Science Press.

A large number of racemic compounds have been resolved on the coated capillary column, including derivatized amino acids, alcohols, alcohol amines, esters, ethers, ketones, and epoxides. It is interesting that the CC5-coated capillary column exhibits significant chiral recognition complementarity to a commercial β-DEX 120 column and a previously reported homochiral porous organic cage CC3-R-coated column, which could expand the range of the analytes amenable to separation on porous organic cage-based capillary columns. Moreover, the fabricated column also shows excellent selectivity for the separation of positional isomers, including the challenging ethylbenzene and xylene isomers.

To estimate the tilting parameter in the propensity score, the authors propose an adjusted empirical likelihood method to deal with the over-identified system. Under some regular conditions, the authors investigate the asymptotic properties of the proposed three estimators for distribution functions and quantiles, and find that these estimators have the same asymptotic variance.

The mean value and maximum value of the local concentration ratio of the solar flux on the receiver are more than 86.64 and 1319.43, respectively. When the tracking error and periodical adjustment error are within 1°, the ηoptof the FFFSC can reach 70.38% and 68.94%, respectively.

The Lakes Qilu and Yilong have the greatest area changes among the investigated 10 lakes. The correlation analysis between the area change of each lake and annual average precipitation, annual average evaporation, annual average temperature, vegetation-covered area, human activities of each catchment shows that: the lakes have a spatial heterogeneityresponse to regional climate change. The surface area changes of these lakes are negatively related to the local temperatures and evaporations, while positively related to the local precipitations. There is a weak correlation between the surface water body areas and vegetation-covered area.

WMS), located in the Grand Shangri-La area of south-west China, has been selected as one of the most potential regions for hosting China’s next-generation ground-based large telescopes. Firstly, Mt. WMS has ideal astronomical conditions for both day-time and night-time observations. Comprehensive analysis of remote and on-site long-term meteorological, geological and geographic data suggests that WMS satisfies the strict requirements for an excellent candidate site, through a series of key parameters including average seeing factor r0, sky brightness, clear-sky days, precipitable water vapor content (PWVC), refractive index structure constant, atmospheric coherence time, isoplanatic angle and meteorological information etc. Averagely, its daily seeing factor is over 10 cm and its night seeing factor is 0.9 arcsec on ground. The average wind speed is less than 5 m/s. The average normalized PWVC at unit air mass is about 2.5 mm. The average yearly sunshine duration is generally more than 2500 hours. The amount of yearly clear sky days and nights are respectively 250 d and 270 d. The median night sky brightness level is 21.8 mag arcsec-2. The atmosphere cleanliness is also excellent. Secondly, Mt. WMS possesses the necessary conditions for the establishment of high altitude observatories. Its ridge is flat and spreads over 2 km2. The large relative elevation difference in the local terrain, plus the existence of population settlements at low altitude (~ 2800 m) in the vicinity, substantially reduces the future cost for construction, settlement, and logistics. Its geological structure is stable, and there is virtually no record of geological disaster or inclement weather. The nearby counties have low population density (~5 km-2) and there have been extensive transportation networks. In October 2014, we initiated a long-term monitoring project in Mt. WMS. We have been collecting data from two monitoring sites for more than three years. Both sites are located about 4700~4800 m above the sea level. Our instruments mainly include the solar and stellar Differential Image Motion Monitors, the Sky Brightness Monitors, the PWVC monitors, the Atmospheric Temperature Fluctuation Monitors, the Multi-wavelength Solar Photometers and robot meterological stations, and so on. There have been a lot of activities within the ASO-G (i.e., CGST and large coronagraph) sites’ study since our last reports.1, 2 In this paper, we introduce the daily observation, transmission, storage and analysis of the harvested data, and the overall operation, management and technical support of the monitoring platforms. © 2018 SPIE","12","Information management","Atmospheric structure - Digital storage - Geology - Luminance - Observatories - Population statistics - Refractive index - Sea level - Telescopes - Time series analysis - Wind","Large telescopes - Monitoring stations - Mt.

Next, extract the mean values, standard errors, minima and maxima from the pitch frequency sequence and the first three formant frequency sequences respectively. Again, the feature sets with the mean values, standard errors, minima, maxima and label information, are inputted to IGA optimized MKSVM for analysis mode identification. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MKSVM can approximate any multivariable function. The global optimal parameter vector of MKSVM can be rapidly identified by IGA parameter optimization.

Just as other mechanical parameters of soils, the K0value is affected by many factors. The effects of the properties of test specimen and material are discussed on the basis of the test data. Strong negative correlation between the values of K0and initial dry bulk density of test specimen, one between the values of K0and median particle size diameter of test material, and one between the values of K0and gravel content by weight of test material, respectively, are observed from the test data. The mudstone particle content by weight of the mixture may also affect the value of K0. The effects of these factors on the K0value may exhibit interlocking effect.

Unfortunately, it has a problem for infrared and visible image registration. Lots of rich background detail information is usually provided by the visible light band, while the infrared image can locate an object (heat source) with a higher temperature, and often can't obtain the background information. The large difference in the background information of the two images not only interferes with the accuracy of the registration algorithm but also brings a lot of computation. In this paper, a method of fuzzy c-means clustering is used to separate foreground and background which reduces the background information interference for registration, based on the feature that the infrared image and the visible image have a high uniformity in the target area and a large difference in the background area. Then, the mutual information of the foreground image marked by clustering algorithm is calculated as the similarity measure to achieve the purpose of registration. Finally, the algorithm is tested by the infrared and visible images acquired actually.

Most previous studies have concentrated on the effects of human disturbances on species diversity, but their effects on phylogenetic diversity have been relatively seldom documented. Here, we measured the temporal changes in species and phylogenetic alpha diversity in 12 mainstream regions of the Lancang River (LCR) in the context of hydropower development and widespread exotic invasions. We found that disturbances by dams and widespread introductions of exotic fishes have induced a marked loss of native species (average 36.8 species disappeared per region, accounting for 47.2% of the historical native species) in the downstream regions over time, whereas few native species were disappeared (average 4 species disappeared, accounting for 23.8% of the historical native species) in the upstream regions. In terms of phylogenetic diversity, however, the average taxonomic distinctness (Δ+, a taxonomic proxy for phylogenetic diversity) of the entire assemblages significantly increased (an increase of 4.4% compared to historical Δ+) in all regions, while native Δ+insignificantly decreased in downstream regions, and the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Λ+, a proxy for variation in phylogenetic diversity) of the entire assemblages significantly increased (24.6%) in downstream regions, while native Λ+significantly decreased (12.0%) in all regions. Such changes in phylogenetic diversity were triggered by invasions by distantly related exotic species and disappearances of congeneric endemic species. Across the LCR, the relationships between species richness, Δ+, and Λ+and altitude all became obscure due to the combined effect of introductions and disappearances. In dammed regions, the disappearance rate and rate of change in the taxonomic distinctness of native assemblages showed negative correlations with the distances of cascade dams. Our study showed that intensive hydropower development and exotic invasions have significantly affected both the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of fish assemblages in the LCR, especially in its downstream region. However, the response of phylogenetic diversity to human disturbance was inconsistent with that of species diversity, implying that examining the response of phylogenetic diversity could provide additional information for assessing the impacts of human domination. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","79","Rivers","Biodiversity - Fading (radio) - Fish - Hydroelectric power - Hydroelectric power plants","Anthropogenic disturbance - Exotic invasion - Fish assemblages - Human disturbances - Hydro-power development - Negative correlation - Non-native species - Phylogenetic diversity","454 Environmental Engineering - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment","Number: 2016YFA0601601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FB079, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41501574, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31770460, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors wish to thank Dr. Chunlong Liu for helpful comments and suggestions on the manuscript.

The results show that though integration scheme No.1 heater has the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency at low irradiation intensity,however it is easy for collectors to collect more heat to exceed the demand as the heat amount absorbed by the feed water is small,leading to lower photoelectric conversion efficiency in high irradiation intensity. If excluding collector heat collection oversupply, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the integrated No. 2 heater is very close to integrated No. 1 heater. Therefore, simultaneous integration of No. 1 and No. 2 heaters not only has the same photoelectric conversion efficiency as that of integrated No. 1 heater when the irradiation intensity is low,but also it is not easy to have the overheating due to the large amount of heat is absorbed by the feed water.

However, few studies have been conducted on the promoting sulfidation-flotation behavior and mechanism of smithsonite. In this paper, we investigate the promoting sulfidation of smithsonite by zinc sulfide species increase with addition of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and its effect on flotation performance. The micro-flotation experiment results concluded that the addition of the ammonium chloride improved smithsonite flotation recovery by ∼17%. Zinc ion adsorption experiments and Visual MINTEQ model analysis showed that more zinc sulfide species were produced in the presence of NH4Cl. Zeta potential analysis indicated that additional sulfide ion species and isoamyl xanthate ions (IX−) from the pulp solution adhered to the smithsonite surface as NH4Cl was added, and the SEM-EDS study and the contact angle results further confirmed the positive influence of NH4Cl on the smithsonite sulfidation process. The TOF-SIMS results provided strong evidence for an increase in zinc sulfide species on the smithsonite surface and an increase in the sodium isoamyl xanthate (NaIX) molecular adsorption on the surface of sulfidized smithsonite with the addition of NH4Cl. The thickness of zinc sulfide species formed after promoting sulfidation was ∼29.20 nm, and the thickness of xanthogenate species formed was a few nanometers. The promotion in sulfidation may be due to the combined effect of the improvement of sphalerite precipitation adsorption and the ion-exchange reaction between the sulfide ions and the carbonate ions on the surface of the smithsonite. © 2018","36","Zinc sulfide","Adsorption - Chlorine compounds - Flotation - II-VI semiconductors - Ion exchange - Ions - Oxide minerals - Rare earths - Secondary ion mass spectrometry - Sulfur compounds - Zinc oxide","Ammonium chloride - Smithsonite - Sulfidation - Sulfide species - ToF SIMS","482.2 Minerals - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 51404118, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; Number: 2016T20110055, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 2017M20162228013, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51664027, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research project was supported by the financial support from the Regions of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51664027 ) and National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China (Grant No. 51404118 ) and the authors are grateful to the Analysis and Testing Centre in Kunming University of Science and Technology for its technical support ( 2016T20110055 and 2017M20162228013 ).

To improve the performance of current wide-angle infrared lenses, the design principle of zoom optical systems and the theorem of passive athermalization were utilized to develop an athermalized continuous zoom wide-angle infrared lens. The effective focal length of the proposed system was 10-24 mm(zoom ratio: 2.4: 1), the field of view(FOV) was 34°-90°, the operating wavelength was 8-12 μm, and the F number was 2.8. Considering the fact that infrared lenses were widely used in environments with large temperature variations, the proposed system was designed as a combination of six lens elements, including three fabricated with the chalcogenide glass of NBU-IR2(Ge20Sb15Se65) and three fabricated with conventional infrared materials such as germanium(Ge) and zinc sulfide (ZnS). By carefully allocating optical powers among the lens elements and properly controlling their air-spacing thicknesses, athermalization was realized by the proposed system design, in addition to the performance of continuous optical zoom. Simulation results show that the proposed system can produce thermal images with a close-to-diffraction-limit performance for the temperature range of-40 to 60. The Modulation Transfer Functions (MTFs) of the system are higher than 0.25 for the entire FOV. The system also has a compact/light-weight structure that only includes one aspheric surface on a chalcogenide glass lens element. Modern precision molding technique can be used to fabricate aspheric surfaces on chalcogenide glasses so that the fabrication costs of the proposed system can be controlled. The overall system design is suitable for the application of vehicle night vision. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Infrared and Laser Engineering.

Then, we analyzed the relationships of gas content and methane concentration vs. coal seam thickness, burial depth, coal petrology, coal quality and roof and floor lithology from the aspects of gas bearing property, coal seam distribution, coal petrology, coal quality, and lithological assemblage of coal bearing strata. Besides, we briefly discussed the main influential factors of CBM accumulation. Finally, we established a CBM area selection evaluation model based on multi-layered fuzzy mathematics and applied it to CBM favorable zone evaluation in this study area. And the following research results were obtained. First, the main factors controlling CBM accumulation are coal seam thickness, burial depth and sealing capacity of roof and floor. Second, eleven third-order evaluation parameters are selected out from the aspects of resource potential, reservoir property, storage condition and development condition as CBM exploration target evaluation indicators.

Then we studied the optimum design of EPS buffer layer thickness and the stability of the tunnel structure by using the established model. FLAC software was employed to comparatively analyse mechanics states of three kinds of structures after excavation, including the primary support, buffer layer and secondary lining of the excavated tunnel. At last, the optimum thickness of buffer layer was obtained for the certain tunnel condition. In addition, the EPS buffer layer with a thickness of 40 cm was applied in practical supporting structure between the first and the second lining. The field monitoring results showed that the actual values of lining contact pressure were less than those of standard warning, which indicated that the reliability of optimum proposal for support structures was verified. Therefore, theoretical and applied studies demonstrate that the EPS buffer layer can be an effective improvement for lining structure and a control measure for preventing potential disasters of tunnels in rich-water and swelling rock.

The structure, morphology, and surface chemical states of the obtained Ni(OH)2@Ni foam were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The chemical formation mechanism is discussed. In addition, it was found that the loading amount and morphology of the deposited Ni(OH)2depend largely on the corrosion time. Furthermore, electrodes corroded for different times were then directly used as working electrodes to investigate the areal and specific capacitances of the deposited Ni(OH)2by using cyclic voltammetry, through which a relationship between the corrosion time, loading amount, morphology, and final capacitance is built up. The electrode with the highest areal capacitance was further studied with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge−discharge processes, as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The as-prepared Ni(OH)2@Ni foam is a typical pseudocapacitance electrode. At a high current density of 5 mA cm−2, the electrode exhibits an areal capacitance of 0.863 F cm−2. For the deposited Ni(OH)2, its specific capacitance reaches 693 F g−1at a current density of 4 A g−1. After 3000 charge−discharge cycles at a current density as high as 10 A g−1(12.5 mA cm−2), the areal capacitance retains 77.3 % of its initial value.

Firstly, the numerical method is validated by considering a sinusoidal pitching semi-active flapping foil at Re = 1000 and a uniform flow over a stationary foil at Reynolds number Re = 500. Then, we consider a semi-active flapping foil with Reynolds number Re = 1000 and study the effect of sine-like and cosine-like pitching motion on the energy harvesting performance at reduced frequency f∗= 0.16. We study the pitching, with a gradual change from a sinusoid/cosinusoid to a square wave as β is increased from one. We found that increasing the value of β is ineffective to enhance energy harvesting efficiency for sine-like pitching motion, which is in agreement with the results of Deng et al. (2015) and Teng et al. (2016), however, for cosine-like pitching motion, the highest energy harvesting efficiency of 51.81% is recorded for pitching amplitude θ0= 60° and β = 2.0. Meanwhile, we observed that cosinusoidal pitching motion is more efficient for energy harvesting than sinusoidal pitching motion, and non-cosinusoidal pitching motion can enhance the harvesting efficiency compared to cosinusoidal pitching motion. In detail, we report the different performances of the sine-like and cosine-like pitching motion to study the mechanical mechanism of enhancing energy harvesting efficiency. © 2018","44","Energy harvesting","Energy efficiency - Numerical methods - Reynolds number - Turbulent flow","Flapping foil - Gradual changes - Immersed boundary methods - Mechanical mechanisms - Pitching motion - Reduced frequency - Square waves - Uniform flow","525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.5 Energy Conversion Issues - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 141120, Acronym: FYTEF, Sponsor: Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation; Number: DE160101098, Acronym: ARC, Sponsor: Australian Research Council; Number: 51479085, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11262008, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work described in this paper is funded by the research Grant from the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51479085 and 11262008 ) and the Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation (Project No. 141120 ).

A transmission digital holographic system is established to measure the phase difference of an object wave during loading. The expression to achieve the SIF from the phase difference is formulated. To enhance the accuracy of measurement, calibrated phase unwrapping based on least-squares and iteration and median filtering is applied to retrieve the actual phase from the noisy wrapped one.

The Shixiagu outcrop thereto is generally regarded as an ideal section for studying the contourites of the Darriwilian stage for its complete stratum and obvious lithological variations. Here we focus on the mechanism of limestone associations alternating with shale in the middle Kelimoli Formation based on outcrop observations, study of thin sections in labs, data from relevant geochemical tests and previous works. The results show that: the middle part of Kelimoli Formation consists of ten limestone associations which could be grouped into three cycles; the single limestone layer pinches out in shale with different forms and patterns of lens; a succession of parallel layer-homogeneous layer-parallel layer and streaky structures in the shape of gentle ripples are developed in the limestone, displaying alternating zones of lime mud and very fine crystalline under microscope. In combination of previous research, we may conclude that the mixed sequences consisting of limestone and shale in the middle Kelimoli Formation can be divided into two types, one is the mixed sequence of terrigenous clastics with carbonate, and the other is the mixed sequence of carbonate(terrigenous clastics) with diamictite, and their genetic mechanism could be attributed to the periodic overflow of contour current controlled by astronomical cycles in deep-water slope environment.

By using the equivalent circuit of the resonant grounding system, the changing rule of the post-faulty transient energy stored in the system capacitance to ground and the Petersen coil as well as the post-faulty measured transient energy of all feeders were analyzed. The measured transient energy of the healthy feeder is the energy released by the feeder's capacitance to ground, which is equal to the capacitance's transient initial energy. The measured transient energy of the faulty feeder is the energy absorbed by the transition resistance, which is equal to the sum of transient initial energy of all the healthy feeders' capacitance to the ground and the Petersen coil.

However, such these setting will lead to color images with serious noise or motion blur. Several methods have been proposed to improve a noise-color image through an invisible near infrared flash image. A novel method is that the luminance component and the chroma component of the improved color image are estimated from different image sources [1]. The luminance component is estimated mainly from the NIR image via a spectral estimation, and the chroma component is estimated from the noise-color image by denoising. However, it is challenging to estimate the luminance component. This novel method to estimate the luminance component needs to generate the learning data pairs, and the processes and algorithm are complex. It is difficult to achieve practical application. In order to reduce the complexity of the luminance estimation, an improved luminance estimation algorithm is presented in this paper, which is to weight the NIR image and the denoised-color image and the weighted coefficients are based on the mean value and standard deviation of both images. Experimental results show that the same fusion effect at aspect of color fidelity and texture quality is achieved, compared the proposed method with the novel method, however, the algorithm is more simple and practical. © 2018 SPIE.","10","Image enhancement","Color - Image denoising - Image fusion - Infrared devices - Infrared imaging - Luminance - Optical instruments - Optical signal processing - Spectrum analysis","Color imaging - Low light - Luminance component - Luminance estimation - Spectral Estimation - Standard deviation - Visible and near infrared - Weighted coefficients","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 746 Imaging Techniques - 941.3 Optical Instruments","Number: ZD2014004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61650401, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is funded by the National Science Foundation of China (grant number 61650401), the Program IRTSTYN and the Program of Yunnan Education Commission (grant number ZD2014004).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, the amount of soil erosion in the Dianchi Lake basin between 1999 and 2014 has been calculated every 3 years by applying RS and GIS techniques in combination with a soil erosion model (USLE) based on the data source of precipitation, soil, DEM and remote sensing images, for the purpose of analyzing the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of the basin's soil erosion intensity. The results indicated that: 1) The USLE model showed a high simulation accuracy for the erosion amount with the relative error was ≥18.16% and R2≥0.996; 2) The area with no apparent erosion increased from 70% in1999 to 82% in 2014, while there was a year-by-year downtrend for the soil erosion area, with the erosion area in 1999 was 776 km2and decreased to 468 km2in 2014, which showed that soil erosion in the Dianchi Basin has been effectively controlled; 3) There were remarkable characteristics for the spatial evolution trend of basin's erosion intensity: the erosion intensity in 75% or so of the basin did not change, and was spatially concentrated in the main urban area of Kunming City, the downtown of Jinning County and the area of Xinjie Town; 18.23% of the basin showed a decline in the level of erosion intensity, mainly concentrated in the streams around Dianchi lake and flowing into the lake; 8.36% of the basin showed a rise in the level of erosion intensity, mostly distributed in the mountainous terrains at the east, north and south ends of the Dianchi Basin; 4) The erosion intensity level diverting matrix showed that a relatively small change rate and a relatively high preservation rate in tiny erosion; the rate of high erosion levels shifting to low erosion levels was higher than that of low erosion levels shifting to high erosion levels, illustrated that the erosion areas were well managed with significant effects; the rate of tiny erosion and slight erosion shifting to moderate and intensive erosion was very low, lower than 0.94% in all periods, which meant that the policy of converting farmland into forests launched since 1998 obtained quite good effects. In sum, the production of series of graphs for erosion changes by integrating RS, GIS techniques and the soil erosion model can help to discover vulnerable areas for soil erosion from a spatial-temporal change perspective, which could be helpful to analyze the evolution of regional soil erosion from emergence, development to disappearance, providing the bases for making decisions for further accurate erosion prevention/control measures and as a reference for the basin's eco-environmental protection. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this paper, a truthful auction mechanism is designed for Virtual Resource Allocation and Payment (VRAP) in cloud computing. In this mechanism, users can submit multiple requests at one time, but only one request can be satisfied, known as multi requirements single mind. It is proved that the resource providers can obtain more social welfare under this mechanism than before, and it can guarantee the users' bids are truthful. The mechanism is still compatible with the traditional auction which the user can only submit one request. For the resource allocation problem, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to get the allocation result in a short time, through the reallocation strategy, the social welfare of the cloud resource provider can be maximized. The payment algorithm takes into account critical value to ensure that the machnism is truthful. In the experiment, it is analyzed in terms of social welfare, execution time, resource utilization and so on.

The Karhunen-Lo`eve transform (KLT) algorithm applied to the field of interference suppression is deduced in detail. The transform successfully passes the received signal along the basis vector in sub-band, but the interference signal along the vector is attenuated. Therefore, the problem of an optimal filter is converted into the solution of transform factor for each sub-band. Then the relationship between the KLT transform and the time domain algorithm in the interference suppression problem is given. Based on the KLT algorithm, Fourier transform (FT) that makes the correlation matrices of the received signal diagonalized approximately is applied to the interference suppression algorithm. Based on the deduction results, the final optimal filter expressions are basically the same as the KLT algorithm. Finally, the experiments are carried out by using the simulated signal and real collected data in the laboratory, respectively. The schematic diagram of the real collected device is presented. The experimental result shows that, no matter the analog signal or the real collected data, the proposed algorithm can effectively suppress the interference. For the simulation, the performance of KLT algorithm is basically same as that of FT algorithm, but KLT algorithm is obviously better than FT algorithm for real collected data. © 2018, Electromagnetics Academy.

Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (DOP) served as the main active compound in the herb. Extraction of DOP was investigated and immunmodulatory activities were evaluated. The optimal extraction process (liquid-to-material ratio of 24.6:1, extraction time of 2.1 hr, and temperature of 67.4 °C) was obtained by single-factor analysis and response surface optimization. Under this condition, DOP reached the extraction yield of 92.42%. Furthermore, DOP can promote the proliferation of splenic lymphocytes of immunodeficient mice and enhance the phagocytic capability of peritoneal macrophages. The contents of IL-6 and TNF-α in serum and splenocyte supernatants were significantly upregulated. Similarly, the contents of immune globulins (IgM and IgG) and hemolysis in serum was increased, as well as the antioxidant capabilities of thymus and serum. Therefore, this work gave an effective extraction method for DOP, and elucidated the immunmodulatory mechanisms of DOP at the level of the animal.

Numerous indicators have been employed to detect differences caused by grazing, while case studies suggest that effects differ among individual indicator systems. Across Tibetan pastures that have evolved with long grazing histories and harbour high levels of biodiversity, we tested: (1) whether commonly used grazing indicators differ in their sensitivity to grazing and environmental conditions, and (2) the relative importance of grazing and abiotic factors in controlling effects on indicators. Our sampling covered 18 sites within two main grassland types (steppe and meadow). We compared species compositions among communities of plants, small mammals and ants, as well as overall soil chemical conditions and field hyperspectral reflectance data using multivariate analyses between two qualitative levels of grazing intensity (heavy vs. light). Using univariate Generalized Linear Models, we explored the effects of grazing intensity, grassland type and their interaction on the richness and abundance of biotic groups as well as values of key soil and hyperspectral indices. The major environmental factors tested included temperature, precipitation, elevation, relief, exposure and inclination. Few of the indicators differed under relatively heavy grazing, including reductions in vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen concentration and two hyperspectral indices. Indicator groups differed both quantitatively and qualitatively with respect to grazing and climate impacts. Grazing effects were evident in the moist Kobresia meadows of eastern Tibet, while environmental controls dominated in alpine steppes of the drier western part of the plateau. Grazing effects on indicators thus depended on local precipitation conditions. Multivariate species compositions were affected by abiotic factors in all biotic indicator groups: precipitation was the most influential abiotic factor affecting plant species composition, overall soil nutrients and hyperspectral data, while elevation and temperature influenced ant and small mammal communities in terms of richness and species composition. Our results do not support the notion that local increases in relative grazing intensity have strong effects on the species richness of key biotic indicator groups across all Tibetan pastures. Reliable assessments of grazing effects thus require both multiple appropriate indicators and careful calibration to account for local climate and topographic conditions. Differences between principal grassland types must be acknowledged for future grassland conservation and management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","96","Soils","Agriculture - Biodiversity - Chemical analysis - Mammals - Multivariant analysis - Nutrients - Organic carbon - Vegetation","Ants - Field spectrometry - Small mammals - Soil carbon - Soil nutrients - Steppes - Temperate rangelands","454 Environmental Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 922 Statistical Methods","Number: -, Acronym: CAAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: XDA05130702, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","We thank the following taxonomists: I.

The nature of cloud computing requires cloud data processing systems that can handle huge volumes of data and have high performance. However, most cloud storage systems currently adopt a hash-like approach to retrieving data that only supports simple keyword-based enquiries, but lacks various forms of information search. Therefore, a scalable and efficient indexing scheme is clearly required. In this paper, we present a skip list-based cloud index, called SLC-index, which is a novel, scalable skip list-based indexing for cloud data processing. The SLC-index offers a two-layered architecture for extending indexing scope and facilitating better throughput. Dynamic load-balancing for the SLC-index is achieved by online migration of index nodes between servers. Furthermore, it is a flexible system due to its dynamic addition and removal of servers. The SLC-index is efficient for both point and range queries. Experimental results show the efficiency of the SLC-index and its usefulness as an alternative approach for cloud-suitable data structures. © 2018, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","27","Data handling","Cloud computing - Digital storage - Indexing (materials working) - Indexing (of information) - Search engines","Cloud applications - Cloud data processing - Cloud storage systems - Distributed index - Flexible system - Information search - Layered architecture - Skip listes","722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis","Number: 2017SE206, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Foundation item: Projects(61363021, 61540061, 61663047) supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Project(2017SE206) supported by the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province, China Received date: 2017−07−11; Accepted date: 2018−01−09 Corresponding author: ZHOU Wei, PhD, Professor; E-mail: zwei@ynu.edu.cn; ORCID: 0000-0002-5881-9436",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, most of MST-based methods are based on pixel operations, which require a large amount of data processing. Moreover, different fusion strategies cannot completely preserve the clear pixels within the focused area of the source image to obtain the fusion image. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method based on focus-region-level partition and pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. A clarity evaluation function is constructed to measure which regions in the source image are focused. By removing the focused regions from the source images, the non-focus regions which contain the edge pixels of the focused regions are obtained. Next, the non-focus regions are decomposed into a series of subimages using NSCT, and subimages are fused using different strategies to obtain the fused non-focus regions. Eventually, the fused result is obtained by fusing the focused regions and the fused non-focus regions. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion scheme can retain more clear pixels of two source images and preserve more details of the non-focus regions, which is superior to conventional methods in visual inspection and objective evaluations. © 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature",,"Image fusion","Data handling - Image enhancement - Neural networks - Pixels","Gaussians - Multifocus image fusion - Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms - Pulse coupled neural network - Region partition","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Moreover, on the basis of the scheduling schemes, a multivariable fuzzy controller was designed after considering the mutual influence between electric parameters. A multiplication fuzzy relationship matrix was created through weighted value which considered the influence of electric parameters to modify the fuzzy input, then a fuzzy rule base was established to logically judge the results of the defuzzification and to generate control signals. In order to optimize the charging and discharging power of energy storage system, a hybrid energy storage charge and discharge optimization method was put forward which set the minimum DC bus voltage fluctuation as the goal, with the constraints of instantaneous power balance and storage device charge or discharge limiting condition.

The possible explanations of the high butane gas-sensing characteristics of these sensors were based on the results of BET and XPS. The large surface area could provide sufficient interface between the materials and butane gas, and the adsorbed oxygen species having strong oxidation activity could break the butane molecules into CO2and H2O.

This paper presents a non-rigid point set registration method based on dual-feature Gaussian mixture model and dual-constraint transformation. Firstly, a dual-feature descriptor is defined and global feature and local feature are used to build the dual-feature descriptor. Then, Gaussian mixture model is improved to obtain a dual-feature Gaussian mixture model by the dual-feature descriptor. Finally, a local structure constraint descriptor is defined and used together with global structure constraint descriptor to preserve the local and global structures of point set. A method is presented for running estimate correspondence that uses dual-feature Gaussian mixture model and updates dual-constraint transformation based on Gaussian radial basis function iteratively to match non-rigid point set accurately. Performance of the presented method is evaluated by synthetic point set registration, CMU sequence image registration, remote sensing registration, IMM face data registration and true image feature point registration.

The smoke and heat extraction efficiencies of a transverse ventilation system were examined via a tracer gas method. Moreover, the effects of two types of hybrid smoke control modes were investigated. The first method was the longitudinal ventilation combined with point extraction method, and the second was the longitudinal ventilation combined with natural smoke exhaust. The results indicate that, if only the transverse ventilation system is adopted, both smoke and heat extraction efficiencies increase slowly with the extraction flow rate. Therefore, a high smoke extraction rate is required for the transverse ventilation system in UTLTs, and the requisite equipment may occupy large areas in the urban core districts. When the longitudinal ventilation combined with point extraction is adopted, it is difficult to prevent smoke from spreading into the upstream side of the fire using only the force of the axial flow fan; however, if the longitudinal ventilation flow is too strong, smoke would spread into the downstream branches as well. In the case of the combination of longitudinal ventilation and natural smoke exhaust shaft, the natural ventilation shaft sizes should be set appropriately. The key parameters of the two hybrid smoke control modes mentioned herein are proposed as design references. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

The combination of copper-tetraethylenepentamine (Cu-TEPA) and morpholine (MOR) as templates allowed the direct synthesis of highly active and hydrothermally stable submicron Cu-SAPO-34 catalyst for SCR of NOx with NH3 (NH3-SCR). It exhibited much better catalytic activity and hydrothermal stability than the reference catalyst synthesized with Cu-TEPA, diethylamine and tetraethylammonium bromide as templates. The origin of superior SCR performance of the submicron Cu-SAPO-34 catalyst was investigated by a series of characterization techniques including XRD, N2 sorption, NMR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, UV–vis-DRS and XPS. Consequently, the structure-performance relationship of the submicron Cu-SAPO-34 catalyst was well established. The isolated Cu2+ ions exist predominantly in submicron Cu-SAPO-34 with a plenty of Si (nOAl) (n = 1–4) structures. These Si coordination structures could generate a large number of Brønsted acid sites, which could be beneficial for NO reduction. The typical cubic crystal and isolated Cu2+ ions remain stable even after steaming at 800 °C for 12 h. Furthermore, the amount of isolated Cu2+ ions increase and copper oxides decrease and redistribute after steaming. The NH3-SCR kinetic test further proved the superior NH3-SCR performance of the submicron Cu-SAPO-34 catalyst. © 2018","44","Selective catalytic reduction","Catalyst activity - Copper oxides - Hydrothermal synthesis - Ionic liquids - Ions - Nitrogen oxides - Reduction - Silicon","Characterization techniques - Coordination structures - Direct synthesis - Hydrothermal stabilities - SAPO-34 - Selective catalytic reduction catalysts - Selective catalytic reduction of NO - Tetraethylenepentamine","451.2 Air Pollution Control - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: FSKLCCA1605, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion; ","Professor T.
