Effects of Ag-doping (x) on structures, surface morphologies, electrical and magnetic transport properties of the as-prepared LCSMO:Agxsamples were evaluated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that all samples crystallized in orthorhombic structures with Pnma space group. As x content increased, main diffraction peak (121) shifted downwards lower angles, giving rise to A site ions (Ca2+or Sr2+) substitution by Ag+. This, in turn, caused slight expansion of the lattice and improved Mn4+ion concentration. Meanwhile, grain size gradually increased and grain boundaries (GBs) reduced, the resistivity decreased and metal-insulator transition temperature (TMI) almost kept constant at room temperature. On the other hand, the magnetoresistance (MR) and temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) increased during first stages and then decreased as x further rose. An optimum doping molar ratio of x = 0.2 was obtained, with room temperature MR and TCR reaching up to 44.5% and 22.5% K−1, respectively. Curve fitting results indicated that in low temperature ferromagnetic metallic (FM) region, conductive behavior of LCSMO:Agxwas mainly related to electron-electron, electron-phonon, and electron-magnon scattering. In high temperature paramagnetic insulating (PI) region, data followed the small-polaron-hopping model. Conductive behavior in the entire temperature region was fitted with phenomenological equation under percolation approach, and found to depend on segregation of FM and PI phases. These findings suggest promising applications of LCSMO:Agxmaterials in photoelectric (uncooled bolometer or infrared detectors) or magnetic devices (uncooled magnetic sensors) at room temperature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","43","Temperature","Calcium compounds - Ceramic materials - Curve fitting - Electrons - Ferromagnetic materials - Ferromagnetism - Frequency modulation - Grain boundaries - Infrared detectors - Lanthanum compounds - Manganese oxide - Metal insulator boundaries - Metal insulator transition - Paramagnetism - Phonons - Segregation (metallography) - Semiconductor insulator boundaries - Silver oxides - Sol-gel process - Sol-gels - Solvents - Strontium compounds - X ray diffraction","Conductive behavior - Ferromagnetic metallic - La0.67(Ca0.27Sr0.06)MnO3:mol%Agx (LCSMO:Agx) - Paramagnetic insulating (PI) - Phase segregations","531.2 Metallography - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.4 Magnetic Materials - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 812.1 Ceramics - 812.3 Glass - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 944.7 Radiation Measuring Instruments","Number: 2014XT07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11674135, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 11674135 ) and the Collaborative Innovation Center of Rare and Precious Metals Advanced Materials (Grant no. 2014XT07 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The antioxidant activity was measured by four indices, namely the hydroxyl radical (·OH) scavenging effect, the superoxide anion (O2·-) scavenging effect, the DPPH radical scavenging effect, and the total reducibility. Based on the stepwise regression on Matlab, the mathematical model was established to depict the relationship between antioxidant activity, HPEF voltage, and HPEF frequency, and 3D relationship diagrams of the model were drawn to find the best HPEF parameters. It is concluded that the proper HPEF conditions can promote the extraction rate and antioxidant activity of tea polysaccharides in ripe Pu'er tea.

Therefore, this study explores the effects of electric field and temperature on the space charge characteristics of double-layered PTFE films based on the measurement of space charge distribution in double-layered PTFE films under different DC voltages and temperatures using the pulsed electro-acoustic measurement system. Results show that more charges accumulated in the PTFE sample subjected to a positive electric field during polarization and the space charges dissipated more rapidly during depolarization compared with those subjected to a negative electric field. The existence of a PTFE/PTFE interface increased the density of trap and deepened the trap. The positive charges that accumulated at the PTFE/PTFE interface during polarization gradually held a dominant position with the increase of temperature. Finally, the formation of charge in the PTFE/PTFE interface mainly depended on two factors. When the applied DC voltage was not large, the charge formation was mainly dominated by the Maxwell-Wagner polarization effect. When the voltage increased to a certain threshold, the charge formation was mainly caused by the charge injection and migration characteristics. © 1994-2012 IEEE.","24","Electric insulation","Acoustic measuring instruments - Composite films - Depolarization - Electric fields - Electric space charge - HVDC power transmission - Polarization - Polytetrafluoroethylenes - Temperature","Effects of electric fields - Interface phenomena - Maxwell-Wagner polarization effects - Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) - Polytetrafluoroethylene films - Pulsed electro acoustics - Space-charge characteristics - trapping","641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 941.1 Acoustical Instruments","Number: Xm2017197, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation; Number: 2017M622962, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFB0902702, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB251003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51707023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper is supported by the National Basic Research Program (973 Program) (2015CB251003), National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFB0902702), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51707023), China's Postdoctoral Science Fund (2017M622962) and Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation (Xm2017197).

We find that in such a device structure, the electric field strength of the incident electromagnetic (EM) field can be significantly enhanced near the edges of the grating strips. Thus, the strong coupling between the EM field and the plasmons in graphene can be achieved and the features of the plasmon-polariton oscillations in the structure can be observed. It is found that the frequencies of the plasmon-polariton modes are in the terahertz (THz) bandwidth and depend sensitively on electron density which can be tuned by applying a gate voltage. Moreover, the coupling between the cavity photons and the plasmons in graphene can be further enhanced by increasing the filling factor of the device.

We show that the new mechanism greatly promotes the evolution of cooperation even in the presence of antisocial rewarding.

It is located in the Hongliugou-Lapeiquan Au-Cu-Fe polymetallic metallogenic belt, northern Altun Mountains. Although great achievements and breakthroughs have been made in its ore exploration, studies upon its mineralization are relatively lacking, and its ore genetic mechanism is still controversial. In this paper, trace elements of the sphalerite and galena in the Kaladaban Pb-Zn deposit were studied by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), LA-ICPMS together with elemental mapping analysis. The results show that sphaleriteis are relatively rich in Fe, Mn and Cd, and depleted in In, Sn, Ga, Cr, Ge and Co, while the contents of Cu and Pb vary greatly. Among them, Fe, Mn, Cd, In, Ga and Cr are in the lattice of sphalerite in the form of isomorphism, whereas Cu and Pb may exist in the forms of isomorphism and micro-inclusions. The galena is relatively rich in Bi, Sb, Ag and Tl, depleted in Cd, Cu, Sn and Te, among which the enriched elements occur as isomorphism in galena forms. The Dazan sphalerite is dominated by reddish brown, grayish white and beige, showing that its formation temperature is medium, which is also surpported by the calculated temperatures according to the Zn, Fe, Cd, Ga and In contents and Zn/Cd, Zn/Fe and Ga/In ratios of the sphaleritein this deposit. Based on the sphalerite-galena symbiotic mineral pairs, the formation temperature range obtained was 277 ∼ 321°C with an average value of 290°C, which also shows that the Daban sulfide formation temperature is not high. Compared with the trace elements and related ratios of different genesis Pb-Zn deposits in the world, the trace element compositions of the sulfides in the Daban Pb-Zn deposit are more similar to that of the VMS deposits (such as Marketorp, Eskay Creek, Lancang Laochang, etc.). However, a large number of chalcopyrite 'disease' structures exist in the sphalerite, and the characteristics of metamorphism and deformation of the ore body are obvious. Therefore, we think that the Daban Pb-Zn deposit is dominated by the VMS type, but does not exclude the late hydrothermal effect on it to a certain extent. © 2018 Science Press.

Because CO2reduction is an uphill process with a large energy barrier, suitable catalysts are necessary to achieve this transformation. In addition, CO2adsorption on a catalyst and proton transfer to CO2are two important factors for the conversion reaction, and catalysts with high surface area and more active sites are required to improve the efficiency of CO2reduction. Here, a visible light-driven system for CO2-to-CO conversion is reported, which consists of a heterogeneous hybrid catalyst of Co and Co2P nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanolayers codoped with N and P (Co-Co2P@NPC) and a homogeneous RuII-based complex photosensitizer. The average generation rate of CO of the system was up to 35 000 μmol h−1g−1with selectivity of 79.1 % in 3 h. Linear CO production at an exceptionally high rate of 63 000 μmol h−1g−1was observed in the first hour of reaction. Inspired by this highly active catalyst, Co@NC and Co2P@NPC materials were also synthesized and their structure, morphology, and catalytic properties for CO2photoreduction were explored. The results showed that the nanoparticle size, partially adsorbed H2O molecules on the catalyst surface, and the hybrid nature of the systems influenced their photocatalytic CO2reduction performance. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This strategy was found to be more conservative than the traditional shear strength reduction method. Generally, the factor of safety defined in the limit equilibrium method should be adopted, and the most probable strength reduction path under the principle of the shortest path could be an effective approach to obtain the minimum value of the factor of safety directly.

Microstructures, electrical/magnetic transport properties, temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and magnetoresistance (MR) behaviors, were all investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that all samples crystallized in single phases without detectable secondary phases. At Sr doping (x) above 0.12, crystal structures transformed from orthorhombic phase (space group of Pnma) to rhombohedral phase (space group of R3c). As x content further rose, metal-insulator transition temperature (Tp) increased and maximum values of TCR and MR decreased. Further data revealed that TCR and MR peaks were controlled by Sr doping level x. In addition, room temperature MR and TCR of LCSMO ceramics were enhanced under oxygen assisted sintering. At Sr doping x = 0.09, the value of Tpattained room temperature (301.8 K), and the maximum values of TCR and MR reached 10.5% K−1and 43.0%, respectively.

However, the cubic perovskite (α-phase) remains stable only at high temperature and reverts to a photoinactive nonperovskite (δ-phase) CsPbI3at room temperature. In this work, the formation energies and transition energy levels of intrinsic point defects in γ- (more stable than α-phase) and δ-phases have been studied systematically by first-principles calculations. It is found that CsPbI3exhibits a unipolar self-doping behavior (p-type conductivity), which is in contrast to CH3NH3PbI3. Most of the intrinsic defects induce deeper transition energy levels in δ-phase than in γ-phase. This is due to the small Pb-I-Pb bond angles in δ-phase that results in the weak antibonding character of valence band maximum (VBM). However, the strong antibonding character of VBM plays a critical role in keeping defect tolerance in semiconductors. Therefore, these results indicate the importance of the large metal-halide-metal bond angle for the performance of perovskite solar cells. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","45","Lead compounds","Calculations - Cesium iodide - Iodine compounds - Layered semiconductors - Metal halides - Perovskite - Perovskite solar cells - Point defects - Semiconducting films - Semiconductor doping - Solar absorbers - Solar cells - Solar power generation","First-principles calculation - Formation energies - Intrinsic defects - Intrinsic point defects - P type conductivity - Solar photovoltaics - Transition energy levels - Valence-band maximums","482.2 Minerals - 615.2 Solar Power - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921 Mathematics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 2016YFB0700700, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013HA019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61366007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: BK20160299, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: 11674237, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51602211, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","W.-J.Y. acknowledges the funding support from National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant No. 2016YFB0700700, National Natural Science Foundation of China (under Grant No. 51602211 and No. 11674237), and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China (under Grant No. BK20160299).

Based on the ore-forming geological characteristics, this paper focus on the sulfur, carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the ores and surrounding rocks, and discuss the sources and evolution processes of the ore-forming materials. The Cu-Fe deposit occurs in the contact zone between the early Yanshanian Yueshan diorite and Triassic marble, with clear horizontal zonings in the skarns and ore bodies. The garnet skarn and thick massive magnetite ore body commonly occur within the external contact zone, which have clear boundaries with the surrounding rocks; whereas the diopside skarns with disseminated copper sulfide commonly occur within the internal contact zone and show gradual and transitional relations with the diorite. The δ34S values of the ores range from -6.5‰ to 10.6‰, and show a V-shaped trend from the diorite to the outer marble. This compositional variation indicates that most of the sulfur may come from magma, with involvement of some pre-Triassic clastic strata sulfur and Triassic marine sulfates in the later stage. The δ13C values of the gangue minerals range from -5.5‰ to 2.0‰, which decrease from the external contact zone to internal contact zone, indicating that the carbons of the ore-forming fluids may be mainly derived from magma, with some Triassic carbonate stratigraphic carbon involved. The marbles nearby the orebody show δ18O values lower than those of the Triassic strata, indicating that they have been remolded by the low δ18O magmatic hydrothermal fluids. The magnetite have some magma filling geological features and extremely low δ18O value, may be the result from the filling of the high temperature iron-rich fluids along the contact zone and fault. This study shows that the ore-magma filling type and hydrothermal-metasomatic type ore bodies coexist in the Anqing Fe-Cu deposit. The immiscibility between iron oxide and silicate melt occurred in magma chamber, which resulted in the formation of iron-rich fluid. The fluid migrated upward and eventually precipitated in a favorable tectonic area or contact zone, and the magnetite ore bodies were formed in the outer contact zone. By the later fluid mixing, filling metasomasis, and water-rock reaction between the differentiated hydrothermal solutions and diorite, the copper ore bodies and the copper-bearing altered diorite were formed in the internal contact zone. © 2018, Science Press.

Meanwhile, the effects of different heating rate during sulfurization on CTS morphology were investigated. Structural, morphological, compositional and phases features of the films were investigated using X-ray diffraction(XRD), scanning electron microscope(SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDS), Raman spectroscopy(Raman), respectively. Meanwhile, the optical-electrical properties of the films were characterized by UV-Vis-INR and Hall measurement system. Finally, monoclinic structure of CTS thin film with pure phase, smooth and compact surface was obtained under a condition of heating rate of 35/min during sulfurization process. Then, the current-voltage (I-V) of the solar cells was carried out under the standard test conditions(AM1.5, 100 mW/cm2, 300 K) using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The conversion efficiency of the fabricated CTS film solar cells was 1.18% with an open-circuit voltage of 299 mV, a short-circuit current density of 16.6 mA/cm2.

The ECT steady state accuracy test, the ECT harmonic characteristics and frequency aliasing test and the ECT transient characteristic test under the fault are carried out. Through the test of ECTs of different manufacturers and different principles, it is found that the measurement accuracy and stability of low power current transformer (LPCT) are better than that of all-fiber optic current transformer (FOCT) in terms of steady-state error. With the increase of frequency, the ratio error of LPCT is relatively stable, and the Rogowski coil will increase, and the phase error shows an overall increasing trend. There are varying degrees of frequency aliasing in ECT of various manufacturers. FOCT can reliably transmit transient parameters caused by fault, while LPCT is easy to saturate under DC component, and the Rogowski coil is greatly affected by integral link, which causes serious error. © 2018 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","17","Electric transformer testing","Electric currents - Electric instrument transformers - Errors - Frequency response - Manufacture - Transformer protection","Electronic current transformer - Electronic transformer - Environmental conditions - Frequency aliasing - Harmonic characteristics - Measurement accuracy - Transfer characteristics - Transient characteristic","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 704.1 Electric Components - 714 Electronic Components and Tubes","Number: 51667010, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFF0201202) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51667010).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Investigating the effect of different parameters of joints on the strength of rock mass is helpful to improve the measurement accuracy of joints and to find out the parameters that have the greatest effect on the weakening of the rock mass. Based on the equivalent rock mass technology, the influence of the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) parameters of jointed rock mass on the uniaxial compressive strength of the Representative Elementary Volume (REV) were studied in Guangshan No. 1 tunnel, Yunnan province. These parameters include mean dip angle, standard deviation of dip angle, joint size, the power of joint size distribution, and joint density. The sensitivity of these parameters on rock mass strength was also analyzed. The results show that: the strength of rock mass has the greatest sensitive to the joint mean dip angle. So it is necessary to strengthen the survey of dip angle. Increased joint density has the strongest weakening effect on rock mass strength. When the joint density increases, it is necessary to adjust the construction plan in time and improve the support strength. This study provides a reference for the key points of joint exploration and also provides a basis for rapid prediction of tunnel stability when the joint parameters change. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of CUMT.

Nine potential variables that possibly affected the extraction yields – the liquid-solid ratio, incubation temperature, incubation time, amount of enzyme, homogenate time, ultrasound irradiation power, mark-space ratio of ultrasound irradiation, rate of agitation, and pH – were investigated using a Plackett–Burman design in order to screen out the significant variables. The liquid-solid ratio, incubation temperature, and incubation time were significant on a statistical basis and these three parameters were studied through a Box–Behnken design for the prediction of the best experimental conditions that maximize extraction yield of the fruit oil. A maximum fruit oil recovery of 79.36% with an error of 0.17% was achieved under the optimal extracting conditions: liquid-solid ratio of 7.13, the incubation time of 2.94 h, and the incubation temperature of 48.74 °C.

According to the calculated results, the electronic structure and optical properties of Cu2Q and CuQ present certain similarities and tendencies, with the increase of atomic number of Q elements: the interactions between Cu-Q, Cu-Cu, and Q-Q are gradually enhancing; the value of band gap is gradually decreasing, due to the down-shifting of Cu-4p states; the covalent feature of Cu atoms is gradually strengthening, while their ionic feature is gradually weakening; the absorption coefficient in the visible-light region is also increasing. On the other hand, some differences can be found, owing to the different crystal structure and component, for example: CuO presents the characteristics of multi-band gap, which is very favorable to absorb infrared-light; the electron transfer in CuQ is stronger than that in Cu2Q; the absorption peaks and intensity are very strong in the ultraviolet-light region and infrared-light region.

Bacterial biofilm formation facilitates CF development and restricts the anti-bacterial potential of many current antibiotics. The capacity of P. aeruginosa to form biofilms and resist antibiotics is closely correlated with quorum sensing (QS). Disrupting QS by QS inhibitors is a promising strategy for treating chronic infections. Here, we evaluated the effect of hordenine, a recently characterized QS inhibitor, on the susceptibility of aminoglycoside antibiotics against P. aeruginosa biofilms. Hordenine significantly enhanced the susceptibility of aminoglycoside antibiotics tobramycin, gentamycin, and amikacin against P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm formation. Combinations of hordenine and aminoglycoside antibiotics showed potent efficiency in disrupting the preformed biofilms of P. aeruginosa. Microscopic observations showed flat, scattered, and unstructured biofilm architecture after treatment with hordenine. Mechanistic study further revealed that hordenine treatment led to the downregulation of genes involved in QS and biofilm formation. Thus, our results suggest that hordenine has the potential to function as an antibiotic accelerant in treating P. aeruginosa infections. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","37","Biofilms","Antibiotics - Bacteria - Magnetic susceptibility","Aminoglycoside antibiotics - Bacterial biofilm - Biofilm architecture - Combinatorial studies - Mechanistic studies - Microscopic observations - Pseudomonas aeruginosa - Quorum-sensing",,"Number: 2017YFD0201401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 201608052, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Nanjing University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province; Number: BK20170859, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: 41766006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 30916011307, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","Funding This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFD0201401); National Natural Science Foundation of China (41766006); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (BK20170859); Science and Technology Development Program of Modern Agriculture, Nanjing (201608052); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province; and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (30916011307).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The existing approaches for site selection (commonly used by economists) are manual, subjective and not scalable. This paper presents a data-driven situation-specific site selection approach (called D3SA for short) for users who are eager to create a business (hotel, hot-pot restaurant, etc.). Given a business and some related parameters, it recommends suggested sites that can satisfy users' requirements. Unlike existing works, we consider using prevalent co-location patterns discovered from spatial data sets to select the sites. Meanwhile, a novel co-location generation algorithm is pro-posed to discover co-location patterns efficiently. Furthermore, ontologies are used in order to classify the whole spatial data according to the semantic of businesses to assist to find the 'best' co-location pattern. The experimental results evaluated based on both a real POI (Points of Interests) dataset in Beijing and ex-tended synthetic data sets show the effectiveness and efficiency of D3SA. © 2018 IEEE.","20","Site selection","Big data - Cloud computing - Data mining - Economics - Location - Ontology - Semantics - Ubiquitous computing","Co-location patterns - Effectiveness and efficiencies - Generation algorithm - Points of interest - Spatial data - Spatial data mining - Spatial datasets - Synthetic datasets","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 971 Social Sciences","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","* Corresponding author.

Ore bodies in the Luziyuan deposit occurred as stratiform-like, veined and lenticular in the interlayer fracture zone of skarn and marble in the Late Cambrian carbonate formation. The ores are mainly characterized by banded, disseminated and veined-stockwork structures. The wallrocks are marked by intense hydrothermal alteration with a complexed and prominent zonation pattern in the sequence from bottom to top: garnet-diopside-tremolite-actinolite to chlorite-epidote-actinolite-rhodonite, and to carbonate-marbleization. The ore-forming fluids have undergone a significant evolution from early to late stages. The present paper concentrates on a systematic study of fluid inclusions involving various gangue minerals and sphalerite from the early and late skarn stages, quartz-sulfide mineral and quartz-carbonate stages. CO2-bearing liquid-rich fluid inclusions and liquid inclusions are common in the early skarn stage. These inclusions contain a large amount of K+, Na+, Ca+, F-, Cl-, and a little SO2-4 in the liquid phase, and H2O- and CO2-dominant and a small amount of CH4 and N2 in the vapor phase. Their homogenization temperatures range from 233. 6 to 315. 6°C and salinities from 10. 6% to 17. 6% NaCleqv. The late skarn stage is characterized by CO2-rich and NaCl-bearing fluid inclusions, with homogenization temperature ranging from 214.9 to 388. o°C and salinity from 5. 9% to 16.4% NaCleqv. The quartz-sulfide stage is dominated by CO2-bearing fluid inclusions, whose vapor phase mainly consists of H2O, CH4, and a small amount of CO2. The homogenization temperature ranges from 150. 0 to 285. 0°C and salinity from 2. 5% to 13. 8% NaCleqv. In the quartz-carbonate stage the inclusion fluid with a single composition has homogenization temperatures of 105. 0 ∼ 187. 5°C and salinity of 0. 5% to 12. 3% NaCleqv. Fluid inclusion characteristics combined with the H-0 isotope results suggest that the Luziyuan ore-forming fluid is sourced from deep magmatic hydrothermal solution with medium-high temperature and salinity, high K and Na contents, and rich in CO2, Cl, F in the early stage, but in the quartz-sulfide stage, is characterized by medium-low temperature, low salinity, and poor in CO2 due to being mixed with meteoric water that becomes dominant in the late stage. Therefore, the change in ore-forming environment, mixing of different fluids and possible fluid boiling may be the important mechanisms for precipitation and enrichment of metallic elements in the Luziyuan deposit. In the light of ore geology, fluid inclusions and H-0 isotopes, we propose that the Luziyuan Pb-Zn-Fe (-Cu) poly-metallic deposit is a distal skarn type mineralization system which is related to the deep-hidden granite and the continental collision orogeny. © Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica.

The results reveal the o-carborane species to be energetically hedged into a four-step path (barrier heights 5.3, 19.7, 18.4 and 0.3 kcal mol-1, respectively) prior to being transferred into the active Ni-carboryne species (COM1) with the assistance ofnBuLi and NiCl2(PPh3)2at room temperature. In direct agreement with empirical trends, alkene insertion into Ni-C bonds on COM1 is exclusively favoured over the competing alkyne insertion. Electronic structure analyses of the corresponding transition structures showed that the preference of alkenes to alkynes is due to different bonding characteristics during this insertion process, namely, back donation for alkenes but donation for alkyne insertion, as evidenced by molecular graphics and NBO charge distributions. Subsequent alkyne additions (i.e. post alkene insertion) arise as the rate-determining step (RDS) for each of the five different reactions (a-e) explored.

The shape-evolution of ZnO from mesocrystal to nanocrystal was achieved by increasing the amount of water in the reaction system under otherwise the same conditions, which can be attributed to selective-capping and preferential growth mechanisms based on DFT calculations. Typically, nanoparticle-aggregated cone-like ZnO mesocrystals enclosed by curved (1011) and flat (0001) surfaces were prepared in a lower amount of water, while various ZnO crystals without curved (1011) surfaces were synthesized in a higher amount of water. In particular, 'surface heterojunctions' were constructed in cone-like ZnO mesocrystals with co-exposed curved (1011) and flat (0001) surfaces, and these displayed greater photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dye compared to the ZnO nanocrystals. This investigation is of great significance to the synthesis of additive-free ZnO mesocrystals, and offers a good opportunity to understand the formation mechanism and fundamental significance of the preferential growth of ZnO mesocrystals.

GO grafted with poly (L-lactic acid) molecular chains (GO-g-PLLA) was prepared. Lactic acid O-carboxyanhydride has a higher polymerization activity under mild polymerization conditions. Thus, the functionalization of the polymer chains and obtaining poly (lactic acid) (PLLA) was easily achieved by ring-opening polymerization with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the catalyst. The results showed that with this method, PLLA can be rapidly grafted to the surface of GO in one step. As a result, the chemical structure of the GO surface was altered, improving its dispersion in organic solvents and in a PLLA matrix, as well as its bonding strength with the PLLA interface. We then prepared GO/PLLA and PLLA/GO-g-PLLA composite materials and investigated the differences in their interfacial properties and mechanical properties. GO-g-PLLA exhibited excellent dispersion in the PLLA matrix and formed excellent interfacial bonds with PLLA through mechanical interlocking, demonstrating a significant enhancement effect compared to PLLA.

The preparation of hydrochar of MSs for the purpose of energy has broad prospects. This study investigated the possible optimum conditions for the most appropriate yield and higher heating value (HHV) of hydrochar through hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) of MSs. The yield and HHV via HTC were systematically analysed by response surface methodology (RSM) using a synthetic weighted scoring method. The operating parameters included reaction temperature, reaction time, and water-to-biomass ratio. According to the mathematical model of RSM, the maximum response value was obtained under the following optimum conditions: reaction temperature, 220 °C; reaction time, 60 min; and water-to-biomass ratio, 11. The results showed that the reaction temperature exerted more remarkable influence than time and water-to-biomass ratio. Under the optimal conditions, the hydrochar yield and HHV were 57.58% and 22.69 MJ/kg, respectively. The results of elemental, proximate, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses showed that the hydrochar fuel properties improved compared with those of raw MSs.

This paper employs visual interpretation, overlay analysis, pollution footprint model and principal component analysis to analyze water quality changes as well as the pollution footprint and humanities driving force of the pollutants in the lake and rivers based on water quality data, statistical data on the society and economy, as well as remote sensing images. The results show that the water quality at Lake Xingyun is best in March and worst in September. During the period from 2005 to 2015, the water quality was best in 2008 but worst in 2014. From 2008 to 2014, the water quality got worsening and then reversed since 2015. In 2015, the pollution footprint of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution occupied 583.26, 705.88 and 494.11 km2, respectively. The top four rivers with the most pollution footprint for the pollutants in the lake and river are listed as Dajie River, Eastern River, Yucun River and Western River, accounted for 66.21% of the total pollution footprint in Lake Xingyun. The land use in the four rivers with the highest degree of pollution can be classified as the paddy field, dry land or village. The first principal component (total population, planting area, rural population, fertilizer use amount, plastic sheeting use amount, large livestock stock amount) influencing the water quality of Lake Xingyun is related to the rural life and agricultural pollution. The second principal component (per capita GDP, firstly industry output value, secondary industry output value, tertiary industry output value) is connected with the social and economic development. Hence, the humanities driving force for water quality changes in Lake Xingyun can be classified as the rural life and agricultural pollution or social and economic development. The first principal component has a contribution rate of 84.389%, which means that it is the major driving force for water quality changes. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","39","River pollution","Agriculture - Economic and social effects - Eutrophication - Lake pollution - Lakes - Land use - Principal component analysis - Quality control - Remote sensing - Rivers - Rural areas - Water quality","Agricultural pollution - First principal components - Footprint - Inflow - Nitrogen and phosphorus - Non-point source pollution - Social and economic development - Social economic factors","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 445.2 Water Analysis - 453 Water Pollution - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 971 Social Sciences",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

First, the buffering effect of an acidic solution was demonstrated, which provides relatively long and stable cell discharge behaviors. Second, the catholytes of hybrid sodium-air cells were optimized systematically from the solutions of 0.1 M H3PO4 + 0.1 M Na2SO4 to 0.1 M HAc + 0.1 M NaAc and it was found that the cells with 0.1 M H3PO4 + 0.1 M Na2SO4 displayed a maximum power density of 34.9 mW cm-2. The cell with 0.1 M H3PO4 + 0.1 M Na2SO4 displayed higher discharge capacity of 896 mAh g-1. Moreover, the fabricated acidic hybrid sodium-air cells exhibited stable cycling performance in ambient air and they delivered a low voltage gap around 0.3 V when the current density is 0.13 mA cm-2, leading to a high energy efficiency up to 90%.

The Ge-Ge peak of Ge QDs obtained by Raman spectroscopy initially undergoes a blue shift and then a red shift with increasing annealing temperature.

SAEW had a stronger bacteriostasis effect than the antibiotics used. SAEW can inhibit the ability to reproduce, causing abnormal cell morphology and cell elongation. The cell volume was increased with a change in the membrane permeability. The cell nuclear morphology was changed, further inducing apoptosis.

In particular, the missing probability is assumed to be affected by norm-bounded uncertainties. Moreover, the proposed filter design is more general and realistic since it unifies the mode-independent and mode-dependent characteristics in a single framework. By using Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability theory and Abel lemma, a new set of sufficient conditions is established which ensures the stochastic admissibility of the resulting error system with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level. Based on the sufficient conditions, the explicit expression of the desired filter gain matrices is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed non-fragile filter design, wherein it is showed that the proposed method yields less conservative results over some existing methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","41","Closed loop systems","Linear matrix inequalities - Markov processes - Numerical methods - Robustness (control systems) - Stochastic systems - Time delay - Time varying control systems","Dependent characteristics - Markovian jump systems - Missing measurements - Missing probability - Non-fragile - Norm-bounded uncertainty - Prescribed disturbance attenuation - Time varying- delays","713 Electronic Circuits - 731.1 Control Systems - 921.1 Algebra - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

So simultaneous removing of three gases is necessary. HCN can be converted into NH3, and COS/CS2 can be converted into H2S during the catalysis hydrolysis process. NH3 and H2S can be catalytic oxidized to N2 and S respectively, and S can be recycled. The development of catalysts for the simultaneous catalytic hydrolysis of HCN, COS and CS2 and oxidation of NH3 and H2S in one step is the key problem of this technology.

The influences of powder recycling times on hardness and impact toughness of the sintered samples are systematically investigated with the help of EOS P110 system and EOS PA2200 powders.

By employing the distance reject option in the EKNN rule, only normal operating data is needed to construct the early warning model. An adaptive discounting factor is adopted to make the early warning boundary adaptive to local distribution characteristics of the training samples, so as to improve both effectiveness and robustness of CMEW-EKNN.

The risk assessment model of tunnel’s construction based on the efficacy coefficient method was established. Then the model is applied to the Diantou tunnel of Dali-Yongsheng highway in Yunnan Province. The results show that the construction risk of the left tunnel is extremely high and the warning level is serious warning. By comparison, the risk grade of the right tunnel construction is relatively lower and the warning level is moderate warning. The existing construction measures cannot meet the safety requirements for the crossing section and need to be adjusted in time. Through comprehensive analysis, some measures such as closing partial lane, reinforcing working face, strengthening the primary support, adjusting the advanced support plan, closing primary support in time and speeding up the construction of second lining, are used in construction. These measures avoid the occurrence of tunnel disasters, and ensure the safety and success of the tunnel’s construction. © Conference Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Project Management, ISPM 2018.

In the experiments, sets of samples satisfying the HK distribution are generated, and then the parameters are estimated by the proposed CAPSO-based MLE method.

Results showed that the removal of sulfamethoxazole was effective in Fc-catalyzed photo-Fenton system. Electron spin resonance and radical scavenging experiments verified that there was a photoindued electron transfer process from Fc to H2O2 and dissolved oxygen resulting in the formation of [rad]OH that was primarily responsible for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole. The reactions of [rad]OH with substructure model compounds of sulfamethoxazole unveiled that aniline moiety was the preferable reaction site of sulfamethoxazole, which was verified by the formation of hydroxylated product and the dimer of sulfamethoxazole in Fc-catalyzed photo-Fenton system. This heterogeneous photo-Fenton system displayed an effective degradation efficiency even in a complex water matrices, and Fc represented a long-term stability by using the catalyst for multiple cycles.

Hard X-ray (HXR) sources are frequently observed near the top of solar flare loops, which are also bright in soft X-ray (SXR) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavebands. We revisit a recent scenario proposed by Fang et al. (2016) to trigger loop-top turbulence in flaring loops, which can help explain variations seen in SXR and EUV brightenings and potentially impact and induce HXR emission. It is conjectured that evaporation flows from flare-impacted chromospheric footpoints interact with each other near the loop top and produce turbulence via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Aims. By performing a rigorous parameter survey, in which we vary the duration, total amount, and asymmetry of the energy deposition at both footpoints, we assess the relevance of the KHI in triggering and sustaining loop-top turbulence. We synthesize SXR and EUV emission and discuss the possibility of HXR emission through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton processes, which scatter SXR photons to HXR photons via the inverse Compton mechanism. Methods. We performed 2.5D numerical simulations in which the magnetohydrodynamic model incorporates a realistic photosphere to coronal stratification, parametrized heating, radiative losses, and field-aligned anisotropic thermal conduction. We focus on the trigger of the KHI and the resulting turbulence, as well as identify various oscillatory patterns that appear in the evolutions. Results. We find that a M2.2-class related amount of energy should be deposited in less than four minutes to trigger a KHI interaction. Slower deposition, or lesser energy (29 ergs) rather leads to mere loop-top compression sites bounded by shocks, without KHI development. Asymmetry in the footpoint deposition determines whether the KHI turbulent zone gets produced away from the apex, and asymmetric cases can show a slow-mode mediated, periodic displacement of the turbulent zone. Our reference simulation further demonstrates a clear 25 s periodicity in the declining phase of the SXR light curve, wherein compressional effects dominate. Conclusions. When turbulence is produced in the loop apex, an index of -5/3 can be found in the spectra of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Typical values for M-class flares routinely show KHI development. The synthesized SXR light curve shows a clear periodic signal related to the sloshing motion of the vortex pattern created by the KHI. © ESO 2018.","44","X rays","Chromophores - Deposition - Extreme ultraviolet lithography - Gamma rays - Inverse problems - Light - Magnetohydrodynamics - Photons - Surveys - Turbulence","Compressional effects - Kelvin-helmholtz instabilities - Magnetic field fluctuations - Magnetohydrodynamic model - Oscillatory patterns - Sun : corona - Sun: flares - Sun: X-rays , gamma rays","615.3 Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) Power Generation - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 932.1 High Energy Physics","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: KU Leuven; Number: GOA/2015-014, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; ","Acknowledgements.

The effects of etching time, beam current, and voltage on the size reduction of PS particles were well investigated. A slow etching rate, about 9.2 nm/min, is obtained for the nanospheres with the diameter of 100 nm. The rate does not maintain constant with increasing the etching time. This may result from the thermal energy accumulated gradually in a long-time bombardment of ion beam. The etching rate increases nonlinearly with the increase of beam current, while it increases firstly then reach its saturation with the increase of beam voltage.

This paper investigates the optimal treatment timing and technique for replacing the deformed primary lining. For this purpose, a two-stage numerical approach is employed for a severe tunnel collapse accident occurring on the Jinhong Highway. In the first stage, a global tunnel model is constructed using the finite difference method (FDM). The parameters are calibrated by the synthetic rock mass (SRM) approach, laboratory testing and field data. The continuously yielding (CY) joint model is used in the SRM, and its parameters are derived by the joint direct shear test. In the second stage, a local model encompassing the discrete fracture network (DFN) is constructed using the discrete element method (DEM) in the collapsed zone. Based on the DEM, the influence of the primary lining rehabilitation on the failure of the rock masses is analyzed. The local model is used to study the optimal rehabilitation timing, the optimum rehabilitation duration and the reasonable length of each replacement cycle. The following three conclusions are drawn. (1) The optimal rehabilitation timing is when the deformation of the rock masses reaches 90% of the total deformation. (2) There is a time threshold for the duration of the rehabilitation; if the duration is less than this value, the impact on the surrounding rock is small and almost the same. However, if the duration exceeds this value, the damage to the rock mass will increase as the duration increases. (3) The reasonable length of every replacement cycle should be less than the steel support spacing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","35","Rocks","Deformation - Finite difference method - Frequency division multiplexing - Joint prostheses - Linings - Rock mechanics","DEM-DFN - Discrete fracture network - Finitedifference methods (FDM) - Numerical approaches - Optimal rehabilitation - Synthetic rock mass - Treatment techniques - Treatment timing",,"Number: Z151100000315014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Outstanding Talent Training Foundation; Number: 51674015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The financial supports from the Beijing Training Project for the Leading Talent in S & T (Z151100000315014) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51674015) are gratefully acknowledged.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The key problem of multi-focus image fusion is how to determine the focused regions of the source images. As an effective and excellent fusion algorithm, the focused regions in the source images should be preserved as much as possible into the fused image. To accomplish this goal, a novel multi-focus image fusion method based on a focused regions boundary finding and multi-scale transform (MST) is proposed in this paper. The Meanshift algorithm is used to determine the focused regions first. Then, an edge detection method and morphological method are used to find the boundaries of the focused regions in the source images. For the focused boundary regions, the combination of pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) and Gaussian fuzzy method is used to produce the fused boundary region in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. Finally, the fused boundary region and the focused region of the source images are fused directly. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accurately determine the focused regions, and at the same time, a better fused boundary region can be obtained; this algorithm is superior to conventional methods with respect to both objective quality evaluations and visual inspection. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","53","Image fusion","Edge detection - Neural networks","Edge detection methods - Mean shift - Mean shift algorithm - Morphological processing - Multi-scale transforms - Multifocus image fusion - Non subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) - Pulse coupled neural network",,"Number: 2017M621586, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 61365001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their careful works and valuable suggestions for this study.

Some recent researches have been trying to solve this problem, but they failed to achieve high security. This paper proposes an image encryption algorithm based on CNN (Cellular Neural Networks) hyper chaotic system, and the image encryption key is encrypted by using the asymmetric RSA algorithm. Our algorithm uses the key as input through the CNN system to generate six dimensional chaotic sequences. Then we change the original image pixel positions by pair-wise sorting the pixels with the values of the chaotic sequences. Finally replace the pixel values by performing XOR operation between the pixel values and the sequences to get the cipher image. The simulation experiments show that, compared with other chaotic image encryption schemes, it can resist the transmission noise. Moreover, it can also decrypt the image even after some part of the cipher image had been lost. The cipher image can also achieve high change rate of pixel ratio, high information entropy, and strong anti-hacking ability. © 2018 IEEE.","20","Cryptography","Cellular neural networks - Chaotic systems - Personal computing - Pixels","Hyper-chaotic systems - Image encryption algorithm - Image encryption scheme - Image encryptions - Information entropy - Recent researches - RSA algorithms - Transmission noise","723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 723.5 Computer Applications - 961 Systems Science","Number: 111802, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015Y286, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science Research Foundation of Yunnan Education Bureau; Number: 31400493, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 31400493), also supported by the Scientific research Foundation of Yunnan Provincial Education Bureau of China (grant number 2015Y286) and The Doctoral Research Foundation of Southwest Forestry University(grant number 111802).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The descriptive statistics of the household roles and their corresponding travel mode choice are presented using the data from Kunming, China. The statistical results show that the modal splits between females and males perform a significant difference in the same household roles. Furthermore, the travel mode choice of females and males are estimated separately using multinomial logistic regression model. The results show that those who face more space-time constraints associated with household tasks are less willing to travel by car. While with the increase of commuting constraints, household heads, especially female-heads, tend to use car to meet the travel demands of household activity. Besides, individuals’ age, education level, the number of cars and bikes in household also have a significant impact on travel mode choices of individuals. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","34","Decision making","Regression analysis","gender - household roles - Intra-household interaction - Space-Time constraints - Travel mode choices",,"Number: 51561135003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The financial support from the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.51561135003), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.51338003), and the Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51668029) is gratefully acknowledged.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In our method, we used the Retinex image enhance algorithm to protrude the edge contour and contrast, highlight the detailed features, and enhance the overall visibility of infrared images. In particular, the LeNet5 convolution neural network and CVC vehicle-assisted driving database were used to train the interesting target in the infrared image to generate the target data model, and the selective search algorithm was used to segment the candidate detect object regions in the image. The separated candidate regions were sent to the trained data model to classify the type and locate the position of objects in the image.

Plant functional traits and their diversity are key determinants of ecosystem function in changing environments. Understanding the successional dynamics of functional features in forest ecosystems is a first step to their sustainable management. In this study, we tested the changes in functional community composition with succession in tropical monsoon forests in Xishuangbanna, China. We sampled 33 plots at three successional stages-~40-year-old secondary forests, ~60-year-old secondary forests, and old growth forests-following the abandonment of the shifting cultivation land. Community-level functional traits were calculated based on measurements of nine functional traits for 135 woody plant species. The results show that the community structures and species composition of the old-growth forests were significantly different to those of the secondary stands. The species diversity, including species richness (S), the Shannon-Weaver index (H), and Pielou's evenness (J), significantly increased during the recovery process after shifting cultivation. The seven studied leaf functional traits (deciduousness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorus content, leaf potassium content and leaf carbon content) changed from conservative to acquisitive syndromes during the recovery process, whereas wood density showed the opposite pattern, and seed mass showed no significant change, suggesting that leaf traits are more sensitive to environmental changes than wood or seed traits. The functional richness increased during the recovery process, whereas the functional evenness and divergence had the highest values in the 60-year-old secondary communities. Soil nutrients significantly influenced functional traits, but their effects on functional diversity were less obvious during the secondary succession after shifting cultivation. Our study indicates that the recovery of tropical monsoon forests is rather slow; secondary stands recover far less than the old growth stands in terms of community structure and species and functional diversity, even after about half a century of recovery, highlighting the importance of the conservation of old growth tropical monsoon forest ecosystems. © 2018 by the authors.","89","Forestry","Atmospheric thermodynamics - Biodiversity - Conservation - Ecosystems - Hardwoods - Plants (botany) - Recovery - Secondary recovery - Sustainable development - Tropics","Environmental filers - Functional diversity - Leaf traits - Secondary succession - Seed mass - Tropical monsoon - Wood density","443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 511.1 Oil Field Production Operations","Number: 31100391, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31460112, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We were very grateful to Kingsly Bengd and Kycle W.

To account for the practitioner-to-practitioner variability, the expected average run length (ARL) and the standard deviation of the average run length (SDARL) is used as the performance metrics. Our results show that the estimation error results in the significant variation in the ARL distribution. Furthermore, in order to adequately reduce the variability, more phase I samples are required in terms of the SDARL metric than that in terms of the expected ARL metric. In addition, more observations on each sampled profile are suggested to improve the charts' performance, especially for small phase I sample sizes. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the performance of the proposed zone control charts. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","35","Statistical process control","Control charts - Flowcharting - Graphic methods - Parameter estimation","Average run lengths - Estimated parameter - Estimation errors - Performance metrics - Profile monitoring - SDARL - Standard deviation - Statistical process controls (SPC)",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 71202087, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 71401123, 71672122, and 71202087).

A polynomial fitting technology is used to deal with nonlinear functions involving at least two variables of water level, storage, discharge, and generation in the MINLP. The order and formulation of each function are analyzed and determined. Two fourth-order polynomial formulations are developed to express the fore-bay and tailrace water levels in terms of storage volume and total outflow of the reservoir, respectively. Considering the effect of water head on power generation, a quadratic function of water head and turbine discharge is proposed to accurately describe the power generation of the unit. Thus, a three-dimensional surface which can represent the relationship among water head, discharge, and generation is obtained, which can satisfy the requirement of calculating power generation under different net heads. Finally, the MINLP model is worked out by a mathematical solver and verified by solving the actual load distribution problem of Xiluodu hydropower plant with 18 generating units. A comparison between MINLP model and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is presented in terms of application complexity and result accuracy. The results show that the MINLP model is easy to use and capable of producing higher-accuracy optimization results. Furthermore, the error of total turbine water consumption through the actual curve reverse interpolation is 91% less than that from MILP, better representing the actual unit operation. © 2018 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","25","Integer programming","Electric load dispatching - Electric power plant loads - Hydroelectric power - Hydroelectric power plants - Nonlinear programming - Polynomials - Reservoirs (water) - Turbines - Water levels","Hydropower dispatch - Load distributions - Mixed-integer nonlinear programming - Polynomial fittings - Unit-commitment","441.2 Reservoirs - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 921.1 Algebra - 921.5 Optimization Techniques","Number: 51579029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51579029) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. DUT16QY30).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

MoS2/AuNCs nanocomposite was used for a platform for immobilizing more antibody due to its large surface area and excellent biocompatibility. This enzyme-free immunosensor is coupled with a robust immunosandwich format employing Au@PtNPs-labeled antibody as a non-enzymatic reporter. Due to high catalytic efficiency and good stability of Au@PtNPs, Au@PtNPs-immobilized antibody competed for target antigen to form an antibody-antigen immunocomplex and further amplified the electrochemical signal. Thus, the concentration of the MC-LR is directly proportional to the electrochemical signal of immunosensor. Under optimized conditions, the proposed enzyme-free immunosensor was employed to detect MC-LR and exhibited a wide linear range of 1.0 ng L−1–1.0 mg L−1 with low detection limit of 0.3 ng L−1 (S/N = 3).

Nematodetrapping fungi can switch their lifestyle from saprophytic to pathogenic by developing specific trapping devices induced by nematodes to infect their prey as a response to nutrient depletion in nature. However, the chemical identity of the specific fungal metabolites used during the switch remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that these important signal molecules might be volatile in nature. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to carry out comparative analysis of fungal metabolomics during the saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles of the model species Arthrobotrys oligospora. Two media commonly used in research on this species, cornmeal agar (CMA) and potato dextrose agar (PDA), were chosen for use in this study. The fungus produced a small group of volatile furanone and pyrone metabolites that were associated with the switch from the saprophytic to the pathogenic stage. A. oligospora fungi grown on CMA tended to produce more traps and employ attractive furanones to improve the utilization of traps, while fungi grown on PDA developed fewer traps and used nematodetoxic furanone metabolites to compensate for insufficient traps. Another volatile pyrone metabolite, maltol, was identified as a morphological regulator for enhancing trap formation. Deletion of the gene AOL_s00079g496 in A. oligospora led to increased amounts of the furanone attractant (2-fold) in mutants and enhanced the attractive activity (1.5-fold) of the fungus, while it resulted in decreased trap formation. This investigation provides new insights regarding the comprehensive tactics of fungal adaptation to environmental stress, integrating both morphological and metabolomic mechanisms. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.","52","Fungi","Algae - Biomolecules - Gas chromatography - Mass spectrometry - Metabolism - Metabolites - Polysaccharides - Volatile organic compounds","Arthrobotrys oligospora - Comparative analysis - Environmental stress - Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry - Metabolic adaptation - Nematode trapping fungi - Pathogenicity - Potato dextrose agars","801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 31470169, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1502262, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; ","This work was sponsored by NSFC grant/project numbers U1502262 and 31470169 and the Yunnan University Program for Excellent Young Talents, awarded to X.-M.N.

Results show that O2-Ge-CNT oxidized the CN molecule via the Ge-CNT-O-O∗+ CN → Ge-CNT-O-O∗-CN → Ge-CNT-O∗+ OCN and the Ge-CNT-O∗+ CN → Ge-CNT + OCN reactions. Results show that oxidation of CN on surface of Ge-CNT via the LH mechanism has lower energy barrier than ER mechanism. Finally, calculated parameters reveal that Ge-CNT is acceptable catalyst with high performance for CN oxidation, form theoretical point of view. © 2018","49","Carbon nanotubes","Catalysts - Cyanides - Germanium compounds - Molecules - Nanostructures - Oxidation - Yarn","Adsorption energies - CN molecule - Cyanide oxidation - DFT study - Langmuir-Hinshelwood - Lower energy barriers - Oxidation reactions - Theoretical points","761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 819.4 Fiber Products - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933 Solid State Physics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In addition, vortex-induced vibration velocity is obtained and factors such as wind attack angle and damping ratio are discussed. Using a real bridge as an example, several conclusions are drawn. First, the frequency of vortex shedding is very close to the natural frequency at a wind speed of 45 m/s and a wind attack angle of 0°. At this wind speed, the displacement reaches maximum and the section vortex-excited resonance occurs, which leads to the gradual appearance of a periodic alternating vortex with a relatively uniform size and space. Second, the maximum displacement and maximum lift will change as the wind attack angle changes at 45 m/s and the maximum displacement occurs at the wind attack angle of 0°. Finally, the maximum displacement decreases with increasing damping ratio, and the damping ratio can effectively limit the displacement response amplitude to a certain degree. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","5","Steel bridges","Damping - Hydraulic structures - Hydraulics - Numerical methods - Runge Kutta methods - Shore protection - Vibration analysis - Vortex flow - Vortex shedding - Wind - Wind tunnels","Displacement response - Mass-spring-damper system - Maximum displacement - Numerical wind tunnels - Steel bridge members - Vortex excited resonance - Vortex induced vibration - Wind induced vibrations","401.1 Bridges - 407.1 Maritime Structures - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 632.1 Hydraulics - 651.2 Wind Tunnels - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.1 Mechanics","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sinopec Ministry of Science and Technology Basic Prospective Research Project; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chongqing Municipal Education Commission; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (No. KJ130409).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this paper, the glass-transitions in thin-film organic semiconductors are investigated by using various temperature spectroscopic ellipsometer. We observed that glass transition temperatures in organic thin films are characterized by a disruptive change in thickness vs. temperature plot. In order to modify the glass transition temperature of an organic semiconductor, we also made composite thin-films by inclusion of another organic molecule with higher Tg. We found that the transition temperature can be significantly improved by inclusion of another organic molecule. The glass-transition processes of these composite semiconductors, however, also proceed in a disruptive manner, in stark contrast to typical polymeric materials. Despite this disruptive glass transition behavior, the experimental Tg of the composite semiconductors are found to follow precisely a simple inverse sum equation of constituent temperatures with their respective weight factors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","37","Glass transition","Composite films - Ellipsometry - Molecules - Polymeric glass - Semiconducting organic compounds - Temperature - Thin films","Change in thickness - Composite thin films - Glass transition behavior - Glass transition temperature Tg - Molecular materials - Organic thin films - Spectroscopic ellipsometers - Transition process","641.1 Thermodynamics - 712.1.2 Compound Semiconducting Materials - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Number: 2017YDQN07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: U1402273, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1402273 and 11774304 ), from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada , and from the Yunnan University (Grant No. 2017YDQN07 ).
