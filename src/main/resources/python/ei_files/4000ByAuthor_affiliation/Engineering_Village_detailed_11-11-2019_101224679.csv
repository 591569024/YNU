Nevertheless, how microbial residue contribution to bulk SOC sequestration changes following land use conversion remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the variation of soil microbial residue C and its contribution to SOC following conversion of maize-soybean field to mulberry, forage grass and sugarcane fields in southwest China, with forest used as reference. Microbial residue C contents were estimated based on microbial cell wall biomarker amino sugars. The contents of fungal, bacterial and total microbial residue C were lowest in the sugarcane, maize-soybean and mulberry fields, intermediate in the forage grass field and highest in the forest. Fungal to bacterial residue C ratios were comparable among the five land use types, implying that the relative contribution of fungi and bacteria residues to SOC sequestration remained unchanged. Conversion of maize-soybean field to mulberry and sugarcane fields had no significant effect on microbial residue contribution to SOC sequestration.

Significant improvements in the peak temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) and resistivity (ρ) were observed across all ceramic samples when the mol% of Sr was adjusted. The low ρ and large TCR values resulted from a combination of two factors. First, the presence of Sr led to the increase in the grain size and decrease in the number of boundaries, which improved the electrical transport and reduced the boundary scattering effects. This resulted in additional improvement in the grain arrangement order. Second, the cell volume (Vcell) and octahedron volume (Voct) both decreased first and then increased. The MnO6 octahedron underwent gradual deformation into a flattened shape, which facilitated carrier migration and increased electrical sensitivity of the material. The ceramic with x = 0.03 maintained high and stable TCR values in different working environments, both without a magnetic field (TCRo, 54.76% K−1) and in the presence of a vertical field (TCR⊥, 33.33% K−1). Furthermore, the material exhibited a low resistivity and a higher insulator–metal transition temperature (Tp). Performance differences among the samples were comprehensively and systematically explained by conducting cross magnetic field tests with field directions parallel and perpendicular to the flat surface of the bulk material, respectively.

When the system is in steady-state operation, the frequency of the generator in the system is equal under steady-state operation. Because the load is changing at any time, this kind of balance is dynamic. The only way to maintain dynamic balance is to adjust the input power of the generator, so that the actual output of the generator can closely track the change of the load and keep the balance between supply and demand of active power. The essence of frequency control is to regulate and control the active power of all generators in power grid. In this paper, the principle of frequency fluctuation is analyzed, and the physical models of the primary and secondary frequency modulation are established. The simulation results verify the differential regulation of the primary frequency modulation and the no-difference regulation of secondary frequency modulation.

It is found that the mountain height and the inclination angle have a significant effect on the lightning-radiated electromagnetic field both for the close and far observing distances. For the lightning-radiated vertical electric field, the enhancement of the far field beyond several kilometers (mainly radiation field component) is due to the reflection process in the transition between the mountain terrain and the flat ground, but the reduction of close field near the mountain terrain (mainly quasi-electrostatic field component) is due to the shadowing effect, but not due to such reflection.

In this paper, amorphous silicon dioxide and the Si core – SiO2 shell structure was systematically characterized and confirmed. A thermodynamic calculation was then carried out to analyze the reduction reaction probability of silicon dioxide by vacuum carbothermal reduction. The results indicated that the reduction reaction could occur under the vacuum condition with lower temperature, while it could not under that of the atmospheric condition. Further, experiments were conducted to verify the reliability of the thermodynamic analysis, which are keeping in good agreement with thermodynamic results. Finally, the results confirmed that the vacuum carbothermal reduction method is a feasible alternative for silicon recovery from the DWSSP.

This makes it an excellent candidate as an organic linker in the construction of photochromic complexes. Such a photochromic three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic framework (MOF) has been prepared using this ligand. Crystallization of tpt with Cd(NO3)2·4H2O in anN,N-dimethy lacetamide-methanol mixed-solvent system under solvothermal conditions afforded the 3D MOF poly[[bis­(nitrato-κ2O,O′)cadmium(II)]-μ3-2,4,6-tris(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-κ3N2:N4:N6], [Cd(NO3)2(C18H12N6)]n, which was characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The X-ray diffraction crystal structure analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit contains one independent CdIIcation, one tpt ligand and two coordinated NO3−anions. The CdIIcations are connected by tpt ligands to generate a 3D framework. The single framework leaves voids that are filled by mutual inter­penetration of three independent equivalent frameworks in a fourfold interpenetrating architecture. The compound shows a good thermal stability and exhibits a reversible photochromic behaviour, which may originate from the photoinduced electron-transfer generation of radicals in the tpt ligand. © 2019 International Union of Crystallography.","38","Cadmium compounds","Crystal structure - Crystalline materials - Electron transitions - Free radical reactions - Ligands - Luminescence - Metal analysis - Molecules - Organic solvents - Organometallics - Photochromism - Single crystals - Thermogravimetric analysis - X ray diffraction","5-triazine - 6-tris(pyridin-4-yl)-1 - Crystal structure analysis - Metal organic framework - Photo-induced electron transfer - Photochromic properties - Single crystal x-ray diffraction - Solvothermal conditions","741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 2017FD144, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Funding for this research was provided by: Yunnan Province Thousand Youth Talents Plan, Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department (award No. 2017FD144).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 20% in PSCs have been mostly achieved by employing a Spiro-OMeTAD-based HTM. However, it suffers from some drawbacks such as relatively low hole-mobility, complicated synthesis and difficult purification, which hamper its potential commercial applications. Here, for the first time, two new easily accessible 9,9-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted fluorene-based HTMs comprising H (YT1) and methoxyphenyl-fluorene (YT3) as the terminated groups have been synthesized for use in organic-inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic PSCs. The (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and CsPbI2Br PSCs based on YT3 yield very impressive PCEs of 20.23% and 13.36%, respectively, both of which are higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (19.18% and 12.30%). More encouragingly, the YT3-based PSC displays good long-term stability for 600 hours. These results confirm that different terminated groups in HTMs show a significant effect on the energy levels, hole extraction and transfer, thin-film surface morphology and photovoltaic performance.

We demonstrated that this method could be applied to detect adulteration of natural nicotine with as low as 20% synthetic nicotine, without the need to measure the site-specific δD values, which usually required time-consuming quantitative 2H NMR and additional IRMS for the overall 2H/1H isotopic ratio determination. The distinguishable 2H/1H SPIRs of nicotine, which can be quickly measured by NMR in non-quantitative way, can serve as an attractive alternative tool for tobacco authentication.

The degree-day model (DDM) coupled with the Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) model were used to quantify the water budget of the Nam Co Lake over the period of 2007 to 2013. Driven by local observed meteorological data, the coupled model was successfully validated with the observed lake levels (with R2 = 0.65, NSE = 0.61, and PBIAS = -2.26). Analysis of the water balance revealed that rapid enlargement of the Nam Co Lake was primarily associated with precipitation increase while glacier melt played its role as the potential secondary driver in lake expansion. However, temporal analysis of lake expansion displayed that supremacy of precipitation and glacier melt interchanged between the years. It was found that average annual relative contributions of the precipitation, including direct precipitation on the lake, and glacier melt to the lake were 57% (or 667 mm), and 43% (or 502 mm), respectively. Besides, it was observed that annual values of actual evapotranspiration (ET) from the lake, glaciated, and non-glaciated subbasins were 615 mm, 280 mm, and 234 mm respectively. The average annual glacier mass balance (GMB) of the Nam Co basin was -150.9 millimeter water equivalent (mm w.e.). The relatively high amount of glacier melt was a consequence of the substantial increase in annual temperature in the lake basin. This work is of importance for understanding the rapid water cycle in the TP under global warming. Moreover, this work will also be helpful in monitoring and sustaining the local ecosystem and infrastructure, which is under risk due to rapid lake expansion as a result of climate change in the TP. © 2019 by the authors.","65","Lakes","Budget control - Expansion - Global warming","Degree-day model - Glacier mass balance - Nam Co basin - SWAT model - Water balance","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 951 Materials Science","Number: 41630754, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41721091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are thankful to the Third Pole Environment (TPE), Institute of Tibetan Plateau, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences for providing us hydro-meteorological data to conduct this study.

The wavelengths of the two resonant peak changes are used to monitor the variations of the curvature and temperature due to different responses. The experimental results show that the curvature sensitivities of the two peaks are −7.056 nm/m-1 and −21.080 nm/m-1, respectively. The curvature sensitivity is bigger than that of the common LPFG.

Current studies on POI recommendation in LBSNs mainly focus on modeling multiple factors extracted from users’ profiles and checking-in records. Data sparsity and incompleteness of user-POI interaction matrix are very common problems in POI recommendation, especially for the out-of-town scenario. Another challenge is that most information in the LBSNs is unreliable due to users’ different backgrounds or preferences. Because of the close relationship between users, information from trustable friends on Communication-Based Social Networks (CBSNs) is more valuable than that in LBSNs, which can give a preferable suggestion instead of trustless reviews in LBSNs. In this study, we propose a latent probabilistic generative model called HI-LDA (Heterogeneous Information based LDA), which can accurately capture users’ words on CBSNs by taking into full consideration the information on LBSNs including geographical effect as well as the abundant information including social relationship, users’ interactive behaviors and comment content. In particular, the parameters of the HI-LDA model can be inferred by the Gibbs sampling method in an effective fashion. Beyond these proposed techniques, we introduce an POI recommendation framework integrating geographical clustering approach considering the locations and popularity of POIs simultaneously. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on two real heterogeneous LBSN-CBSN networks. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HI-LDA on effective and efficient POI recommendation in both home-town and out-of-town scenarios, when compared with the state-of-the-art baseline approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","34","Recommender systems","Beryllium compounds - Heterogeneous networks - Location","Geographical clustering - Gibbs sampling methods - Heterogeneous information - Interactive behavior - Location-based social networks - POI recommendation - Probabilistic graphical models - Social relationships","723.5 Computer Applications","Number: 2018GZ0253, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; Number: 2018JY0448, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; Number: 2019YFG0106, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; Number: 2019YFS0067, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; Number: 61772091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61802035, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61962006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61772091 61802035 and 61962006 the Youth Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China under Grant No. 17YJCZH202; the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant Nos. 2018JY0448, 2019YFG0106, 2019YFS0067 and 2018GZ0253; the Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi under Grant No. 2018GXNSFDA138005; the Innovative Research Team Construction Plan in Universities of Sichuan Province under Grant No. 18TD0027; the Scientific Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Chengdu University of Information Technology under Grant Nos.

Herein, we modify the NCM cathode materials by substituting the boracic polyanion to suppress capacity degradation and improve power performance. The crystal structure, morphology, elemental states and surface elemental composition of the cathode materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Compared to the bare NCM, the I(003)/I(104) ratio of the B3-NCM sample increases from 1.58 to 1.66, and the cation mixing declines from 4.65% to 3.21%, as known by XRD and Rietveld refinement. The results of electrochemical tests indicate that the B1-NCM exhibit superior rate property at the high current density (131.02 mAh g−1 at 5 C), and the higher capacity retention (76.07% after 100 cycles at 1 C). Further electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) demonstrate that boracic polyanion doping decreases impedance value and enhances lithium ion diffusion coefficient.

Na2S addition benefited the dissolution rate of smithsonite in deionized water. Visual MINTEQ model results confirmed that the zinc sulfide precipitation formed after the main sulfidation reaction between Zn(OH)2(aq) and HS− ions at pH 10, compared with the conversion from ZnS(aq), Zn2S32− ions, and Zn4S64− ions to sphalerite. Moreover, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the average crystallite sizes of zinc sulfide precipitation particle obtained by co-precipitation technique were approximately 2.32 nm in size. These particles were composed of zinc monosulfide and zinc polysulfide. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and XPS analysis provided strong evidence for zinc sulfide precipitation adsorption on the smithsonite surfaces.

In this province, the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate play prominent roles and significantly influence the rice water requirement (ETc) and irrigation quota (IQ), while the research about the influence mechanism and results is lacking. We estimated the rice ETc and IQ of different hydrological years based on the experimental data from six areas of mid-season rice and the single crop efficient approach recommended by FAO-56. The contour maps were drawn with GIS, and the spatial distribution of the rice ETc and IQ under the influence of the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate were analyzed. The results showed that high water ETc and IQ of rice were distributed in the hot, dry river valley area. The rice ETc was the smallest in northwestern Yunnan, and the IQ was the smallest in southern Yunnan. The ETc and IQ of rice were divided into several intervals by mountains and valleys, and varied largely among different channels and little within one channel. The three-dimensional climate results in the abrupt changes of ETc and IQ, The leading meteorological factors causing the abrupt changes were different, and there were also complex correlations between these meteorological factors. Taken together, temperature and rainfall were the most critical elements in the three-dimensional climate. The results of this study illustrated the regularity and inherent mechanism of the rice ETc and IQ under the influences of the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate, providing certain references for the analyses and calculation of the rice ETc and IQ in similar circumstances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","32","Water resources","Crops - Geographic information systems - Irrigation - Landforms","Complex correlation - Crop coefficient - Influence mechanism - Meteorological factors - Northwestern Yunnan - Spatial variability - Water balance equation - Water requirements","444 Water Resources - 481.1 Geology - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use","Number: 2015BB019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 2016NSK01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: NSFC 51579184, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 51579184 ), the Open Research Fund Program of State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science ( 2016NSK01 ) and the Yunnan Provincial Science Technology Department ( 2015BB019 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This makes it an excellent candidate as an organic linker in the construction of photochromic complexes. Such a photochromic three-dimensional (3D) metal–organic framework (MOF) has been prepared using this ligand. Crystallization of tpt with Cd(NO3)2·4H2O in an N,N-dimethylacetamide–methanol mixed-solvent system under solvothermal conditions afforded the 3D MOF poly[[bis(nitrato-κ2O,O′)cadmium(II)]-μ3-2,4,6-tris(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-κ3N2:N4:N6], [Cd(NO3)2(C18H12N6)]n, which was characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The X-ray diffraction crystal structure analysis reveals that the asymmetric unit contains one independent CdII cation, one tpt ligand and two coordinated NO3− anions. The CdII cations are connected by tpt ligands to generate a 3D framework. The single framework leaves voids that are filled by mutual interpenetration of three independent equivalent frameworks in a fourfold interpenetrating architecture. The compound shows a good thermal stability and exhibits a reversible photochromic behaviour, which may originate from the photoinduced electron-transfer generation of radicals in the tpt ligand. © International Union of Crystallography, 2019",,"Cadmium compounds","Crystal structure - Electron transitions - Free radical reactions - Ligands - Luminescence - Metal analysis - Molecules - Organic solvents - Photochromism - Positive ions - Single crystals - Thermogravimetric analysis - X ray diffraction","2,4,6-tris(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine - Crystal structure analysis - N , N-dimethylacetamide - Photo-induced electron transfer - Photochromic behaviour - Photochromic properties - Single crystal x-ray diffraction - Solvothermal conditions","741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 2017FD144, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Funding for this research was provided by: Yunnan Province Thousand Youth Talents Plan, Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department (award No. 2017FD144).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Enormous medical images are constantly generated by various health monitoring and sensing devices, such as ultrasound, MRI machines. Hence, based on pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) and the classical visual receptive field (CVRF) with the difference of two Gaussians (DOG), a contrast enhancement of MRI image is suggested to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis for smarter mobile healthcare. As one premise, the parameters of DOG are estimated from the fundamentals of CVRF; then the PCNN parameters in image enhancement are estimated eventually with the help of DOG. As a result, the MRI images can be enhanced adaptively. Due to the exponential decay of the dynamic threshold and the pulses coupling among neurons, PCNN effectively enhances the contrast of low grey levels in MRI image. Moreover, because of the inhibitory effects from inhibitory region in CVRF, PCNN also effectively preserves the structures such as edges for enhanced results. Experiments on several MRI images show that the proposed method performs better than other methods by improving contrast and preserving structures well. © 2018, The Author(s).","44","Image enhancement","Big data - Diagnosis - Health care - Magnetic resonance imaging - Medical imaging - Neural networks","Clinical diagnosis - Contrast Enhancement - Exponential decays - Inhibitory effect - Measurement techniques - MRI Image - Pulse coupled neural network - Visual receptive fields","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 461.7 Health Care - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 746 Imaging Techniques","Number: 171740, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 61463049, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 61463052 and 61463049) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (no. 171740).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, it is controversial whether the above environmental factors can explain observed diversity patterns in varied communities such as invertebrate taxonomic group, especially mollusks. Moreover, there are until now few systematic assessments of the relative roles of different factors in determining the patterns of mollusk species diversity in monsoon-dominated regions. Here, we depict variations in terrestrial mollusk diversity based on a dataset comprising 282 assemblages collected from surface soils along an ~800-km climatic gradient from subtropical to warm temperate and mid-temperate regions in northern China. The results show that mollusk species diversity increases significantly from ~3–4 species to ~17–19 species when annual temperature and precipitation increase up to ~12 °C and ~700 mm, respectively; however, at or above these values the rate of increase is reduced. These indicate that the relationships between mollusk species diversity and climatic factors are nonlinear. Statistical analysis suggests that water availability (relative humidity) and temperature seasonality (January temperature and annual temperature range) dominate the observed pattern of mollusk species diversity. Moreover, habitat factors such as vegetation condition and soil types were also important in determining mollusk species diversity. They may be an indirect reflection of the effects of monsoonal water-energy dynamic on mollusk communities. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to water availability and temperature seasonality in predicting future biodiversity changes, especially in the environmentally stressed northwestern part of the East Asian monsoon region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","74","Molluscs","Atmospheric thermodynamics - Biodiversity - Ecosystems","Climate gradients - East Asian monsoon - Seasonality - Terrestrial mollusks - Water availability","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography","Number: 2017M620895, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 41430103, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41702195, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41772186, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: XDB26000000, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","We thank Drs.

Conversion of pervious land to impervious surfaces leads to increased runoff volume, peak flow rate, and pollutant load, as well as reduced groundwater recharge. The last two decades has witnessed a paradigm shift in stormwater management, with the traditional 'end-of-pipe' stormwater best management practices (BMPs) being replaced with green infrastructures (GIs). Using low impact development (LID) practices to treat runoff at its source, the goal for GI design is to mimic pre-development runoff conditions. This study evaluates and compares several stormwater management alternatives in a high-plateau watershed in southwest China, where unique landscape, climate, and eco-sensitive locations make sustainable stormwater a challenging task. Two GI-only, one gray-only, and one hybrid stormwater management designs were assessed for the watershed. The results indicate that while the gray-only scenario is relatively effective in reducing post-development peak flow rates (around 30%), it is much less effective (12%) in reducing runoff volume. In comparison, the GI-only scenario is less effective in reducing peak flow rates (11% to 29%). The hybrid stormwater management approach, however, is able to strike a balance between reducing post-development runoff volume (66%), peak flow rate (36% to 68%), and pollutant load (over 80%), and at the same time encouraging groundwater recharge and rain water reuse. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","22","Runoff","Engineering geology - Environmental technology - Flow rate - Groundwater pollution - Recharging (underground waters) - Storm sewers - Storms - Wastewater reclamation - Water conservation - Water quality - Watersheds","Green infrastructure - Ground water recharge - Impervious surface - Low impact development - Natural runoff conditions - Storm-water managements - Stormwater best management practices - Water quality impact","443.3 Precipitation - 444 Water Resources - 445.2 Water Analysis - 452.1 Sewage - 452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 454 Environmental Engineering - 631 Fluid Flow",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Owing to the excellent microwave absorption properties of low-grade pyrolusite with 10% coal (22 g), it could be heated to a temperature of 800°C within 200 s.

Therefore, CSD prediction based on the mechanism model of the reactive crystallization process of barium carbonate is investigated in this work. The dynamic variation of the whole CSD was reconstructed during the growth and nucleation processes of barium carbonate by solving the population balance equations (PBEs) using combination of the method of characteristics (MOCH) with the quadrature method of moments (QMOM). The parameters of crystal nucleation and size-dependent growth model are identified by capturing real-time laboratory experimental data with process analytical technologies (PATs). Meanwhile, the optimal operating conditions for barium carbonate reactive crystallization processes can be determined, and an optimization approach is used to obtain the target CSD at the end of a batch crystallization process. The computational process is evaluated by experimentations and found that experimental CSDs agree with the simulated values.

However, the variations in microbial diversity and community composition within degraded landscapes remain unclear. Using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and internal transcribed spacer fungal sequences, we investigated the rhizosphere microbial diversity and community of coniferous Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. forests in degraded lands across a chronosequence that spanned over 60 years (10, 25, 40, and 60 years since restoration, four forest stands). We found significant differences in soil bacterial and fungal communities among stand ages. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria dominated the rhizosphere, whereas Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota prevailed as fungal components. With stand development, bacterial diversity decreased, but fungal diversity increased. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis separated bacterial community clusters well by stands. Fungal community clusters of 25- and 60-year-old stands overlapped. The dominant bacteria Acidobacteria showed the highest relative abundance at the 40-year-old stands. Soil microbial communities correlated significantly with the macro-nutrients (soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorous). Additionally, the relative abundance of Acidobacteria at the phylum level correlated positively with soil total phosphorous; Deltaproteobacteria at the class level correlated positively with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. Thus, restoring vegetation in degraded temperate forests enhanced some macronutrients and influenced microbial communities. Our results revealed that restoring vegetation in degraded lands decreased the diversity of bacterial communities over time. In contrast, the soil fungal diversity increased after restoration, and fungal communities in the 25- and 60-year-old forest stands overlapped on degraded soils. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","69","Fungi","Bacteria - Conservation - Ecosystems - Forestry - Nitrogen - Nutrients - Organic carbon - Phosphorus - Restoration - RNA - Soils - Transcription - Vegetation","Ecological restoration - Illumina - Internal transcribed spacers - Microbial communities - Microbial diversity",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The antibacterial effect of the prepared hybrid materials on Escherichia coli (E. coli) was investigated by the plate coating method. The presence of the Ti–O–Si bond between anatase-TiO2 and SiO2 was confirmed by the above characterization methods, which was beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic inactivation effect of E. coli under ultraviolet-light (UVA) irradiation and visible-light irradiation. With the increase in the TiO2 content from 1.5% to 4.4%, antibacterial activities were clearly enhanced under different types of light irradiation. For the optimum sample of 4.4%-TiO2@SiO2, antibacterial rates of 99.3% and 90.5% under UVA irradiation and visible-light irradiation were obtained, respectively. The antibacterial mechanism was demonstrated by fluorescence detection of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and SEM images of the changes in the bacterial morphology. Results revealed that the hybrid materials can generate ROS under not only UVA irradiation but also visible-light irradiation. A majority of the ROS migrated into the bacterial cells and caused the oxidative damage of cells.

The characteristics of stress field and plastic zone on the cross and longitudinal section of the tunnel were analyzed in detail, and the results were compared with those in the intrinsic condition (when TBM model is not activated). The simulation results indicate that the stress paths at the vault are relatively simple, and the stress concentration caused by excavation unloading is obviously reduced by lining and backfill grouting, while the sidewall is less disturbed by the excavation of TBM. The invert experiences three unloading processes, due to excavation, the contact between the rear shield and the bottom of surrounding rock, as well as backfill grouting at gap between the lining and the rock mass. The vault has a larger plastic zone than the invert, attributing to the geometrical difference between the cutter-head and the front shield, as well as the conicity of the front and rear shields. The area of plastic zones gradually increases along the tunnel route, but it becomes stable after the rear shield. © 2019 Diyuan Li, et al.","26","Rock mechanics","Boring machines (machine tools) - Concrete construction - Construction equipment - Excavation - Grouting - Mortar - Numerical methods - Rocks - Shielding - Stresses - Tunneling machines - Unloading","Excavation unloading - Geometrical differences - Longitudinal section - Nonuniform gap - Plastic zones - Shield tunnel - Stress field - Surrounding rock mass","405.1 Construction Equipment - 405.2 Construction Methods - 412 Concrete - 414.3 Mortar (Before 1993, use code 412) - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 603.1 Machine Tools, General - 691.2 Materials Handling Methods - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 2018zzts723, Acronym: CSU, Sponsor: Central South University; Number: 51474250, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51474250), the State Key Research Development Program of China (2016YFC0600706), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (2018zzts723).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, many 'Gusuibu' adulterants which are morphologically similar, have been widely used in China. It is important to develop DNA-based markers to efficiently distinguish authentic 'Gusuibu' from adulterants. In this study, 21 chloroplast genomes from seven species including D. roosii and six 'Gusuibu' adulterant species were sequenced. The chloroplast genomes of D. roosii, D. sinica Diels, D. bonii Christ, D. delavayi Christ, D. quercifolia (L.) J. Sm., D. propinqua (Wall.) J. Sm., and Pseudodrynaria coronans (Wall.)

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that whole chloroplast genomes could be used to distinguish D. roosii from adulterants and between each adulterant. Comparing chloroplast genome sequences, 12 protein-coding genes and eight intergenic sequences with high divergence in chloroplast genomes were identified to exploit specific DNA barcodes and sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. One specific DNA barcode and three SCAR markers, which were available to distinguish D. roosii from adulterants, were developed and four primer pairs were designed.

Micro-flotation tests indicated that the smithsonite flotation in a PbNO3 solution (5 × 10−5 mol/L) was approximately doubled with respect to that without Pb ion modification, where the xanthate functioned as a collector. The results of inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy suggested that the modification of Pb ions can be achieved via ion adsorption and exchange on the mineral surface. The potential structure of a Pb-modified smithsonite surface was investigated via Visual MINTEQ and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. During the modification, large amounts of Pb species, including PbCO3 and Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2, were formed on the smithsonite surface. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry indicated that Pb modification increased the number of active Pb sites for xanthate adsorption to improve the formation of hydrophobic Pb-xanthate precipitate. The adsorption tests revealed that Pb modification enhanced the stability of the xanthate products on the smithsonite surface. Therefore, the interaction of Pb ions with the smithsonite surfaces enhanced the strength and stability of the hydrophobic layer, resulting in the enhanced hydrophobization of smithsonite. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","67","Ions","Adsorption - Flotation - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Hydrophobicity - Inductively coupled plasma - Ion exchange - Lead compounds - Secondary ion mass spectrometry - Surface treatment - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Hydrophobic layers - Hydrophobizations - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopies - Lead ions - Potential structure - Smithsonite - Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry - Xanthate","801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 932.3 Plasma Physics","Number: 51464029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51504109, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51664027, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51804144, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51804144, 51504109, 51664027 and 51464029) and the Own project of State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization (Grant No. CNMRCUTS1709).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This study indicates 2.5 at% Co2+ doping is sufficient to alter the collinear easy-axis magnetic structure of Mn4Nb2O9 into the noncollinear easy-plane magnetic structure, which is attributed to the large easy-plane anisotropy of Co2+ and relative small Ising-like anisotropy of Mn2+. The doping effects on the Néel temperature and occupancy are also discussed. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","29","Magnetic structure","Band structure - Cobalt compounds - Magnetic anisotropy - Magnetic moments - Manganese compounds - Neutron powder diffraction - Niobium compounds - Rietveld refinement","Collinear antiferromagnetic structure - Irreducible representations - magnetoelectric - Magnetoelectric materials - Multiferroics - Rietveld refinement method - Single ion anisotropy - Spin reorientation","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801 Chemistry - 933 Solid State Physics - 944.8 Radiation Measurements",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Heavy rainfall is the inducement factor of this debris flow. The complex topographic and geomorphological features in the channel provide conditions for the evolution and scale-up of the debris flow: (1) hundreds of shallow soil landslides in the region provide sufficient material resources for the debris flow, enhance the hydrodynamic conditions of the debris flow and increase the amount of erosion along the way; (2) multiple bedrock entrapments and falls in the channel enlarged the debris flow. The scale and velocity of debris flow; (3) The volume weight of debris flow increases gradually with the supply of solid materials along the way. The study shows that precipitation is the fundamental cause of debris flow. The precipitation causes the initiation and overlap of landslide, slope and channel sources in the valley. From the development trend, the debris flow in the valley is in the stage of high frequency development, and the possibility of large-scale debris flow still exists. The possibility and frequency of occurrence will be greatly increased. High frequency and small and medium-sized debris flows will be the characteristics of debris flow activities in this gully in the future.

However, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, the de-noising function of it is often not ideal. Thus, a new fault feature extraction method for rolling bearing combining EEMD and improved frequency band entropy (IFBE) is proposed, i.e., EEMD–IFBE. According to the problem of multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) generated by EEMD, how to select the sensitive IMF(s) that can better reflect fault characteristics, a novel method based on FBE for sensitive IMF is proposed. In addition, since the bandwidth parameter is set empirically when the band-pass filter is designed based on the original FBE, a novel bandwidth parameter optimization method based on the principle of maximum envelope kurtosis is proposed. First, the original vibration signal is subjected to EEMD to obtain a series of IMFs; Then, the FBE values are obtained for the original signal and each IMF component, and the bandwidth of the band-pass filter (empirically) is designed as the characteristic frequency band at the minimum entropy value, and the affiliation between the characteristic frequency band of each IMF and the characteristic frequency band of the original signal is compared, and then selecting the sensitive IMF(s) that reflects the characteristics of the fault; Third, due to the influence of background noise, it is difficult to accurately obtain the fault frequency from the selected IMF(s). Therefore, the band-pass filter designed based on FBE is used, and the bandwidth parameter is optimized based on the principle of envelope kurtosis maximum, and then the selected sensitive IMF is band-pass filtered. Finally, the envelope power spectrum analysis is performed on the filtered signal to extract the fault characteristic frequency, and then the fault diagnosis of the bearing is realized. The method is successfully applied to simulated data and actual data of rolling bearing, which can accurately diagnose fault characteristics of bearing and prove the effectiveness and advantages of the method. © 2018 ISA","45","Signal processing","Bandpass filters - Bandwidth - Condition monitoring - Entropy - Extraction - Failure analysis - Fault detection - Feature extraction - Higher order statistics - Roller bearings - Signal to noise ratio - Spectrum analysis - Speed control","Characteristic frequencies - Ensemble empirical mode decomposition - Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD) - Envelope kurtosis - Fault feature extractions - Intrinsic Mode functions - Parameter optimization - Rolling bearings",,"Number: 2017FA028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51465022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (Grant Nos. 51465022 ), Key scientific research projects of Yunnan Province (Grant Nos. 201601PE00008 , 2017FA028 ), and Yunnan Province Personal Training Projects (Grant Nos.

However, on the one hand, the ACO algorithm has defects including long search times and convergence issues with non-optimal solutions. On the other hand, given bottlenecks such as memory restrictions, time complexity, or data complexity, it is too hard to solve a problem when its scale becomes too large. One solution for this issue is to design a highly parallelized learning algorithm. The MapReduce programming model has quickly emerged as the most common model for executing simple algorithmic tasks over huge volumes of data, since it is simple, highly abstract, and efficient. Therefore, MapReduce-based ACO has been researched extensively. However, due to its unidirectional communication model and the inherent lack of support for iterative execution, ACO algorithms cannot easily be implemented on MapReduce. In this paper, a novel classification rule discovery algorithm is proposed, namely MR-AntMiner, which can capitalize on the benefits of the MapReduce model. In order to construct quality rules with fewer iterations as well as less communication between different nodes to share the parameters used by each ant, our algorithm splits the training data into some subsets that are randomly mapped to different mappers; then the traditional ACO algorithm is run on each mapper to gain the local best rule set, and the global best rule list is produced in the reducer phase according to a voting mechanism. The performance of our algorithm was studied experimentally on 14 publicly available data sets and further compared to several state-of-the-art classification approaches in terms of accuracy. The experimental results show that the predictive accuracy obtained by our algorithm is statistically higher than that of the compared targets. Furthermore, experimental studies show the feasibility and the good performance of the proposed parallelized MR-AntMiner algorithm. © 2019 Fuji Technology Press.

Eight ice blocks were sampled from the bottom of the glacier at three different sites along the southern edges. The 81Kr data yield upper age limits in the range of 15–74 ka (90% confidence level). This is an order of magnitude lower than the ages exceeding 500 ka which the previous 36Cl data suggest for the bottom of the Guliya ice core.

However, the acclimation process and the underlying microbial mechanisms involved have not yet been fully explicated. This study investigated the effects of food waste and KH2PO4 on inoculum acclimation within the microbial community utilizing the 16S rRNA MiSeq Illumina platform. The acclimated inoculum was created by adding 1 g/d food waste, 1360 mg/L KH2PO4, and then acclimated from the 8th d to 21st d. This medium produced superior inoculum with high gas production, high microbial diversity, and a stable process system. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Euryarchaeota, and Chloroflexi were predominantly found within the microbial community, which played an active role during anaerobic digestion. Moreover, microbial diversity, composition, and relative abundance varied by acclimation process. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Synergistetes, and Fusobacteria had increased in the acclimated inoculum, while that of Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota had decreased. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Fusobacteria when based upon the number of Operational Taxonomic Units was positively correlated with biogas production. This study provides new insights into the understanding of variation, as it relates to inoculum functioning and the microbial community during acclimation. Thus, this process could be utilized to obtain superior inoculum, while optimizing reactor conditions to produce higher biodegradation efficiency from food waste. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","62","Food microbiology","Anaerobic digestion - Biodegradation - Correlation methods - Microorganisms - RNA - Sludge digestion - Stability criteria","Acclimation - Food waste - High-throughput sequencing - Inoculum - Microbial communities","452.2 Sewage Treatment - 461 Bioengineering and Biology - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science","Number: 41561108, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41561108 ).

In this study, a novel texture modification process based on employing in-plane precompression, prestretching and annealing was carried out on an extruded Mg-3Al-1Zn (AZ31) sheet to introduce an orthogonal four-peak distribution of basal texture. The results indicated that such an orthogonal four-peak texture could provide larger and more balanced Schmid factors for basal slip compared with that of the as-extruded sheet when the sheets subject to tension along different directions. As expected, the tensile yield strength was decreased and the ductility was increased effectively, suggesting a considerable improvement in uniaxial deformation ability. Additionally, the orthogonal four-peak texture could also provide more balanced mechanical properties along different directions and contribute to reducing the planar anisotropy. Erichsen tests showed that the Erichsen value of the sample with orthogonal four-peak texture increased up to ∼115% compared with that of the as-extruded sheet. This finding indicated that such a texture modification method was also highly conducive to enhancing the multiaxial stretch formability of the Mg sheets. The orthogonal four-peak texture modification was confirmed as an efficient way to improve the comprehensive mechanical performance of the Mg alloy sheets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","56","Magnesium alloys","Aluminum alloys - Magnesium printing plates - Mechanical properties - Microstructure - Rolling - Tensile strength - Ternary alloys - Textures - Zinc alloys","Mechanical performance - Planar anisotropy - Pre-compression - Stretch formability - Tensile yield strength - Texture modification - Uniaxial deformation - Wrought magnesium alloys","541.2 Aluminum Alloys - 542.2 Magnesium and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 745.1.1 Printing Equipment - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2018ZE001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016YFB0301104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 106112016CDJZR138801, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: 2018ZE023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1764253, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for the financial supports from the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2016YFB0301104 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( U1502272 , 51801179 , 51531002 and U1764253 ), Yunnan Science and Technology Projects Grants ( 2018ZE001 , 2018ZE006 and 2018ZE021 ), Platform project of Materials Genome Institute of Yunnan University ( 2018ZE023 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds the Central Universities ( 106112016CDJZR138801 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The problem of sudden drift detection was transformed into local completeness computing problem of the given log. Then Chebyshev inequality was used to deduce the expression of local completeness based on direct succession and frequency. To avoid the interference of exclusiveness and concurrency, a training window was adopted to calculate the initial value of local completeness. In addition, the cutting operation was defined to ensure that the algorithm could run iteratively until all traces in log had been detected.

(1) Ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt and one of the most intriguing objects in the solar system, in part because of the discovery of water outgassing by the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO) and its still-debated origin. Ceres was the target of NASA's Dawn spacecraft for 3.5 yr, which achieved a detailed characterization of the dwarf planet. The possible influence of the local flux of solar energetic particles (SEP) on the production of a Cerean exosphere and water vapor has been suggested, in addition to the sublimation of water ice that depends on the temperature, meaning the heliocentric distance. Aims. We used the opportunity of both the perihelion passage of (1) Ceres in April 2018, and the presence of Dawn in its vicinity (for measuring the SEP flux in real time) to check the influence of heliocentric distance and SEP flux on water outgassing. Methods. We searched for OH emission lines near the limb of Ceres in the near-UV with the UVES spectrograph mounted on the 8-m ESO Very Large Telescope. Two spectra were recorded when Ceres was close to its perihelion, in February 2018, and with Dawn spacecraft orbiting Ceres. It was possible to simultaneously measure energetic particles around Ceres at the time of our observations. Results. Our observations did not permit detection of OH emission lines to a very high sensitivity level. This level is estimated to correspond to a global water production rate of QH2O ∼ 2 × 1026 molecules s-1, similar to the water production rate derived from HSO observations. The solar energetic particles flux measured around Ceres was negligible at the time of these observations. Conclusions. Our observations support the idea that heliocentric distance (i.e., the sublimation of water ice) does not play a major role in the water emission from Ceres. This production rate could be either related to SEP events or to other mechanisms, possibly of endogenic origin. © 2019 P.

They are persistent because of the protection by the particles and show significant toxicity to organisms. Increasing research interests have been attracted to study the potential environmental implications of EPFRs. Because of their different physical forms from conventional contaminants, it is not applicable to use the commonly used technique and strategy to predict and assess the behavior and risks of EPFRs. Current studies on EPFRs are scattered and not systematic enough to draw clear conclusions. Therefore, this review is organized to critically discuss the current research progress on EPFRs, highlighting their occurrence and transport, generation mechanisms, as well as their environmental implications (including both toxicity and reactivity). EPFR formation and stabilization as affected by the precursors and environmental factors are useful breakthrough to understand their formation mechanisms. To better understand the major differences between EPFRs and common contaminants, we identified the unique processes and/or mechanisms related to EPFRs. The knowledge gaps will be also addressed to highlight the future research while summarizing the research progress. Quantitative analysis of the interactions between organic contaminants and EPFRs will greatly improve the predictive accuracy of the multimedia environmental fate models. In addition, the health risks will be better evaluated when considering the toxicity contributed by EFPRs.

The results show that the ordinate value of the surface-shape starting point decreases when the diameter of the circular absorber increases at the same contingence angle of the proposed CPC with a circular absorber. The ordinate value of the surface-shape starting point is -29 mm when the diameter of the circular absorber is 47 mm and the contingence angle is 5.56°. Moreover, the geometric concentration ratio of this novel CPC decreases with increasing the aperture width angle. In contrast, the permissible receiving angle and the average optical efficiency increase with increasing the aperture width angle.

However, the effects of price regulation are yet unknown, especially when the world oil price fluctuates in different regimes. The study first analyses the mechanisms of petroleum product price (PPP)regulation (in the case of gasoline)and the crude oil-gasoline price fluctuation transmission, followed by the identification of regimes and their time intervals using regime-switching vector autoregressive model, and then estimates the effects of gasoline price regulation in reducing macroeconomic volatility. It is found that the world crude oil fluctuates in different regimes (the mild-fluctuation regime and the violent-fluctuation regime), the PPP regulation can reduce oil price volatility and then macroeconomic volatility, but it is more effective in the mild-fluctuation regime. The findings present a deeper understanding of the stabilization effect of PPP regulation on the macroeconomy, provide an evidence for sustaining China's PPP regulation for the purpose of macroeconomic stability, and offer policymakers new information for petroleum product pricing reforms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","43","Gasoline","Costs - Crude oil - Economics - Stabilization","Macroeconomic volatility - Oil Prices - Price regime - Price regulation - Stabilization effects","512.1 Petroleum Deposits - 523 Liquid Fuels - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 971 Social Sciences","Number: C176240202015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 71763033, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71463065 ; 71763033 ) and the Yunnan University fund for the research project of Energy Transition and Green Economic Development ( C176240202015 ).

We look at the competition between traditional retailers, who sell in a shopping mall, and e-tailers, who sell on the electronic platform. Our focus is on analyzing and demonstrating how these channel subsidies influence (1) pricing behaviors for the e-tailer and the traditional retailer and (2) consumers utilities and channel choices. The main findings are as follows. Whether from the perspective of consumers utilities or from the perspective of consumer channel choice, consumers with different WTP are influenced differently by channel subsidies. While both types of subsidy help the two channels attract some low willingness to pay consumers, the electronic channel subsidy can help the electronic channel attract consumers who are willing to pay more from the traditional channel. The results can help retailers and channel subsidy providers to understand how channel subsidies work, and the differences in the WTP of consumers who purchase products before and after subsidies. This understanding informs retailers’ segmentation, targeting and pricing decisions and helps subsidy providers to make channel subsidy-related decisions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","18","Consumer behavior","Costs - Sales - Supply chains","Channel subsidy - Consumer surplus - Consumption decision - Dual channel supply chain - Pricing decision","911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 912 Industrial Engineering and Management - 913 Production Planning and Control; Manufacturing - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The applied strain includes in-layer biaxial strain and uniaxial strain. The monolayer C3N is composed of a number of hexagonal C rings with N atoms connecting them. It is a stable indirect band gap 2D semiconductor when the strain is 0%. It could maintain indirect semiconductive character under different biaxial and uniaxial strains from = -10% to = 10%. As for its optical properties, when the uniaxial strain is applied, the absorption and reflectivity along the armchair and zigzag directions exhibit an anisotropic property. However, an isotropic property is presented when the biaxial strain is applied. Most importantly, both uniaxial tensile strain and biaxial tensile strain could cause the high absorption coefficient of monolayer C3N to be in the deep ultraviolet region.

The analysis of trace MC-LR plays important role in environmental and health fields. Herein, we developed a low-cost and enzyme-free detection method of MC-LR by using hairpin DNA-templated copper nanoclusters (hpDNA-CuNCs)as fluorescent probe. The hpDNA-template was designed and fabricated by a MC-LR aptamer loop and a double strand stem, which can specifically recognize target MC-LR with strong affinity. The AT-rich and complementary double strand stem serves as a template for the formation of CuNCs. The formed fluorescent sensing probe of hpDNA-CuNCs exhibits maximum emission wavelength at 575 nm. Upon the addition of target MC-LR into the hpDNA-CuNCs, we observed fluorescence was quenched considerably due to the high affinity between MC-LR and hpDNA aptamer strand loop, which indicated a conformational change of hairpin probe from the stem-loop DNA structure to single-stranded DNA. Then, the change of fluorescence intensity can be used to monitor the concentration of MC-LR from 0.005 to 1200 μg L−1 with a detection limit of 0.003 ng L−1.

The objective of the study is to explore whether ASCapo is stimulated by elevated O3 concentrations. The detoxification of O3 by ASCapo was quantified in tobacco (Nicotiana L), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and poplar (Populus L), which were exposed to charcoal-filtered air (CF) and elevated O3 treatments (E-O3). ASCapo in the three species were significantly increased by E-O3 compared with the values in the filtered treatment. For all three species, E-O3 significantly increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and decreased light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (Asat), suggesting that high O3 has induced injury/damage to plants. E-O3 significantly increased redox state in the apoplast (redox stateapo) for all species, whereas no effect on the apoplastic dehydroascorbate (DHAapo) was observed. In leaf tissues, E-O3 significantly enhanced reduced-ascorbate (ASC) and total ascorbate (ASC+DHA) in soybean and poplar, but significantly reduced these in tobacco, indicating different antioxidative capacity to the high O3 levels among the three species. Total antioxidant capacity in the apoplast (TACapo) was significantly increased by E-O3 in tobacco and poplar, but leaf tissue TAC was significantly enhanced only in tobacco. Leaf tissue superoxide anion (O2•-) in poplar and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tobacco and soybean were significantly increased by E-O3. The diurnal variation of ASCapo, with maximum values occurring in the late morning and lower values experienced in the afternoon, appeared to play an important role in the harmful effects of O3 on tobacco, soybean and poplar.

As the interface bonding fails, the uniform distribution of electric field will be affected, which accelerates the aging of composite insulators and affects the safe operation of transmission lines. Because of the stress between the sheath and the rod, the air gap at the interface is generally less than 10 \mu \text{m} and there is extrusion contact in some areas. Therefore, conventional nondestructive testing technology based on refraction and reflection principle cannot effectively identify the faulty insulators in the initial stage of bonding failure. Based on the constitutive model of the interface of composite insulators, the friction force of the interface after bonding failure introduces more nonlinearity in mechanical properties than hydrogen bond under well bonding condition. The numerical results show that under the influence of the nonlinear constitutive relation, the higher harmonic components in the spectrum will increase significantly. The experimental results of plate and insulator samples confirm the validity of numerical calculation.

The evolution of typical precipitates phases on the surface of silicon to each etchant were investigate before and after etching with/without MCCC via EPMA (electron probe micro analyzer) equipped with EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy).

The progress of wild edible production makes a great contribution to rural economy of Yunnan province where the yield and export volume are highest in China. Rapid authentication of wild edible fungi variety is beneficial for wild edible industry towards healthy development. Meanwhile, the authentication also contributes to the analysis of the genetic relationship between edible mushroom and their breeding. Seven kinds of fungi were collected from Yunnan and other seven origins around Yunnan. Fingerprint of caps and stipe were obtained with Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, respectively. Cap model, stipe model, low-level data fusion model and mid-level data fusion were established using prepressed spectra according to low- and mid-level fusion strategy combined with decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbor classifiers and ensemble classifiers that every model was computed 10 times. The optimal classification algorithm was selected based on the accuracy of training set. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was executed using the mid-level fusion dataset to judge genetic relationship between seven fungi. The results indicated: (1) The best algorithm of caps, stipe and low-level fusion is linear discrimination that accuracy is 92.8%, 96.4%, and 97.6%, respectively. Subspace discriminant is the most optimal in mid-level fusion that accuracy is 100%. (2) The average accuracy of all samples is 93. 61%, 95.54%, 96.99% and 99.88% based on the best model of stipe, cap, low-level data fusion and mid-level data fusion. The performance of mid-level fusion is better than other three models, which indicated that the model could distinguish the highly -similar samples by reducing the influence caused by their origins. (3) The result of HCA based on mid-level fusion dataset displayed that the distance between Boletus magnificus and B. edulis was very close, which showed their chemical information were similar and genetic relationship was close. (4) The result of HCA based on mid-level fusion dataset displayed that the distance between Boletus magnificus and Leccinum duriusculum was very long, which showed their chemical information were different and genetic relationship was inferior. In a word, mid-level data fusion strategy combining FTIR spectra of different parts, subspace discriminant and HCA could effectively distinguish different kinds of edible fungi and judge the genetic relationship, which is a novel method used for variety authentication and genetic relationship judgment of wild edible fungi. © 2019, Peking University Press.

Due to its short half-life, we used a degradable mPEG-PLA to physically encapsulate the total alkali of the lamp stage, and prepared a sustained-release microsphere by double-emulsion method. The ASAs-loaded mPEG10000-PLA microspheres were screened for better performance by testing the morphology, average particle size, embedding rate and drug loading of different molecular weight mPEG-PLA microspheres, which can stably and continuously release for 15 days at 37 °C. The results of cytotoxicity and blood compatibility indicated that the drug-loaded microspheres have beneficial biocompatibility. Animal experiments showed that the drug-loaded microspheres had a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect. These results all indicated that mPEG-PLA is a controlled release carrier material suitable for ASAs. © 2019 by the authors.","40","Controlled drug delivery","Alkaloids - Biocompatibility - Drug products - Emulsification - Metabolites - Microspheres - Particle size - Targeted drug delivery","Anti-inflammatory activity - Anti-inflammatory effects - Average particle size - Blood compatibility - Drug loaded microsphere - Drug release - MPEG-PLA - Total alkaloids from Alstonia scholaris leaves","461.9.1 Immunology - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 31460247, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81460542, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81760644, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 31460247, 81460542, 81760644), the Biodegradable Materials Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) at the University of Yunnan Province and the Innovation Team Based on Research and Application of Biological Functional Materials of Yunnan Minzu University (2017HC034), Yunnan Science and Technology Project-Major Science and Technology Specialities of Biological Medicine (2018ZF008).

It is very suitable to handle the situation that there are various possible values in membership and nonmembership degrees to depict the true circumstance. The bidirectional project method of DHPFS calculates method considered not only the bidirectional projection magnitudes and the distance but also includes angle between objects evaluated. Therefore, this paper proposes a bidirectional project method of DHPFS to handle the multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problem under the dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Through the measure between each alternative decision matrix and the positive and negative ideal alternative matrix, the ranking order all alternatives can be used to select the best alternative. Furthermore, a model for MADM has been given. Finally, a numerical example for performance assessment of new rural construction has been given to demonstrate the application of bidirectional project method of DHPFS, and we used the dual hesitant Pythagorean weighted Bonferroni mean to compare its reasonable and effectiveness. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","93","Decision making","Fuzzy sets - Membership functions - Numerical methods","Bidirectional projection - Fuzzy environments - Fuzzy multiple attribute decision making - Multiple attribute decision making - Multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems - New rural constructions - Performance assessment - Project methods","912.2 Management - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 71571128, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71571128), National Social Foundation of China (No. 17BSH125), and the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (No. 16YJA840008).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
