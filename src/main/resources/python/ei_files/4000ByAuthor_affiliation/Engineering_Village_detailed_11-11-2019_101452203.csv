Before modeling, all the sample inputs are normalized to the [0,1] range, and the mean error function is used to test the output error of the network. The commonly used RAN learning algorithm is compared with MPIRAN to verify its superiority. The simulation results show that MPIRAN learning algorithm is suitable for the classification of building materials. Compared with the other learning methods, it can also significantly reduce the number of hidden nodes in the network. Based on the above findings, it is concluded that the MPIRAN algorithm can reduce the network structure and improve the learning ability and calibration ability of the network, so that the correct classification of samples can be realized. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","10","Learning algorithms","Building materials - Environmental engineering","Building surface - Characteristic analysis - Hidden nodes - Learning abilities - Learning methods - Mean errors - Network structures - Output errors",,,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We herein report a novel strategy for preparing high-temperature Al@Al2O3 PCM. In this method, nano Ni species are loaded on the surface of Al spheres, which could accelerate the oxidation of the surface Al layer during calcination in air. By monitoring the oxygen consumption and the exothermic changes during the oxidation process, it is found that the oxidation of Al follows a stepwise process which results in the formation of a layered Al2O3 shell. The high oxygen consumption and relatively low activation energy (149-156 kJ/mol) suggests that the surface nickel species significantly accelerate the low-temperature (2O3 composites show a well-formed core-shell structure with 60-68 wt % of core fraction, high latent heat (289-312 J/g), and mitigated supercooling performance. The layered structure of the shell and the presence of voids in the core together strongly improve the elasticity of the core-shell structure by tuning the thermal stress resulting from the volumetric expansion of the Al core during melting, obtaining a very high stability in long-term melting-freezing cycles. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.","53","Phase change materials","Activation energy - Alumina - Aluminum - Aluminum oxide - Encapsulation - Heat storage - High temperature corrosion - Latent heat - Melting - Oxidation - Oxygen - Shells (structures) - Temperature - Thermal expansion - Thermal stress","Core shell structure - Encapsulated phase change materials - High temperature thermal energy storages - Layered Structures - Low-activation energy - Oxygen consumption - Surface nickel species - Volumetric expansion",,"Number: 2014HB006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 51774159, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51774159 and 51604137), the Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province (2014HB006), the Qinglan Project of Kunming University of Science and Technology, and China Scholarship Council (the International Clean Energy Talent Program, 2017).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The suboptimality of the proposed utilization-based test is evaluated via a widely-used scheduling metric, speedup factors. The second test is a more effective test but with higher complexity which is based on the concept of demand bound function (DBF). The proposed DBF-based test is more generic and can apply to constrained deadline IMC task set. Moreover, in order to address the high time cost of the existing deadline tuning algorithm, we propose a novel algorithm which significantly improve the efficiency of the deadline tuning procedure.

However, the safety and efficacy of this gene-editing technique are significant issues. Recent reports on mouse models and human cells have raised concerns that off-target mutations could hamper applying the CRISPR technology in patients. The high similarities of nonhuman primates to humans in genome content and organization, genetic diversity, physiology, and cognitive abilities have made these animals ideal experimental models for understanding human diseases and developing therapeutics. Off-target mutations of CRISPR/Cas9 have been analyzed in previous studies of nonhuman primates, but no report has investigated genome-wide off-target effects in living monkeys. Here, we used rhesus monkeys in which a genetic disorder mimicking Duchenne muscular dystrophy had previously been produced with CRISPR/ Cas9. Using whole-genome sequencing to comprehensively assess on- and off-target mutations in these animals, we found that CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing is active on the expected genomic sites without producing off-target modifications in other functional regions of the genome. These findings suggest that the CRISPR/Cas9 technique could be relatively safe and effective in modeling genetic disease in nonhuman primates and in future therapeutic research of human diseases. © 2018 Wang et al.","14","Genes","Clinical research - Mammals - Psychophysiology","Biomedical research - Clinical application - Duchenne muscular dystrophies - Experimental models - Muscular dystrophy - Target modification - Therapeutic research - Whole genome sequencing","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering","Number: 2016YFA010401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018YFA0107902, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015FA037, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: U1602224, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Pro-gram of China Grants 2018YFA0107902 and 2016YFA010401, National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant U1602224, and Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province Grant 2015FA037.

Existing information retrieval-based change impact analysis methods select a single method to transform the source code corpus into vectors in a process known as indexing. The single method is chosen from two primary methods, known as the bag-of-words and word embedding models, each having their specific advantages and disadvantages. The bag-of-words model records every word in the source code but ignores contextual information in the corpus. The word embedding model records the contextual information but loses detail for individual words. To address this problem, we propose a structure-driven method for information retrieval-based change impact analysis (named SDM-CIA). SDM-CIA integrates the bag-of-words and word embedding models based on the software's structure. Our experiments using a standard benchmark shows that when compared with the existing methods, SDM-CIA improves on precision performance, recall performance, F-score performance, and MRR performance by an average of 3.65%, 3.82%, 3.6%, and 10.28%, respectively.

In this study, shikimic, gallic, fumaric, ferulic, vanillic acid and quercetin in root exudates of Abelmoschus esculentus act as chemoattractants of endophytic Alcaligenes faecalis strains, BHU 12, BHU 16 and BHU M7. In vitro chemotaxis assay showed that BHU 12 expressed highest chemotactic movement (CFU ∼50 × 1012) towards A.esculentus root exudates followed by BHU 16 and BHU M7 (CFU∼ 9 × 1012), thereby confirming their ability to colonize the host rhizoplane region. However, BHU 16 expressed highest biofilm formation ability followed by BHU 12 and BHU M7. Assessment of chemotactic and biofilm formation potential towards individual phenolic acids revealed BHU 12 to be maximally attracted towards 1 μM shikimic acid (2 × 1015) while BHU 16 towards 1 mM vanillic acid (6.5 × 1012) and BHU M7 towards 1 mM ferulic acid (3.5 × 1012), thereby confirming the phenolic acid components responsible for particularly attracting the endophytic isolates. Upon colonization, the endophytic isolates modified the phenolic profiles of root exudates in planta in a manner so as to plausibly attract more of the beneficial rhizospheric microbiota as well as self-fortification against pathogenic microbes. This hypothesis was verified by monitoring the changes in phenolic components of A. esculentus root exudate owing to S. rolfsii infection, a disastrous soil-borne pathogen. Thus, on the whole, the work provides intricate details of plant-endophyte interactions for biotic stress management through careful manipulation of root exudates, thereby aiding in sustainable agriculture. © 2017","52","Bacteria","Agriculture - Biochemistry - Biofilms - Organic acids - Soils","Abelmoschus esculentus - Alcaligenes faecalis - Endophytic bacteria - Phenolics - Root exudates - Sclerotium rolfsii","462.5 Biomaterials (including synthetics) - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control","Number: -, Acronym: BHU, Sponsor: Banaras Hindu University; ","SR and KB are grateful to Banaras Hindu University for providing financial assistance in form of UGC-RET fellowship.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It demands that the ontology algorithm must be more efficient than before. In a specific engineering application, the ontology algorithm is required to find in a quick way the semantic matching set of the concept and rank it back to the user according to their similarities. Therefore, to use learning tricks to get better ontology algorithms is an open problem nowadays.

Although various aspects of biodrying have been studied, emission gas released from biodrying has rarely been characterized or treated. In this study, water vapors in emission gas were condensed by chilling and gaseous substances were further trapped in successive acid/alkali solutions. Mass balance analyses showed that water, C, and N removed from sludge by biodrying were completely recovered in the emission gas condensate (EGC), which contained 1,485.2 mg/L of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 16,500 mg/L of total nitrogen (TN, mostly ammonia nitrogen, NH3-N), and 662.7 mg/L of total organic carbon (TOC). 22 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in EGC. Acid-trap solution contained a high concentration of NH3-N (16,472.0 mg/L) and a moderate concentration of TOC (281.3 mg/L). Alkali-trap solution contained 22,676.7 mg/L of total inorganic carbon (TIC), but concentrations of other pollutants were low. Chlorination was demonstrated to be the best treatment method for EGC due to high removal ratios of TN, NH3-N, COD, and TOC at an optimized Cl:N mass ratio of 12.8:1. Since TIC was predominantly dissolved CO2, only the mixture of EGC and acid-trap solution was chlorinated at this ratio, and residual concentrations of NH3-N, TN, and TOC were 1.3, 163.3, and 62.0 mg/L with removal ratios of almost 100%, 99.0%, and 85.8%, respectively.

The influencing factors, absorption isotherms, kinetics, and mechanism were investigated. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization and elemental analysis of PMBY showed that phosphate groups were successfully grafted onto the surface of yeast. The kinetic studies suggested that the adsorption process followed a pseudo-second-order chemisorption. The adsorption process of Pb2+using PMBY was spontaneous and endothermic. Furthermore, the adsorption of Pb2+on PMBY can rapidly achieve adsorption equilibrium (in just 3 min), and the maximum adsorption capacity of Pb2+on PMBY was found to be 92 mg g-1at 30 °C, which was about 3 times that of the pristine baker's yeast. The suggested mechanism for Pb2+adsorption on PMBY was based upon ion-exchange, electrostatic interaction and chelation between the phosphate groups and Pb2+. However, compared with the pristine baker's yeast, the higher capacity and rapid adsorption of PMBY for Pb2+was mainly due to the chelation and electrostatic interactions between the phosphate groups and Pb2+. In addition, the regeneration experiments indicated that the PMBY was easily recovered through desorption in 0.01 M HCl, and that PMBY still exhibited 90.77% of the original adsorption capacity for Pb2+after five regeneration cycles. These results showed the excellent regeneration capability of PMBY for Pb2+adsorption.

A goal-oriented modeling and reasoning method for trustworthiness requirements to find the crosscutting activities that satisfy multiple trustworthiness requirements is presented. Then, base processes are modeled for functional requirements. The crosscutting activities for trustworthiness requirements are decomposed into processes or tasks and encapsulated in aspects that are woven into the base processes. In the weaving procedure, correct weaving methods between multiple aspects and between aspects and base processes are designed. Errors or mistakes of aspect-oriented process modeling are prevented.

Here, Tb3+-doped glass ceramics (GC) with crystallized Lu6O5F8nano-crystals were prepared and characterized as potential X-ray scintillators. Their structural, optical, and luminescent properties were explored systematically. After thermal treatment, X-ray excited luminescence (XEL) intensity from Lu6O5F8:Tb3+GC is greatly increased and the relative intensity is about 64% of commercial BGO scintillator, benefiting from preferential enrichment of Tb3+ions into Lu6O5F8nano-crystals with low phonon energy. Moreover, unusual decay behaviors of Tb3+emissions in GC sample are observed and discussed. Our results indicate that rare earth doped GC may offer a novel platform for designing and fabricating new scintillating materials in the future. © 2017 The American Ceramic Society","28","X rays","Glass ceramics - Ionization - Luminescence - Lutetium compounds - Phosphors - Rare earths - Scintillation - Scintillation counters - Terbium compounds","BGO-scintillators - Diverse applications - Low phonon energies - Lu6O5F8 - Luminescent property - Relative intensity - Transparent glass ceramics - X ray excited luminescence","741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 944.7 Radiation Measuring Instruments","Number: 20152ACB21017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Number: 11374269, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11165010, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 20152ACB21017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Number: 11374269, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11165010, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 11374269, 11165010; Natural Science Fund of Jiangxi Province, Grant/Award Number: 20152ACB21017",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It is applied for packaging substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filter to avoid interference and losses induced by external radiation emission and internal radiation leakage. The middle layer substrate generates a gap layer. In the base/bottom layer, cascaded resonators of the SIW filters are formed by properly etching slots on the metal plane and placing plated vias in the middle of this layer. The higher-order modes of TE103 and TE104 are suppressed using slots designed in the base layer at the third-order cavity, which leads to wide stopband.

This paper proposes a projection approach based on Petri nets, which allows us to 1) generate the peers defined by interaction Petri nets with τ through action projection from a choreography defined by an interaction Petri net, 2) develop four types of tau deletion rules to selectively delete τ of interaction Petri nets, and 3) specify the behavior consistency between choreography and the generated peers to check whether two Petri nets meet the weak simulation. Moreover, the correctness of these four types of tau deletion rules is proved.

We synthesized Au@Pt NPs whose shell (Pt layer) thickness can be varied by changing the molar ratio of Au/Pt, and then assembled these Au@PtNPs onto thiol (-SH)-functionalized MWCNTs surfaces to form a series of Au@Pt/MWCNTs composites. The surface chemical state, structure, and morphology of the Au@Pt NPs and Au@Pt/MWCNTs composites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical tests including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were conducted to determine the assembly quality of Au@Pt NPs differing in shell thickness, and to characterize the activity of Au@Pt/MWCNTs catalysts. The results confirmed the successful assembly of Au@Pt NPs on MWCNTs surfaces via the covalent Pt-S/Au-S bonds formed between the monometallic Au or Pt of Au@Pt NPs and the thiol group of MWCNTs. The dispersion of Au@Pt NPs on MWCNTs highly depends on the atom ratios of Au/Pt. When the Pt envelopes outside the Au cores are incomplete, the exposed Au atoms facilitate the assembly of Au@Pt NPs. And on the contrary, if the Au cores are entirely coated by the Pt shell, the oxidation state Pt() on the Au@Pt NPs surfaces will exert a negative effect. In particular, an 1:1 atomic ratio of Au/Pt can result in the satisfactory dispersion of Au@Pt NPs on MWCNTs, also a distinctly higher activity and better stability of Au@Pt/MWCNTs (1:1) compared with Pt/MWCNTs toward electrocatalytic methanol oxidation in alkaline media. © 2018, Materials Review Magazine.

This model includes two types of electrode material erosion: vaporization and sputter erosion. A two-dimensional magnetic hydrodynamics (MHD) model is built. In this model, the molten pool and arc are combined together. And the energy balance on the interface between electrode and arc is considered. The erosion model is established on the basis of the molten pool model. The vaporization flux caused by concentration gradient is calculated using the Langmuir formula when the surface temperature of molten pool is lower than its boiling point. The vaporization rate caused by pressure gradient is bigger than it caused by concentration gradient. The vaporization rate caused by pressure gradient is calculated by the fundamental principles of gas dynamics. The sputter rate is obtained based on statistical methods. The influence of electrode gap on the erosion is also carried out.

The effects of multiplicative noise intensity, additive noise intensity, cross-correlation noise intensity and time delay on SNR are discussed by numerical calculation and graphical analysis. The results indicate that when the SNR is a function of multiplicative noise intensity, the peak value of the SNR rises as time delay increases; when SNR is a function of additive noise intensity, the value of SNR ascends as time delay increases; when SNR is a function of cross-correlation noise intensity, the peak value of SNR goes up with time delay increased.

Its characteristic is regarded as a discontinuous medium, whereas the characteristic of the soil behind the wall is a typical continuous medium. In this paper, the ultimate bearing capacity of masonry retaining wall was studied by combining the lower bound theory, the mixed numerical discretisation and linear programming. Firstly, soil mass was discretised by triangular finite elements to simulate its continuum mechanics characteristics, while the masonry wall was discretised by rigid block elements to simulate its non-continuum mechanics characteristics. Thus, constraint conditions of the statically admissible stress field were both proposed for soil and the masonry retaining wall. Meanwhile, constraint conditions were also proposed for interfaces between finite elements and block elements. By considering the overload coefficient as the objective function, the linear programming model was established for calculating the ultimate bearing capacity of masonry retaining wall. In addition, the interior point algorithm was employed to solve the problems of linear mathematical programming. At last, the ultimate load (or safety factor) of slope and its corresponding stress field were obtained directly. Moreover, three typical examples were conducted to validate the proposed method. Therefore, this study successfully introduced the mixed numerical discretisation into the limit analysis. © 2018, Science Press.

According to the significant difference between wind speed and power curves in different wind turbine sets, the spatial effect is considered using the random sampling comparison method. In order to highlight the influence of spatial effect on the output power of wind farm, a simulation model consisting 20 wind turbines on the MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform is built. The result shows that the spatial effect cannot be neglected if the dynamic equivalent models of large-scale wind farm need a higher accuracy. In the actual wind farm, the measured wind speed and power data have to be taken into account the influence of the spatial effect. Therefore, the measured data of a wind farm is used as the clustering index according to K-means clustering analysis method. In an actual wind farm, 33 sets of UP77-1.5 MW wind turbines are grouped into 4 clusters. Each wind turbine set corresponds to an equivalent model, and takes into account the spatial effects of the sets. Finally, according to the comparison and error analysis of each model and the measured data, the rationality and correctness of the dynamic equivalent model proposed in this paper are verified.

However, all existing compressive tracking were based on compressed Haar-like feature, and how to compress many more excellent high-dimensional features is worth researching. In this paper, a novel compressed normalized block difference feature (CNBD) was proposed. For resisting noise effectively in a highdimensional normalized pixel difference feature (NPD), a normalized block difference feature extends two pixels in the original formula of NPD to two blocks. A CNBD feature can be obtained by compressing a normalized block difference feature based on compressive sensing theory, with the sparse random Gaussian matrix as the measurement matrix. The comparative experiments of 7 trackers on 20 challenging sequences showed that the tracker based on CNBD feature can perform better than other trackers, especially than FCT tracker based on compressed Haar-like feature, in terms of AUC, SR and Precision. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","15","Tracking (position)","Compressed sensing - Computer vision - Extraction - Feature extraction - Pixels - Product development","CNBD - Comparative experiments - Compressed Normalized Block Difference - Compressive sensing - Haar-like features - High dimensional feature - Object Tracking - Real time tracking","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 913.6 Product Development; Concurrent Engineering","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2016FB103, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61262067, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11663007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work is supported by Application Foundation Project of Yunnan Province of China (Grant No.: 2016FB103), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 61262067 and 11663007).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The model uses both RF/IF signals and baseband envelopes, resulting in the short-term and long-term memory effect mitigated efficiently even for high signal bandwidth. The model complexity is lower than the existing baseband DPDs and does not increase with the increase of the signal bands. The model is experimentally evaluated in three scenarios: two 20 MHz long-term evolution (LTE) signals spaced by 100 and 40 MHz, and three 20 MHz LTE signals spaced by 50 MHz.

What ensemble members we proposed in this study comprises of Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel, Support Vector Machine with linear kernel and Neural Network(NN). We chose these ensemble members for their different pros and cons of performance on membrane protein types prediction. Then we used logarithmic weighting to combine them and got the final prediction model. Experiments were carried out on benchmark dataset that contains a training set, a hold-out cross-validation set, and a test set.

To analyze NPP spatial-temporal variation within the context of changes in hydrothermal conditions, the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) is used to elucidate the mathematical relationship between NPP and hydrothermal conditions. Based on this spatial-temporal pattern of NPP and hydrothermal conditions in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, regression statistics, an empirical model of land evaporation, and the water and thermal product index (K) are used to evaluate correlations between NPP and hydrothermal conditions in terms of their distribution pattern and interaction. The results show the following. (1) From 2000 to 2014, NPP in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin was highest in the central region and gradually decreased toward the southwest and northwest, whereas the annual change rate in NPP showed no significant increasing trend. (2) In the Lancang Basin, the correlation between hydrothermal conditions and NPP was high with respect to their distribution patterns, though this correlation was low in the Mekong Basin. (3) Correlation between K and NPP is high in the region where the effects of water and thermal factors on vegetation growth are similar. (4) K is an effective complement to the correlation between a single hydrothermal factor (temperature or precipitation) and NPP, and the influence of hydrothermal conditions on NPP was positive in the Lancang River and negative in the Mekong River Basin.

This work builds on an earlier study where the CNFs were prepared from a waste biomass (walnut shells) using a relatively simple procedure of liquefying the biomass, and electrospinning and carbonizing the fibrils. We further improved the mass ratio of the liquefying process and investigated the effects of the high temperature carbonization process at 1000, 1500 and 2000 °C, and comprehensively characterized the morphology, structural properties, and specific surface area of walnut shell-derived CNFs; and their electrochemical performance was also investigated as electrode materials in Li-ion batteries. Results demonstrated that the CNF anode obtained at 1000 °C exhibits a high specific capacity up to 271.7 mA h g-1at 30 mA g-1, good rate capacity (131.3 and 102.2 mA h g-1at 1 A g-1and 2 A g-1, respectively), and excellent cycling performance (above 200 mA h g-1specific capacity without any capacity decay after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1).

A distinct reduction of band gap energy is being a result of HNT doping which leads to the formation of charge transfer complexes (CTC) and π-conjugation between HNT and PC matrix. Further absorption bands and absorption edge parameters such as Urbach energy (Eu) and energy gap (Eg) are used to evaluate the changes in the NC films. The structural and morphological aspects of PC/HNT NC were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction studies and scanning electron microscopy.

Extracting the region tectonic landforms information from the RS (remote sensing) images and DEM (digital elevation model) to quantitative study of tectonic geomorphology of the fault zone. The results show that the fault belt have the characteristics of segmented partitions. The northern boundary faults of the Jinguan-Chenghai basin are dominated by normal faults, and they have the highest vertical movement rate in the zone. Qina faults are dominated by strike-slip movement, which have the highest strike-slip activity rate. The eastern boundary faults in Binchuan basin are also dominated by normal faults. The vertical activity rate is lower than that of the northern section. Comprehensive analysis shows that the Quaternary vertical activity of Chenghai-Binchuan fault zone is lower from north to south, and strike-slip activity in central is strongest, diminishing to south. The long-term activity rate of Binchuan fault zone has maintained a relatively stable state, the vertical activity rates between 0.09-0.69 mm/a. Horizontal strike-slip rate between 0.20-1.40 mm/a.

The Ensem-NN is introduced based on the idea of ensemble learning, 'two heads are better than one.' According to the property of skeleton sequences, we design one-dimensional convolution neural network with residual structure as Base-Net. From entirety to local, from focus to motion, we designed four different subnets based on the Base-Net to extract diverse features. The first subnet is a Two-stream Entirety Net , which performs on the entirety skeleton and explores both temporal and spatial features. The second is a Body-part Net, which can extract fine-grained spatial and temporal features. The third is an Attention Net, in which a channel-wised attention mechanism can learn important frames and feature channels. Frame-difference Net, as the fourth subnet, aims at exploring motion features. Finally, the four subnets are fused as one ensemble network.

In recent years, with the introduction of new national policies and people's increasing awareness of environmental protection, haze has received widespread social attention. Haze pollution in China has always been a prominent environmental problem. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of haze pollution is PM2.5, which not only occurs in cities with high degree of industrialization or urbanization, but also often appear in regions with good air quality. This paper selects eight main cities in Yunnan Province as the research area, and uses the measured PM2.5 data from eight main cities in January 2015 to February 2018 in Yunnan Province as the basic data, using the eight urban meteorological data as the basic data, using the MK trend test and Correlation coefficient method to carry out research on the spatial-temporal variation and correlation of PM2.5 in the last three years in Yunnan Province. The space-time analysis shows that the average annual PM2.5 concentration in Lijiang City is the lowest, the monthly average concentration in Baoshan City is the highest, and the daily average concentration in Puer City is in a gentle trend; Except for Lijiang, the other seven cities all experienced different levels of pollution from March 17 to March 26, 2015; The concentration of PM2.5 in each city showed a seasonal pattern of 'U' and a pulse-like diurnal variation pattern in winter and spring, summer and autumn; cities with higher annual average concentrations in the province are concentrated in the northeast and southwest. Correlation analysis showed that PM2.5 concentration was significantly negatively correlated with precipitation and wind speed, and negatively correlated with daily average humidity and temperature. © 2018 IEEE.","22","Environmental protection","Air quality - Climate change - Correlation methods - Wind","Annual average concentration - Correlation coefficient method - Ecological environments - Haze pollutions - Humidity and temperatures - PM2.5 - Temporal and spatial variation - Trend tests","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2012AA121402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FD020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41761084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2012AA121402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FD020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41761084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41761084), China High Technology Research and Development Program 863 (2012AA121402), and Yunnan Natural Science Foundation of China (2016FD020).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

As such, their tolerance toward SOMs has rarely been questioned. Unexpectedly, we found that SOMs can greatly suppress the ORR activity of microporous-type Fe/N/C catalysts in alkaline medium. Such a suppression effect is strengthened as molecular polarity decreases or molecular weight increases and can be attributed to the blockage of micropore transport channels for ORR-related species by SOM adsorption. Interestingly, such a suppression effect by micropore filling disappears in the acidic medium. High tolerance to SOMs in acidic medium is attributed to the protonation of pyridinic-N, which increases the polarity of the micropore surrounding and inhibits the adsorption of low-polarity SOMs. This study is helpful to guide the synthesis of porous Fe/N/C electrocatalysts, especially when they are applied in an alkaline medium. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","33",,,,,"Number: 2016YFB0101202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 91645121, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21621091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by grants from National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB0101202) and NSFC (91645121 and 21621091).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

N-CQDs were prepared via microwave route by using urea and citric acid as raw materials. Two kinds of macrocyclic hosts, β-CD and WP6, were incorporated on to the N-CQDs via hydrogen bonding and π − π interactions, respectively. The FTIR, TGA, and XPS characterizitions demonstrated that the β-CD-N-CQD and WP6-N-CQD composites were successfully prepared. The WP6-N-CQD-modified glass carbon electrode (GCE) indicated an enhanced electrochemical signal than the β-CD-N-CQDs/GCE in the reduction of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), which was attributed to the higher supramolecular recognition capability of the WP6 host than that of β-CD towards TNT. The linear ranges of 0.001 μM–1.0 μM and 1.0 μM–20.0 μM were obtained by using this electrochemical sensing platform. The detection limit was 0.95 nM (S/N = 3).

The optimum leaching conditions, leading to 75.48% of total REE leaching efficiency, required a stirring speed of 500 rpm, a leaching time of 30 min, a lixiviant concentration of 3 wt.% and a liquid:solid ratio of 3:1. After extension of the leaching process by a second stage, the leaching efficiency may reach up to 96.19%, which is slightly higher than that obtained by (NH4)2SO4. Leaching varies from element to element, with Ce presenting the lowest leaching efficiency, and the partition in leaching solution is in agreement with that in raw ore other than for Ce.

Then, we propose a weighted average based on a time-varying Markov model to increase the estimation accuracy of the EIKF. In this way, a kind of fast SLAM algorithm is designed through combinatorial synthetic integration, in which the IBPF algorithm is employed to realize simultaneous localization and the EIKF is utilized to build a map.

The Strahler hypsometric values of the whole area (catchment), elevation zones' terrains and their depressions are measured. Supported by Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies, these Strahler hypsometric measurements are designed based on the development mechanism of karst landform, which includes height-reduction horizontal erosions and depth-increase vertical erosions. The results indicate that landscapes with different development features on various topographic surfaces have different Strahler values. The differences and patterns could be used as an indicator to reflect the evolution of landscapes. Shilin county's geomorphic structure has four levels of terrains with different altitudes at the late period of mature stage. Such a structure is formed from the decomposition of the monadnock karst planation plateau with an interplay of the faults and the erosion base of Bajiang river. Shilin county has a rejuvenating geomorphic structure, which is heterogeneous from other geomorphic structures of the same stage. The terrain above 2100 metres of altitude is the structural erosion karst plateau middle mountain evolved from the monadnock karst planation plateau with less depressions. The terrain with an altitude of 1900-2100 metres shifts from the monadnock karst planation into the monadnock karst plateau depressions and cone karst depressions with less underground rivers. The elevation zone with an altitude of 1700-1900 metres is a karst hill slope. The zone is composed of the vertical layer structure of the Stone Forest and the horizontal terrace geomorphic structure. The vertical layer structure of the Stone Forest comprises stone forest remains, pinnacle-shaped stone forest, buried stone forest, and baked stone forest. The horizontal terrace geomorphic structure contains karst hills, stone forest, karst depressions, underground rivers, karst springs, and Bajiang river-basin. The landform is shaped from the mixed functions of vertical and horizontal karst processes, with water resources produced and water-soil eroded off.

Based on changeable carbon structure, these functional groups of organic compounds combine with each other via molecular forces, covalent bonding and miscellaneous vacancy filling. SEM results show that the compounds adhere to carbon holes, losing adsorption capacity, causing the devitalization of spent carbon. Through the analysis of dielectric properties using cavity perturbation technique, microwave-adsorbing capacity of spent carbon is related to cavity perturbation frequency, temperature and molecular structure of the organic compounds. High-performance regeneration of spent carbon could be conducted under best frequency and temperature conditions with microwave-assisted. Ultrasound technique is the necessary regeneration step that provides energy to break bonds between the carbon structure and the organic compounds.

The envelopes of fundamental and second harmonic signals are separated from the whole echoed RF signals using Butterworth high-pass filter. Then the Nakagami distribution parameters of the envelope signals are calculated and compared. The simulation results show that for different values of the nonlinear coefficients, the values of distribution parameters of the fundamental envelope signals are aliasing. On the contrary, the parameter values of second harmonic are mutually separating, especially for the nonlinear coefficients ranged from 3 to 6. In vitro experiments, compared with fat tissue, the relative differences of Nakagami parameter ω and μ of the fundamental envelope signals for liver and brain tissue are 7.3%, 0.03% and 2.0%, 4.3%, respectively; however the relative differences of 2nd harmonic envelope signals are 8.3%, 19.4% and 7.0%, 34.0%, respectively. The results of vitro experiments verify the effectiveness and correctness of the simulation results.

The southwestern province of Yunnan is among the provinces piloting the current iteration of power market reforms. As such, lessons from Yunnan will inform future market reform and renewable energy policies in China and potentially elsewhere. The dominance of hydropower in Yunnan's energy portfolio and the particular transmission constraints it faces, offer an interesting case study of the challenges of decarbonization. We report on market architecture reforms and aggregate market data collected from the Yunnan Power Exchange. We review four elements in the reformed market architecture. Market pricing rules, transitional quantity controls, the generation rights market, and inter-provincial trade. The specifics of market reform reflect a compromise between decarbonization, inter-provincial competition, grid security and development objectives and contribute to understanding of how the dual transitions of hydropower decarbonization and market liberalization interact.

This study presented a geostatistical downscaling-calibration procedure to derive the high spatial resolution maps of precipitation over a mountainous watershed affected by a monsoon climate. Based on the relationships between precipitation and other environmental variables, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM), a regression model with a residual correction method was applied to downscale the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product from coarse resolution (25 km) to fine resolution (1 km). Two methods, geographical difference analysis (GDA) and geographical ratio analysis (GRA), were used to calibrate the downscaled TRMM precipitation data. Monthly 1 km precipitation data were obtained by disaggregating 1 km annual downscaled and calibrated precipitation data using monthly fractions derived from original TRMM data. The downscaled precipitation datasets were validated against ground observations measured by rain gauges. According to the comparison of different regression models and residual interpolation methods, a geographically-weighted regression kriging (GWRK) method was accepted to conduct the downscaling of TRMM data. The downscaled TRMM precipitation data obtained using GWRK described the spatial patterns of precipitation reasonably well at a spatial resolution of 1 km with more detailed information when compared with the original TRMM precipitation. The results of validation indicated that the GRA method provided results with higher accuracy than that of the GDA method. The final annual and monthly downscaled precipitation not only had significant improvement in spatial resolution, but also agreed well with data from the validation rain gauge stations (i.e., R2= 0.72, RMSE = 161.0 mm, MAE = 127.5 mm, and Bias = 0.050 for annual downscaled precipitation during 2001 to 2015; and R2= 0.91, RMSE = 22.2 mm, MAE = 13.5 mm, and Bias = 0.048 for monthly downscaled precipitation during 2001 to 2015). In general, the downscaling-calibration procedure is useful for complex mountainous areas with insufficient ground gauges.","92","Rain","Calibration - Image resolution - Interpolation - Precipitation (chemical) - Rain gages - Regression analysis - Surveying - Watersheds","China - Complex mountainous areas - Down-scaling - Geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK) - Normalized difference vegetation index - Red River basin - TRMM 3B43 - Tropical rainfall measuring missions","405.3 Surveying - 443.2 Meteorological Instrumentation - 443.3 Precipitation - 444.1 Surface Water - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2017FB071, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016YFA0601601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Acknowledgments: This work was funded by the National Key R & D Program of China (grant 2016YFA0601601) and Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Province (grant 2017FB071).

However, the phylogeographic structure and domestication knowledge of this crop remains poorly understood. In this study, sequence variations of five chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions were investigated to address these questions. For the 645 individuals from 52 Cannabis accessions sampled (25 wild populations and 27 domesticated populations or cultivars), three haplogroups (Haplogroup H, M, L) were identified and these lineages exhibited distinct high-middle-low latitudinal gradients distribution pattern. This pattern can most likely be explained as a consequence of climatic heterogeneity and geographical isolation. Therefore, we examined the correlations between genetic distances and geographical distances, and tested whether the climatic factors are correlated with the cpDNA haplogroup frequencies of populations. The “isolation-by-distance” models were detected for the phylogeographic structure, and the day-length was found to be the most important factor (among 20 BioClim factors) that influenced the population structures. Considering the distinctive phylogeographic structures and no reproductive isolation among members of these lineages, we recommend that Cannabis be recognized as a monotypic genus typified by Cannabis sativa L., containing three subspecies: subsp. sativa, subsp. Indica, and subsp. ruderalis. Within each haplogroup which possesses a relatively independent distribution region, the wild and domesticated populations shared the most common haplotypes, indicating that there are multiregional origins for the domesticated crop. Contrast to the prevalent Central-Asia-Origin hypothesis of C. saltiva, molecular evidence reveals for the first time that the low latitude haplogroup (Haplogroup L) is the earliest divergent lineage, implying that Cannabis is probably originated in low latitude region. © 2018 Zhang, Chen, Guo, Trindade, Salentijn, Guo, Guo, Xu and Yang.","64","Population distribution","Crops - Hemp - Plants (botany)","Cannabaceae - CpDNA - Genetic diversity - Industrial hemp - Phylogeography","405.3 Surveying - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 31360350, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: CAR-16-E07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Agriculture Research System of China; ","The authors are very grateful to Dr. Zai-Wei Ge and Bang Feng from Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for helping in dating analyses.

By analyzing the writing methods and habits, a novel algorithm is given based on the chain-connected domain algorithm. It is called connected domain priority marking algorithm, which can be used for both contour tracking and glyphic skeletons partition. Experiments show that the algorithm can extract the correct and ordered contour for the contour-based single graphemes, and solve the problem of sequential extraction of the strokes which are composed of single pixels. For the structure-based single graphemes, the algorithm can achieve the ordered and partitioned skeletons of graphemes by their connected domain, and ensure that the partition results are local consistency for glyphs with the same or similar structure. Therefore, the connected domain priority marking algorithm not only provides a convenient way to analyze the basic structure of Dongba hieroglyphs, but also provides an efficient tool for retrieving isomorphic/variant elements, deformed glyphs, and suffixes of the same basic elements, and lay a foundation for the study of Dongba hieroglyphic structure, glyphs creation, classification detection and reorganization. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd., 2018.","13","Contour measurement","Musculoskeletal system","Basic structure - Connected domains - Contour tracking - Dongba hieroglyph - Local consistency - Marking algorithm - Sequential extraction - Structure-based","461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The study of spatial influence is a concrete description and analysis of spatial interaction problems in the study of geography and regional economics, and it also summarizes analytical methods for spatial influence. According to the Tobler's First Law of Geography, the spatial interaction is affected by distance. Therefore, based on the Gravity Model, this paper discusses the distance decay function to analyze the situation and change of interaction strength between objects under the influence of distance. The field spread model is used to analyze the spatial attractiveness and radiation force of the city. The Breakpoint Theory reflects the specific strength of the intercity connections, especially the attraction of surrounding cities at the Breaking Point.

Adoption of a reasonable strength criterion facilitates the prediction accuracy of borehole stability and reduces the chance of borehole breakout. Since the widely-used Hoek-Brown strength criterion neglects the effect of intermediate principal stress, the potential of rock strength cannot be fully realized. To solve the above problems, a newly proposed modified Hoek-Brown strength criterion that overcomes the shortcomings of singularity and non-convexity that exist in most classic strength criteria, is used for the stability analysis of horizontal, vertical, and inclined borehole, respectively. By calculating the minimum mud pressure required for ensuring borehole stability, comparisons with several classic strength criteria such as Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager, Hoek-Brown, 3D Hoek-Brown, Mogi-Coulomb, and modified Lade strength criterion are conducted, coming to the following conclusions: the predicted results of the adopted modified Hoek-Brown strength criterion are close to those predicted by 3D Hoek-Brown, Mogi-Coulomb, and the modified Lade strength criterion; the relative error between the predicted value and the mud value used in two actual projects are 2.1% and 0.76%, respectively; those results prove the accuracy of the modified Hoek-Brown criterion for borehole stability analysis; the minimum mud pressure increase linearly with increasing borehole depth; meanwhile, it is affected by the inclination angle and the azimuth angle of the borehole; both Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown criteria are conservative in predicting the minimum mud pressure, increasing the amount of mud that actually used; and the Drucker-Prager criterion over-predicts the rock strength, bringing about an unsafe predictive value of minimum mud pressure; base on the modified Hoek-Brown criterion, the theoretically optimal drilling position can be obtained (i.e. the minimum required mud pressure value), which provides a useful reference for the drilling engineer to optimize the position of borehole. © 2018, Science Press.

The results show that, when the spacing bar are arranged in staggered style, the fluids in the low-velocity regions would flow into high-velocity regions because of the viscous force and the region near the spacing bar are easier to form eddies which enhance the interactions of the fluid in adjacent tube layer. The local details of temperature and flow field suggest that the staggered arrangement could strengthen both disturbance of the velocity field and heat transfer in the shell side. To evaluate the performance of the different arrangements of spacing bar, the TEFs (thermal performance factors) are calculated and the values indicate that the staggered arrangement of spacing bar has positive impact on the performance of SWHEs.

The as-synthesized products were characterized using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that TiO2was in the anatase phase in the as-synthesized PF/TiO2product and the crystallite size was smaller than that for TiO2. The coupling of PF increased the light absorption capacity of TiO2. Under irradiation with natural sunlight, TiO2(500 °C, 2 h) obtained a phenol degradation rate of 28.9% after 7.5 h whereas 4% PF/TiO2(200 °C, 2 h) degraded phenol more efficiently (62.8%) in the same time according to high performance liquid chromatography. The higher photocatalytic activity of 4% PF/TiO2(200 °C, 2 h) can be attributed to a combination of factors, including graphite carbon material formation, a smaller crystallite size, and stronger optical absorption in the visible region.

There were four types of samples taken from the Chengdu-Lanzhou railway. The results showed that the samples generally expanded before the peak stress reached, and the dilatation behaviour was influenced by the loading azimuth and degree of anisotropy. The vertical strain rate was greater than the horizontal one before the dilatation occurred, and vice versa after expansion. When the volumetric strain of phyllite samples converted from a positive value to a negative one, three conditions existed: pre-peak stress, post-peak stress and not-converted. Besides, the probability of the conversion was related to the participation degree, the form, and the failure mode of the original cracks during the loading process. The maximum dilatation rate appeared at the moment when the axial strain reached its maximum value, and the high azimuth angle was more sensitive to the dilatation capacity. The initiation stress of the dilatation was usually low, and the difference between the loading azimuth and lithology was large. The deformation and failure process of phyllite under loading was significantly reflected by the elastic modulus and Poisson ratio which were greatly affected by the dilatancy. © 2018, Science Press.

The inclusion stability constants of gibberellin clathrate are consistent with the order of stabilities of the inclusion complex.

However, the pattern does not necessarily appear in the logs that satisfies local completeness. This research aims at finding ways to mine length-two loops without the pattern. It results in a new algorithm (αL+-algorithm) that is based on the α-algorithm. First, an order vector matrix is established by tasks in logs to abstract variant structures of length-two loops. Then, distinction between loops and concurrency structure is obtained by event's frequency and location in traces. Finally, proximity and circuit abstraction are used to eliminate the interference caused by the concurrent branches. The experimental results show that the αL+-algorithm can handle length-two loops with or without 'aba' pattern.

In this work, a MOF was utilized as the signal probe. The signal probe differs from traditional probes; the signal of the cadmium ions (Cd2+) from the MOF can be directly detected without acid dissolution and preconcentration, greatly simplifying the detection steps and reducing the detection time. Moreover, the MOF contains large amounts of Cd2+ions, which could provide high electrochemical signals. Our report is the first time using an MOF as the electrochemical signal probe for an aptasensor application. A gold nanoparticle (Au NP)-doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanocomposite was employed as an immobilized matrix for the sensor because of its high electronic conductivity. Under the optimized experimental conditions, an ultrasensitive aptasensor for the detection of OTA exhibited a wide linear range of 0.05-100 ng mL-1with a low detection limit (LOD) of 10 pg mL-1OTA (at 3σ).

On the basis of modeling and analyzing the traditional AREA thoroughly, an index of the DBADM was proposed to calculate the radius of relative stiffness by using the deflection information of each sensor. Subsequently, the modulus of the subgrade reaction was calculated to minimize the error of the filed-test deflection basin. With the above two features, the DBADM theoretically solves the problem of multiple back-calculation solutions of traditional AREA. Taking the typical structure of a rigid pavement as a study example, the sensitivity, robustness, and computational efficiency of the DBADM are comprehensively investigated in comparison with the state-of-art AREA and Lin method. The numerical analysis results demonstrate that the DBADM has nearly identical sensitivity to each sensor deflection and it improves the robustness significantly, and the back-calculation error is less than 12% within 5% error of some sensor deflection. The DBADM has more robustness to the measured error of each sensor, and can respectively improve 42.5% and 33.5% with respect to AREA and the Lin method. With respect to the computing efficiency, the DBADM is almost equivalent to AREA and is seven times more efficient than the Lin method. Based on the field Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) data of 4C and 4D airports, the back-calculation results demonstrate that the DBADM has the ability to decrease the fitting error of the measured deflection and improve the accuracy of the back-calculation parameters. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.
