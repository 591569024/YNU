Finally, these dominant bacteria involved in hydrolisis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis decreased in number when the temperature was raised to 55 °C and acetotrophic-type metabolism became the major metabolic pathway.

A series of uniaxial and triaxial compressive tests is conducted on phyllite samples by using the MTS815Teststar rock mechanics testing system. Experimental results show that the large deformation and partial failure generally appear before samples reach half of their peak strengths. However, the occurrences of large deformation or initial dilatancy do not indicate that rock completely loses its bearing capacity. If the targeted support or protection can be applied on surrounding rock in time, rock strength is still strong. Damage dilation is regarded as a typical deformation and failure characteristic of phyllite. Furthermore, it affects lateral deformation more easily than axial deformation. Thus, lateral deformation can reflect rock yield or weakening more sensitively. Results show that the anisotropy of rock strength decreases with increasing water content and confining pressure. Moreover, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio vary with the loading direction and translated-confining pressure. From the obtained results of phyllite at different water contents, the strength of phyllite under dry condition presents the most obvious anisotropic characteristics in uniaxial compressive tests. It is found that the anisotropic ratios of compressive strength are mainly below 0.8. Especially, sericite phyllite exhibits the strongest anisotropy with a ratio of 0.48, and the following anisotropic orders from strong to weak are sericite phyllite, chlorite phyllite, quartz phyllite, and carbonaceous phyllite. Moreover, there are different failure modes of phyllite, which also change with the increase of confining pressure and water content. Shear failure occurred uniformly along the weak planes, which indicates that the anisotropic mechanical characteristics of phyllite are controlled by shear mechanism independently. © 2018, Science Press.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm to improve the ISS estimation from the ultrasound RF echo signals. The signals are decomposed into a linear combination of the Gabor atoms, and then the atoms highly matched the regular component are selected based on the critical point in the curve of the first order difference (FOD) of the reconstructed signal to residue ratio (RSRR). Accordingly, the ISSs can be estimated with the adjacent location indexes of the selected Gabor atoms. Results of simulation experiments with the MP-based and WT-based methods are presented. The results demonstrate that the MP-based method can improve the ISS estimation, especially for those simulated signals with low regular components, and potentially provide more accurate information for the disease diagnosis. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","13","Signal processing","Atoms - Bioinformatics - Diagnosis - Histology - Microstructure - Tissue - Tissue engineering - Ultrasonics","Echo signals - First order differences - Inter-scatterer spacing - Matching pursuit - Matching pursuit algorithms - Pathological changes - Quantitative diagnosis - Spatial organization","461 Bioengineering and Biology - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 753.1 Ultrasonic Waves - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 951 Materials Science","","This work was supported by the Grants (81771928 and 61561049) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Situational analysis, as an important foundation for the optimization of land use, needs to focus on the impact of climate factors and socio-economic factors. In this paper, the Markov model and the DLS (Simulation of Land System Dynamics) model are combined for the first time, and the land use pattern in 2020 is simulated based on the data of land use in 2000 and 2010 as well as the climate, soil, topography and socio-economic factors of Yunnan Province. In his paper, we took Yunnan Province as the case study area, and selected 12 driving factors by logistic regression method, then the land use demands and layout of Yunnan Province in 2020 has been forecasted and simulated under business as usual (BAU) scenario and farmland protection (FP) scenario and the changes in ecosystem service value has been calculated. The result shows that: (1) after the regression analysis and ROC (Relative Operating Characteristics) test, the 12 factors selected in this paper have a strong ability to explain the land use change in Yunnan Province. (2) Under the two scenarios, the significant reduction of arable land area is a common feature of land use change in Yunnan Province in the future, and its main land use type will be construction land. However, under FP scenario, the current situation where construction land encroach on arable land will be improved. Compared with the change from 2000 to 2010, the trend of arable land, forest land, water area, construction land and unused land will be the same under the two scenarios, whereas the change trend of grassland was opposite. (3) From 2000 to 2020, the value of ecosystem services in Yunnan Province is on the rise, but the ecosystem service value under FP scenario is higher than that of the ecosystem services under BAU scenario. In general, land use in 2020 in Yunnan Province continues the pattern of 2010, but there are also significant spatial differences. Under the BAU scenario, the construction land is mainly in the south of Lijiang City and the northeastern part of Kunming. Under the FP scenario, the new construction land is concentrated near the Lashi dam in northern Yunnan Province, and the high-quality arable land in the valley will be better protected. The research results can provide reference for the optimization of land use pattern in Yunnan Province, and provide scientific basis for land use management and planning. Based on the value of ecosystem services, we should implement the policy of strict protection of arable land, both to ensure food supply and promote the healthy development of ecological environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","45","Land use","Climate change - Climate models - Dynamic light scattering - Economics - Ecosystems - Factor analysis - Food supply - Forestry - Markov processes - Regression analysis","Ecosystem service values - Ecosystem services - Logistic regression method - Markov model - Relative operating characteristics - Spatial patterns - Value of ecosystem services - Yunnan province","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 741.1 Light/Optics - 822.3 Food Products - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 71363061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71363061 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The dynamic response and failure mechanism of the rocky slope with discontinuous joints under the combined effects of reservoir water and seismic force were studied. The experiment simulates the rise and fall of the reservoir water by injecting water into and pumping water out the model box. The wave reflection created by the box wall is reduced by the wave absorbing device. The result shows that with the input of seismic wave, the cracks in slope under the reservoir water level expenses quickly. Under the same seismic wave input, the acceleration amplification effect of the slope for the high water level case is less obvious compared to the low water level case due to the presence of the water pressure. The infiltration of reservoir water aggravates the development of the slope cracks. The sudden drop of reservoir water level brings a greater amplification effect to the acceleration of slope surface, which is not positive to the stability of slope. The earthquake induces the cracks along the joints on the upper layer of the slope. The increase of the seismic force and the infiltration of reservoir water aggravate the development of the cracks and finally result in the appearance of the penetrating cracks. The interaction of the seismic force, infiltration of reservoir water and its sudden drop together lead to the overturn and sliding failure of the slope along its upper discontinuity. © 2018, Science Press.

First of all, with reference to China national standard GB/T 23885-2009 “Jadeite-jade Grading,” the color appearance of jadeite-jade color green was analyzed contrastively with the help of three pieces of GemDialogue color chip images G, Y2G, and B2G where CIE recommended standard light sources D65, A, and CWF, and then it is proposed that the best light source of jadeite-jade color green measuring and evaluating is standard D65 based on quantitative analysis of samples’ lightness L*, chroma C*, hue h0. Secondly, according to samples color green and five pieces of GemDialogue color chip images G2Y, Y2G, G, B2G, and G2B, jadeite-jade color was graded in seven levels from the best end “Fancy Vivid” to the last end “Very Light” with the contribution of five different overlap modes of three color masks: black/gray transparent, brown transparent, and black/white opaque. Furthermore, the high accuracy of the method is verified by clustering analysis and Fisher’s discrimination reversely. It draws conclusions that there are two evaluation methods of jadeite-jade color green; the first is the colorimetric way of GemDialogue color chip images, and the complementary is the way of Fisher functional method which sample parameters could be back substituted, and all these two methods could be extended to other green gem quality evaluation. © 2018, The Author(s).","29","Colorimetry","Color - Grading - Image quality - Light sources - Quality control - Silicate minerals","Clustering analysis - Color chips - Color mask - Evaluation methods - Feasibility studies - GemDialogue - Jadeite-jade color green - Quality evaluation","482.2 Minerals - 741.1 Light/Optics - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The NC-dots were completely characterized using various techniques. The NC-dots could be employed as a fluorescent material for the sensing of TNP with distinguished selectivity. The addition of TNP into the NC-dots resulted in splendid quenching, which was ascribed to the integrative action of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, electron transfer, and the hydrogen-bond interactions between NC-dots and TNP.

The shortages of the single QD and graphene materials could be remedied by the synergistic effects from QDs/GR composite materials; meanwhile, some unique phenomena and superior physical properties were also produced. The QDs/GR composites processed better photocatalytic activities, higher photon capture abilities and excellent optical responsibilities. Therefore, they were widely applied in various techniques. Here, we reviewed and discussed recent research progresses about the QDs/GR composites and focused on their industrial preparation and commercial applications. Among these synthetic methods, ion beam sputtering deposition (IBSD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) were discussed in detail because they could be directly applied in commercial industry for preparing size-tunable quantum dots. In another part, the applications of the QDs/GR composites were also discussed, the advanced physical and chemical properties promoted these composites to have numerous potential for being applied in photodetectors, lithium ion batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors and other devices. The appropriate synthetic method for QDs/GR materials is highly dependent on the requirements of its applications.

However, the interactions between melatonin and other important molecules in Haematococcus pluvialis response stresses are largely unknown. In the present study, exogenous melatonin improved H. pluvialis resistance to nitrogen starvation and high light. We concluded that exogenous melatonin treatment prevented the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and limited cell damage induced by abiotic stress through activation of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants. Astaxanthin, a major antioxidant in H. pluvialis cells, exhibited a 2.25-fold increase in content after treatment with melatonin. The maximal astaxanthin content was 32.4 mg g-1. The functional roles of the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway induced by melatonin were also evaluated. The results clearly indicate that cAMP signaling pathways are positively associated with microalgal astaxanthin biosynthesis. Additionally, the NO-dependent MAPK signaling cascade is activated in response to astaxanthin accumulation induced by melatonin, confirming that MAPK is a target of NO action in physiological processes.

Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that hot electrons in BiVO4 {010} more easily cross the Schottky barrier to expedite the migration from BiVO4 {010} to Au and are subsequently captured by the excited holes in Cu2O. This crystal-facet-dependent electron shuttle allows the long-lived holes and electrons to stay in the valence band of BiVO4 and conduction band of Cu2O, respectively, contributing to improved light-driven CO2 reduction.

However, in real life, the proximity relationship is a fuzzy concept and difficult to measure only by an absolute distance threshold. Furthermore, the spatial clique generating process consumes huge computational and spatial costs. In this paper, we propose a new framework for mining co-location patterns based on density peaks clustering and fuzzy theory.

The composites are prepared by one-pot method and X-ray diffraction results reveal that these compositional phases are highly compatible. Analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates the existence of Co3+ and Co2+ mixed valences in the composites. Compared with single-phase Ca3Co2O6, thermal expansion coefficient of the composite is favorably low and matches better with the electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells. Test of electrical conductivity shows that the composites are comparable to the pure Ca3Co2O6 in charge transport capacity.

A pinhole-array aperture (11×11 pinholes) is used to the calibration of the rotation, scaling and translation relationships between the fields of the two channels. As a result, the high accuracy field matching of two-field solar images with the accuracy reaching up to 0.031″ is accomplished by affine transformation.

The presence of complex relations amongst individual series poses difficulties with respect to traditional modelling, computation and statistical theory. In this paper, we propose a method for clustering multivariate time series by using multi-relational community detection in complex networks. Firstly, a set of multivariate time series is transformed into a multi-relational network. Then, an algorithm for multi-relational community detection based on multiple nonnegative matrices factorization (MNMF) is proposed and is applied to identify time series clusters. The transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain benefits from the ability of networks to characterize both local and global relationship amongst nodes (representing data samples), while the use of MNMF can give full play to complex relations amongst individual series and preserve the multi-way nature of multivariate information.

An ant colony optimization algorithm with the pheromone update strategy of exponential form was proposed to solve the stochastic user equilibrium problem. In addition, the dynamic cycle process of traffic assignment was established from the logit model loading to the iterative calculations of traffic demand, path flow, road flow, road impedance and path impedance. The road flows and road impedances of Nguyen-Dupuis road network model were calculated and compared with the result computed by the successive average algorithm. The sensitivities of ant colony optimization algorithm and successive average algorithm were analyzed by adjusting the factors of the traveler's familiarity with the road network. Analysis result shows that the road flow distributions computed by the successive average algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithm are 20-280 and 40-260 pcu, respectively, and the flow distribution interval computed by the latter decreases by 15.4%, while the maximum road flow decreases by 7.1%. Therefore, the road flow calculated by the ant colony optimization algorithm is more balanced. When using the ant colony optimization algorithm, the standard deviation of each road section flow in Nguyen-Dupuis road network model reduces from 65 to 48 pcu, 88% of the alternative paths' impedances distribute in 61-64, and 84% of the path impedances are lower than the result computed by the successive average algorithm. Therefore, the ant colony optimization algorithm can reduce the user travel time. When the familiarity of the road network is 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 7, and 11, respectively, the standard deviation of each road section calculated by the successive average algorithm is 75, 65, 50, 47, 45, and 45 pcu, respectively, and the standard deviation calculated by the ant colony optimization algorithm is 48, 48, 48, 47, 43, and 43 pcu, respectively. With the increase of road network familiarity, the range of the flow assigned to each road gradually decreases, and the standard deviation tends to be stable. The pheromone update strategy has greater influence on the probability of traveler's path selection, and the probability selecting the path with smaller impedance is higher. Therefore, the ant colony optimization algorithm gradually outperforms the successive average algorithm for the flow distribution of each road section. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

In this work, a novel, rapid, and convenient electrochemical approach for recognition of tryptophan isomers (L-/D-Trp) was constructed based on the alternating layer-by-layer assembly of water-soluble cationic and anionic pillar[5]arene on a carboxylic graphene (C-Gra) modified glass carbon electrode. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was employed to study the electrochemical recognition of tryptophan isomers. The results reveal that both the peak currents of L-Trp and D-Trp decreased with the increasing of the layer number of the assembled pillar[5]arene, whereas the peak current value's difference between the L-Trp and D-Trp increased with the increased layers, which demonstrated an efficient route for discriminating the L-Trp and D-Trp. The recognition mechanism was studied by1H NMR spectra and molecular docking. The host−guest interaction is different for D- and L-Trp due to the opposite steric configurations of the Trp isomers, resulting in significantly discernible electrochemical differences in both peak currents and consequently effective chiral recognition of Trp isomers. This study is the first example that shows the construction of electrochemical chiral separation platform based on pillar[5]arene. This method shows potential applications in many fields, including separation, purification, storage of chiral molecule, drug detection and analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","49","Isomers","Amino acids - Chirality - Electrodes - Interfaces (materials) - Molecular recognition - Multilayer films - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Stereochemistry - Voltammetry","Differential pulse voltammetry - ELectrochemical methods - Electrochemical recognition - Focus of researches - Glass carbon electrodes - Layer-by-layer assemblies - pillar[5]arene - Recognition mechanism","801 Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 951 Materials Science","Number: cstc2017jcyjAX0031, Acronym: CSTC, Sponsor: Chongqing Science and Technology Commission; Number: cstc2017jcyjA0656, Acronym: CSTC, Sponsor: Chongqing Science and Technology Commission; Number: 2017HA013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was financially supported by the Program for Leading Talents, Department of Science and Technology of Yunnan Province (grant no. 2017HA013 ) and the Basic Research Project of Science and Technology Commission of Chongqing (grant no. cstc2017jcyjA0656 and cstc2017jcyjAX0031 ).

Since Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee are using the same frequency band, they produce mutual interference when they operate at the same time. The simultaneous operation may lead to significant performance degradation. Wireless networks can be developed based on the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol or based on another protocol which is built on IEEE 802.15.4. The ZigBee protocol standard, which is built on top of IEEE 802.15.4, provides additional benefits of a well-developed wireless networking standard. And the ZigBee is designed, built and supported by hundreds of the world’s leading technology companies. In this paper, we introduced the basic concepts of the three systems that we used, based on Shannon theorem and Gaussian channel truth theory, to improve transmission performance of the systems. This improvement allocated the chaotic channel reasonably, base on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing theorem, to reduce the expenses on the channel. All of modeling and simulation result were obtained by MATLAB, and two examples that are similar with the actual application situation were exhibited respectively in main simulation section below. Finally, this paper proposed a new channel control mechanism which can make the communication performance improved. The effect of performance of the communication is obvious, especially with increasing users. Hence, during limited frequency band, more customs can exist, with higher channel utilization rate. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","10","IEEE Standards","Bluetooth - Intelligent mechatronics - Internet protocols - MATLAB - Robotics - Wi-Fi - Wireless local area networks (WLAN) - Zigbee","2.4 ghz - Channel control - Communication performance - Ieee 802.15.4 protocols - Performance degradation - Simultaneous operation - Transmission performance - Wireless networking standard","716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 731.5 Robotics - 731.7 Mechatronix - 921 Mathematics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, its ubiquitous sampling and openness results in serious privacy concerns. People's activity trajectories may reveal their private information such as home and work place and thus requires proper protection. In this paper, we propose a novel design scheme, called query logics detached storage (QLDS), for trajectory privacy protection. The core idea of QLDS is to extract the query logics for personal trajectory retrieval and make actual trajectory tuples not clustered to any route-identity or user-identity at server end, which introduces fine-granularity anonymity. The QLDS design scheme stores the extracted query logics at users own client devices and the un-clustered location tuples at the backend server, guaranteeing trajectory reconstruction at client-end and privacy preservation at server-end. Besides, integration of QLDS with other privacy protection approaches can further enhance the protection strength and bring flexible configurations to meet individuals' variable privacy concerns. The theoretical analytics is provided for the privacy and utility evaluation. The data retrieval performance of QLDS is experimentally evaluated in real-world internet environment. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","48","Trajectories","Computation theory - Crowdsourcing - Data privacy - Data processing - Digital storage - Human computer interaction - Information systems - Mobile computing - Sensors - Servers","Internet environment - Participatory Sensing - Privacy preservation - Privacy protection - Private information - Spatiotemporal phenomena - Trajectory privacies - Trajectory reconstruction","721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.2 Information Dissemination",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the protective mechanism of NGR1in the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via the estrogen receptor (ER) pathway remains unclear, which hinder its application. This study aimed to study the preventive mechanisms of NGR1in the apoptosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes after hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). NGR1did not affect the expression of ERα and ERβ proteins in normal H9c2 cardiomyocytes. However, NGR1could upregulate the ERα and G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) proteins in H9c2 cardiomyocytes after H/R without affecting ERβ levels. Moreover, it significantly affected the expression levels of PI3K and its downstream apoptosis proteins such as Bcl-2 Associated X Protein (Bax), B cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2 (Bcl-2), caspase-3, and so forth. Whereas, after adding the PI3K protein antagonist, the modulatory expression levels of PI3K and its downstream apoptosis proteins were remarkably abolished. After adding ERα and GPR30 antagonists, NGR1had no significant effect on the expression of PI3K and its downstream Akt protein in the model group.

This suggests that aluminum reacts with high-valence sulfur to generate low-valence sulfur at digestion temperature, which is consistent with our thermodynamic calculation results. As aluminum dosage increases, sulfur digestion rate decreases notably, and the alumina digestion rate decreases slightly, while sulfur content in red mud markedly increases.

However, furanic resins have not been reported as being used alone as wood panel adhesives. In the present work furfuryl alcohol-aldehyde resins were prepared by reacting furfuryl alcohol with three different aldehydes, namely formaldehyde, glyoxal and glutaraldehyde. p-Toluene sulfonic acid and an acid self-neutralizing system were used as resin hardeners to prepare plywood and evaluate their bonding performances. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA) were used to analyze the thermomechanical properties of the resins and the structure of the oligomers formed. The results showed that formaldehyde and glyoxal can react with furfurly alcohol to obtain resins of excellent performance. However, the reaction of glutaraldehyde with furfuryl alcohol appeared to be difficult, the self-condensation of furfuryl alcohol instead predominating. The acidity of the curing agent has a great influence on the bonding performance of the resin. The furfurly alcohol-glyoxal (FAG) resin showed also a good bonding strength and water resistance, higher than the standard requirements (≥ 0.7MPa), even when using an acid self-neutralizing system as hardener. The FAG resin was particularly good considering that no formaldehyde was used. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","32","Adhesives","Formaldehyde - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Hardening - Mass spectrometry - Nuclear magnetic resonance - Plywood - Resins - Thermoanalysis - Wood products","Adhesives for wood - Environmental issues - Fourier transform infrared - Furfuryl alcohol - MALDI-TOF - Matrix-assisted-laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight - Thermomechanical analysis - Thermomechanical properties","537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.2 Wood and Wood Products - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The leaching behaviors of the main metallic impurities (Fe, Al, Ca, Ti, Ni, V and Cu) were investigated using various leaching approaches. The typical precipitates at Si grain boundaries before and after leaching were observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The leaching results show that the order of impurity removal efficiency, from highest to lowest, is CuCCL > HF-H2O2 leaching > HF leaching. After CuCCL, the total metal impurity concentration can be reduced from 6759 ppmw to 193.41 ppmw. The numerous micro-scale “channels” introduced by CuCCL are beneficial for the removal of impurities, especially for the non-dissolving metal impurities, such as calcium and aluminum. The results indicated that CuCCL is promising as an industrial purification method to produce solar-grade silicon. © 2018, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","30","Copper compounds","Catalysis - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Grain boundaries - Impurities - Leaching - Metallurgy - Metals - Purification - Removal - Scanning electron microscopy - Silicon","Chemical leaching - Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy - Leaching behavior - Metallic impurity - Metallurgical grade silicons (MGSi) - Purification method - Removal of impurities - Solar grade silicons","531.1 Metallurgy - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, behind the thriving development, we also notice that real estate in our country is subject to traditional development mode at present. Based on the interests of enterprises, the products are developed at a maximum estimated value. Therefore, in essence, the mode has neglected the important value of the design. The traditional development mode tends to be problematic and flawed. “Design-oriented” real estate development mode boasts the advantages of wide–range applicability, short time and fast replication. In other industries, the “design-oriented” development mode is not yet highly appreciated and widely used because of its current lack of in-depth understanding and awareness. As China’s real estate industry leader, Vanke started early to explore the “design-oriented” development mode and this strategy gradually becomes clear in the challenging exploration. Through the actual cases of “design-oriented” development mode, the direction of a new real estate development mode is further verified to offer reference to other real estate companies in the future development process. In this way, “design” as the dominant means can essentially improve the development problems like waste of resources, inferior product quality, prolonged construction period and reduced design benefits, then give full play to the leading role of “design” in real estate development. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","13","Product design","Investments - Regional planning","Construction period - Design thinking - Development problems - In-depth understanding - Real estate - Real estate companies - Real estate development - Real estate industries","403.2 Regional Planning and Development - 913.1 Production Engineering",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Therefore, the position of measuring electrode has a significant effect on the measurement results when measuring the grounding resistance of the grounding grid. On the basis of the traditional vertical three-layer soil structure model, taking the vertical drop between the water and the bank into account, we build a soil structure model which is more consistent with the actual situation. Based on this soil model, the grounding resistance calculation and the distribution of surface potential when current is injected are calculated, and the influence of measurement electrode layout position on the resistance measurement is analyzed when using the rules method, and the correction method of compensation point position is analyzed, discussed, and put forward. The analysis results show that the potential of the soil near river is distorted when there is an obvious vertical drop in the surface layer. By using the rules method to measure grounding resistance and wiring along the river, the distortion of measurement result of ground resistance and compensation point position is serious when the horizontal distance between the electrode and the river is less than 50 m, and the measured results tend to be stable with the increase of the distance. In this case, the compensation point is closer to the ground grid than the '0.618', and its value decreases with the increase of the soil resistivity reflection coefficient.

Tracing the geographical origin is important to the authentication and quality assessment of this species. 177 wild samples collected from central, southeast and northwest Yunnan Province, China, were analyzed by single analytical method and data fusion strategies (low- and mid-levels) using Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectroscopies combined with chemometrics (partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machines grid search (SVM-GS)), for categorizing samples from different geographic origins. According to the results, mid-level data fusion strategy presented a better generalization performance and accuracy rates based on latent variables selected by PLS-DA than single analytical method and low-level data fusion strategy. Accuracy rates were almost 100% when both of the PLS-DA and SVM-GS were employed for classifying samples picked from southeast and northwest districts based on mid-level dataset. For samples collected from central of Yunnan where was divided into seven categories in this paper, the accuracy rates of training set and test set of PLS-DA and SVM-GS were preferable (>87%). Based on the mid-level data set, both of the classification results of PLS-DA and SVM-GS presented satisfying accuracy for 177 samples. Additionally, as small as possible parameters showed in mid-level data set, it suggested that this method was robust and generalized.

In this study, we prepared persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) and constructed a label-free sensor for sensitive and selective detection of pollutants in real samples and test papers. Following excitation, PLNPs could store absorbed light energy and release it in the form of luminescence. Compared with a fluorescence-based technique, a PLNPs-based measurement could effectively avoid background interference. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection for TNP was found to be 10 nM, while for an antibiotic it was 5 nM. The nanoprobe was successfully applied for the detection of pollutants in real samples including milk and Dianchi Lake water samples. Due to the long-lasting afterglow nature of PLNPs, the signal-to-noise ratio could be greatly increased in complex real samples. By hand-writing with TNP solution as ink on filter paper, the photoluminescence (PL) of the part stained with TNP was immediately quenched. Moreover, after direct exposure under a UV lamp for 10 min and without further excitation, the luminescence of the test paper was investigated to avoid interferents. This PLNP material could be potentially employed as a multi-responsive luminescent sensor. In addition, these easy-to-use visual techniques could provide a powerful tool for a convenient POC assay of organic pollutants. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","39","Pollution detection","Antibiotics - Light - Nanoparticles - Organic pollutants - Photoluminescence - Signal to noise ratio - Water pollution","Detection of pollutant - Environmental safety - Label-free sensors - Luminescent sensors - Optimal conditions - Persistent luminescence - Security screening - Selective detection","453 Water Pollution - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: 01100205020503104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011CB911000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20975034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21465026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21275044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21165023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: J1210040, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21177036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21605130, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 21605130, 21165023, 21465026, J1210040, 20975034, 21177036, 21275044), and the National Key Scientic Program of China (2011CB911000, 01100205020503104).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Air stripping is one of the effective technologies for ammonia removal, but low separation efficiency and huge stripping tower rendering the process techno-economically inefficient. Hence, microwave heating and high gravity separation are employed to intensify air stripping process. Microwave dielectric characteristics for this solution indicate strong absorption, which can reduce the heating time rapidly. The effect of main operating parameters such as the rotational speed (ω), liquid flow rate (QL), gas flow rate (Qg), and stripping temperature (T)) on the volumetric liquid mass transfer coefficient (KLa) and stripping efficiency (η) are assessed. Results show that KLa increase significantly with increasing gas flow rate, followed by rotating speed and liquid flow rate. However, the η decrease with increase in QLdue to reduction in the liquid hydraulic retention time. Under the optimal conditions, KLa and η could reach 0.0061 s−1and 99.3%, respectively.

Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (Type-2 FS) have a good prospect in image fusion field, because it can effectively address the uncertain and fuzzy problem in image fusion for selecting the high-quality pixels or coefficients of source images. We try to extend the application fields of Type-2 FS and improve the performance of MSIF; therefore, this paper presents a hybrid method by combining the local spatial frequency (LSF) with interval Type-2 FS in nonsubsampled shearlet transform (NSST) domain. NSST is used to decompose source images, and interval Type-2 FS and LSF is employed to extract the regional features of source images; so it can extract and fuse the detailed features of different source images accurately. First, NSST is performed to decompose the source images into low frequency and high frequency sub-images. Second, LSF-based fusion rule is applied to fuse low frequency sub-images. Thirdly, a novel fusion process based on interval Type-2 FS is designed to fuse high frequency sub-images. At last, inverse NSST2 (INSST) is implemented to reconstruct the fused images. The experimental and contrastive results of different image sets show that the proposed method is an effective MSIF scheme, which can achieve better fusion effect than the existing representative methods. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","63","Image fusion","Fuzzy sets - Image processing - Inverse problems","Interval type-2 fuzzy sets - Multi-sensor information fusion - Multifocus image fusion - Shearlet transforms - Spatial frequency","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing","Number: 2017SE202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Software Engineering; Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: -, Acronym: BIOINT, Sponsor: Biological Interactions Doctoral Programme; Number: 61640306, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Manuscript received December 18, 2017; accepted December 30, 2017.

Adding SnSO4to the cement mixer resulted in formation of calcium hydroxo-tin, (Sn6O4(OH)4) and CaSn(OH)4. The setting time and strength of cement are obviously enhanced by the addition of stannous sulfate than that of gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) and stannous chloride (SnCl2), which can be attributed to the coupling of sulfate and stannous ions; Compared with gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O), SnSO4could hardly produce delayed ettringite (60 days) under hot temperature curing conditions; and water conservation may ensure the full use of stannous sulfate in cement. The total reducing capacity of the SnSO4on hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) may decrease under hot temperature, but its reduction capacity is still higher than that of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) under the same conditions. Results from SEM showed that SnSO4was incorporated into the hydrated cement matrix. © 2018","38","Tin compounds","Calcium compounds - Cements - Chemical properties - Chlorine compounds - Chromium - Chromium compounds - Gypsum - Iron compounds - Setting - Strength of materials - Sulfur compounds - Water conservation","Ferrous sulfate - Hexavalent chromium - Physical and chemical properties - Reducing capacity - Reduction capacity - Stannous chloride - Temperature and humidities - Temperature curing","412.1 Cement - 444 Water Resources - 482.2 Minerals - 543.1 Chromium and Alloys - 801 Chemistry - 951 Materials Science","Number: 51078175, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2008E038M, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China and Yunnan Province (Grant No. 51078175 , 2008E038M ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results revealed that the CTS-POM particles exhibit multiporous microsphere morphology, which was first observed in CTS materials. A possible growing mechanism was proposed based on POM concentration-dependent growth study of the microspheres. The photodegradation of RhB and H2 production under UV-vis irradiation was done to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the samples. The results indicated that the as-synthesized CTS-POM exhibited enhanced photodegration of RhB and photocatalytic H2 generation compared to pure CTS particles, and the content of loaded POM has an important impact on the catalytic activity of CTS-POM.

However, the significant surface structures and properties for photo-catalytic absorption layers have not yet been studied in detail for CZTS. Hence, the surface structure and electronic properties of low-index stoichiometric CZTS surfaces are calculated based on density functional theory. The relaxation is much large for the (001), (100), (101) and (112) surfaces. Moreover, more surface states appear at the bottom of conduction band and the top of valence band. The conduction band is mainly composed of S-3p and Sn-5p orbits. The valence band top is mainly composed of S-3p and Cu-3d orbits. The band gap values of five surfaces do not vary greatly. The dangling bond density for the (112) surfaces is minimal, resulting in minimum surface energy. Finally, the equilibrium morphology of CZTS is constructed by the Wulff rule. It is found that the {101} surface is the dominant surface (72.6%). These results will help us to better understand the surface properties of absorption layer that is related to CZTS surface and provide theoretical support for future experimental studies. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","32","Structural properties","Conduction bands - Copper compounds - Density functional theory - Electronic properties - Energy gap - Morphology - Surface structure - Thin film solar cells - Tin compounds - Valence bands - Zinc compounds","Cu2ZnSnS4 - DFT calculation - Equilibrium morphology - Minimum surfaces - Photovoltaic absorbers - Significant surfaces - Structural and electronic properties - Structures and properties","408 Structural Design - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 951 Materials Science","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Anesthesiology; Number: 2016DG005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015HB015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21473082, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21473082), Project of Application Basic Research of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2015FB123, 2016DG005), Key Laboratory of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2016DG005), and the 18th Yunnan Province Young Academic and Technical Leaders Reserve Talent Project (Grant No. 2015HB015).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

As the spatial-temporal data produced in traffic transportation systems explosively growth, the operators in traffic field are trying to adopt the new emerging big data solutions born in the internet area. However, it is hard to find a high cost/performance solution to build this platform because diverse combinations of hardware and software configuration. Currently, the operators selecting solutions depend on simple evaluation results based on internet benchmarks such as terasort. Two issues including: (1) is it appropriate that evaluating a solution for spatial-temporal applications by internet benchmark; and (2) what is the characteristic of spatial-temporal application and the potential optimization measurements, have never been fully explored. We address this issue by a novel workload characterization tool, called Extensible Metric Importance Analysis (EMIA), for big data applications. The key idea is a performance model based on ensemble learning, which takes the program metrics as the input, outputs the performance metric such as execution time, and ranks these metrics as their corresponding importance. Based on EMIA, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to program behaviors of five representative spatial-temporal applications and nine popular internet big data benchmarks. Experimental results show that spatial-temporary applications present unique characteristics and it is unreasonable to evaluate solutions for spatial-temporary applications by internet benchmarks. Moreover, we optimize spatial-temporary applications via applying measurements to the key factors identified by EMIA, achieving obviously performance improvement. © 2018 IEEE.","9","Benchmarking","Application programs - Big data - Principal component analysis - Solution mining","Autotuning - Ensemble learning - Hbase - Performance Model - Performance optimizations - Urbanization","502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2017ZB009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was financially supported by the Doctoral Research Foundation of Yunnan Normal University (2017ZB009).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Diffraction-free beams are widely used in laser drilling, laser precision alignment, optical precision control, optical micromanipulation, optical communication, plasma guidance, light bullet, synthesis of autofocusing beam, nonlinear optics, etc. In this paper, the expressions, generation methods and corresponding experimental results of the various nondiffraction beams are presented. There are many ways to generate the Bessel beam, they being circular slit, computed hologram, spherical aberration lens, resonant cavity, axicon, and metasurface. The main methods of generating the nondiffraction beams are summarized, and each method is analyzed in depth from the cost of the system, and then some suggestions for improving and perfecting are made. For the generation of non-diffraction beams, the passive methods are used most to convert other beams into corresponding non-diffraction beams by optical components. Due to the low damage threshold and high cost of optical components, the power, energy and beam quality of a non-diffracting beam will be limited. How to generate a high-power, high-beam quality non-diffracting beam will be a hot research spot. Diffractionless beams have attracted a great deal of interest due to their unique non-diffraction, transverseaccelerating (or self-bending) and self-healing property. Transverse-accelerating property refers to that non-diffraction beams propagate along a parabola trajectory. The diffractionless beams' propagation trajectory control method implemented by changing system parameters is simple and easily successful, but cannot reverse acceleration direction, and its controlling range is limited. The self-healing property means that the non-diffraction beam tends to reform during propagation in spite of severe perturbations imposed. Both the Airy beam and the Bessel beam exhibit self-healing properties during propagation. And non-diffraction beams have potential applications in many fields. In atmosphere, such as in optical communication, non-diffracting beam exhibits more resilience against perturbations. Finally, brief summary and outlook of non-diffraction beams playing important roles in future study, and their application prospects are presented. In addition to Airy beam and Bessel beam, for other non-diffraction beams due to the complexity of the beams themselves, by comparison, their applications are investigated very little, so the applications in Mathieu beam, cosine beam, and parabolic beam will be a hot research spot. © 2018 Chinese Physical Society.","139","Aberrations","Bessel functions - Diffraction - Diffractive optics - Geometrical optics - Laser beams - Nonlinear optics - Optical communication - Self-healing materials - Wave plasma interactions","Airy beams - Bessel beam - Diffraction beams - Diffraction free beams - Long-distance propagation - Mathieu beams - Optical micromanipulation - Self-healing properties","415 Metals, Plastics, Wood and Other Structural Materials - 717.1 Optical Communication Systems - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.1.1 Nonlinear Optics - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions - 921 Mathematics - 932.3 Plasma Physics","Number: 2016FA025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Graduate Student's Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University; Number: 2016HE010, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61475026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","*Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61765015, 61475026, 61275135, 61108029), the Top Talents Introduction Program of Yunnan Province, China (Grant Nos. 2016HE009, 2016HE010), the Yunnan Provincial Key Program for Basic Research, China (Grant No. 2016FA025), and the Yunnan University’s Research Innovation Fund for Graduate Students (Grant No. YDY17012).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Moreover, the microclimatic conditions in greenhouses under different local weather conditions, the produced thermal energy, and electric energy consumption were analyzed. The efficiency of the solar collector was determined and the effectiveness of the evacuated tube solar collector with the electric heat pump was also examined. Results revealed that the internal air temperature in the heated greenhouse exceeds the temperature inside the unheated (control) greenhouse by 2 °C–3 °C, whereas, the relative humidity decreased by 10% in the heated greenhouse. Furthermore, the thermal efficiency of the solar collector and the payback period were 0.49 and 4.1 years, respectively.

The resultant changes were assessed in terms of the SDBC surface characteristics and metal(loid) sorption capacities. Continuous leaching was found to gradually decrease the density of basic functional groups and increase the density of carboxyl groups as well as cation exchange capacity on the SDBC surface. It was attributed to the surface acidification and oxidation process by the leaching process, yet it occurred to a lesser extent than the atmospheric exposure. Continuous leaching increased Pb(II), Cr(VI), and As(III) sorption capacity of the SDBC, probably because the increase in carboxyl groups promoted inner-sphere complexation and Fe oxidation as revealed by spectroscopic analysis. It was noteworthy that the SDBC in the unsaturated and saturated zones under continuous leaching displayed distinctive effects on metal(loid) sorption capacity than the atmospheric exposure.

The enhancement of the up-conversion (UC) emission intensity of Er3+in the glass ceramic (GC) was attributed to the crystallization of Ba2LaF7nano-crystals with a low phonon energy compared to the precursor glass counterpart. The temperature-depended fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of thermally coupled emitting states (4S3/2,2H11/2) behavior of Er3+was studied under the excitation of 980 nm. The maximum thermal sensitivity was approximately 0.43% K−1at 298 K. Besides, the temperature of Ba2LaF7GC rose from 336 to 407 K, when the laser pump power density increased from 1.01 to 9.59 W/cm2.

Neglecting the dynamics of the relationship at the lake-specific scale would mislead the eutrophication control strategy. The Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) is a flexible tool to explore dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship and improves the overall estimation accuracy by partial pooling of data. In this study, we used the BHM to show the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship in one of the most eutrophic lakes in China (Lake Dianchi). We defined an indicator (the Chla/TP ratio, CPR), to represent the susceptibility of Chla to TP. We conducted a model selection process and used the CPR-TP curves to show the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the Chla-TP relationships. We determined that the wind caused the spatial dynamics due to the horizontal transport of phytoplankton, while the water temperature and the percentage of soluble reactive phosphorus led to the seasonal dynamics via increasing the growth rate of phytoplankton. These findings helped the eutrophication control in Lake Dianchi. We found that compared with the strategy to decrease the TP concentration, decreasing the susceptibility is expected to be more effective. Finally, we concluded that exploring the dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship provided an important basis for eutrophication control at the lake-specific scale. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","49","Dynamics","Chlorophyll - Eutrophication - Hierarchical systems - Lakes - Phosphorus - Phytoplankton","Bayesian hierarchical model - Chla-TP relationship - Eutrophication control - Horizontal transport - Lake eutrophications - Overall estimation - Seasonal dynamics - Soluble reactive phosphorus","471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 961 Systems Science","Number: 2017PL002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB458900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 51721006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Funding Information This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2015CB458900), National Science Foundation of China (51721006) and Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed (2017PL002).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

One is the high-cycle-fatigue failure mode caused by cyclic thermal shock loading in steady-state conditions. The other is the low-cycle-fatigue failure mode caused by thermal shock loading under transition conditions such as cold start, rapid acceleration, and fast deceleration. Although piston thermal loading has been widely studied by previous domestic and foreign researchers, the work focused on the thermal loading of steady-state conditions and overlooked the impact of the drastic variations of piston transient thermal loading on piston reliability and useful life, and the research result cannot reflect true realistic variations of piston thermal loading, and cannot accurately predict and evaluate the thermal fatigue life of the piston. In order to study the thermal loads of diesel engine pistons in different operating conditions, a non-road high-pressure-common-rail diesel engine was analyzed by using the method of thermal-mechanical decoupling. The finite-element simulation model of piston thermal loading under the steady-state condition of rate power and the above-mentioned transient condition was established. The simulation model was developed based on the experimental results of transient temperature measurements of the piston top. The model was successfully used to reveal the variation trends of the transient thermal loads of the pistons under these conditions. The analysis results showed that the time-dependent or crank-angle-dependent fluctuation of the piston thermal load under the steady-state condition of rated power was only limited to the piston top, the firing deck, and the first ring groove. As the fluctuation penetration distance measured from the piston top increased, the fluctuation amplitude decreased. The maximum fluctuation penetration distance of temperature was 3 mm, and the maximum fluctuation penetration distance of thermal stress was 5 mm. Under the transient conditions, the fluctuation amplitudes of the thermal loads were greater than those under the steady-state conditions, with the fluctuation of the cold start process being the greatest. Specifically, the maximum fluctuation amplitudes of the temperature, thermal stress, and thermal strain of cold start process were 200, 40 MPa, and 0.3 mm, respectively. During the process of rapid acceleration, although the maximum fluctuation amplitudes of the piston temperature and thermal strain were smaller than those of the cold start process, being 120 and 0.12 mm, respectively, the maximum fluctuation amplitude of the piston thermal stress reached the greatest, being 50 MPa. Such a large variation of stress had a great impact on piston durability life. During the process of rapid deceleration, the maximum fluctuation amplitudes of the piston temperature, thermal stress, and thermal strain were the smallest among all operating process, being 20, 10 MPa, and 0.02 mm, respectively. During the rapid deceleration process, the measured metal temperatures of the piston in various locations all increased shortly, then gradually decreased by a small magnitude, and finally reached stable after 200 s. The maximum fluctuation amplitudes of the piston temperature, thermal stress, and thermal strain during fast deceleration conditions were the smallest among all operating conditions, being 30, 10 MPa, and 0.02 mm, respectively.

Although the crystal diffraction technique has greatly contributed to our understanding of the structures of the involved transporters, a description of the dynamic transport mechanism at the single-molecule level has been extremely elusive. In this study, we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force tracing to directly monitor the transport of a single molecule, d-glucose, across living cell membranes. Our results show that the force to transport a single molecule of d-glucose across cell membranes is 37 ± 9 pN, and the corresponding transport interval is approximately 20 ms, while the average speed is approximately 0.3 μm s-1. Furthermore, our calculated force profile from molecular dynamics simulations showed quantitatively good agreement with the force tracing observation and revealed detailed information regarding the glucose transport path, indicating that two salt bridges, K38/E299 and K300/E426, play critical roles during glucose transport across glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). This role was further verified using biological experiments that disrupted these two bridges and measured the uptake of glucose into the cells. Our approaches led to the first unambiguous description of the glucose transport process across cell membranes at the single-molecule level and demonstrated the biological importance of the two salt bridges for transporting glucose across GLUT1. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","51","Glucose","Atomic force microscopy - Cells - Cytology - Molecular dynamics - Molecules","Biological experiments - Cellular metabolism - Crystal diffraction - Glucose transporter-1 - Living cell membranes - Molecular dynamics simulations - Single molecule level - Transport mechanism","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: 20160520133JH, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFA0505300, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017FA044, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 2013HA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 21727816, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31330082, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21525314, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21721003, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21573217, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21673023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Prof. Stuart Lindsay for providing helpful comments and assistance.

In this method, we gather data of six kinds of solar activities (time, location, and area) and establish a multiscale transformation model for the full-disk solar image of the corresponding time. Combining both location data and area data, we design different gradient thresholds to segment different solar activities' regions. Two kinds of boundary-identification methods are used to locate and recognize solar activities' regions, respectively. Furthermore, we study the correlation of the characteristic parameters (six kinds of solar activities' data) of solar image and get the best combination of the characteristic parameters of each solar activity. The method in the paper provides precise positioning and efficient identification of solar activities, which lays the foundation for further work.

Soybean oil was added to the citrus peels fiber before high-pressure homogenization process, and the effect of four different percentages (0, 50%, 150%, and 300%) of oil to fiber on behaviors and physical properties were measured. Shear cell technique was used to measure the flowability index and powder cohesion of these powder samples. The physical properties, including particle size in suspension liquid, bulk density and scanning electron microscopy images of powder were also measured to ascertain the relationship between the structural changes and the flow property variation. The results show that the high-pressure homogenization process can change the granular structures and produce large quantities of tiny pores on the surface of the citrus fiber. Meanwhile, the particle size in suspension liquid and bulk density of powder decreased after this treatment. With the increase of the ratios of oil to fiber, the flowability index decreased and the powder cohesion increased. For the physical properties, the bulk density improved and the particle size in suspension liquid decreased; simultaneously, the number of pores on the surface of the fiber increased. Altering pressure for the high-pressure homogenization process also change the microstructure and flow properties which presented lower particle size in suspension liquid and higher bulk density.

To identify the main environmental stressors threatening the subtropical large and shallow lakes, we conducted multi-proxy sediment analyses for Lake Qilu, including the application of physio-chemical (grain size, nutrients) and biological (pigments, diatoms) indicators. Combined with modern meteorological monitoring and lake survey data, we reconstructed a two-century history of hydrodynamic changes, cyanobacteria bloom and lake eutrophication, and identified the driving factors for the succession in diatom community structure. The composition of sediment grain sizes generally remained stable until 1958 with a relatively high content of fine clays before showing frequent fluctuations and a rapid increase of coarse particles after the 1960s. The construction of a catavothre draining project led to a stronger control of water level and hydrological fluctuation in Lake Qilu, resulting in a smaller magnitude of grain size fluctuation and a lower content of sandy components during the period of 1981-2000. More recently, both lake dredging and a continuous decrease of regional precipitation caused strong fluctuations of grain size components and a higher content of sandy sediments. The sediment pigment content, an indicator for lake production, increased slowly since the middle 19th century before showing an accelerating trend after the 1960s. During the period of 2000-2005, the dredging of the shallow lake basin significantly decreased the nutrient release from lake sediments, resulting in an abrupt drop of algal production. The spike of cyanobacterial pigments may suggest the existence of massive cyanobacterial blooming in Lake Qilu around the years of 1998, 2008 and 2012-2013. Multivariate analyses further showed that diatom community composition has significantly shifted several times with a sustained decreasing trend in the percentage of benthic diatoms. While nutrient enrichment played a major role in structuring diatom assemblages over time, the anthropogenic regulation of lake hydrology and habitat availability were also found to synergistically affect the community succession of diatoms. Our multi-proxy results revealed that a combination of increased nutrient control, reduced hydrological regulation and enhanced climate mitigation should be applied altogether for sustainable management and ecological restoration of subtropical large lakes in Southwest China. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","69","Lakes","Chemical analysis - Deterioration - Economics - Eutrophication - Grain size and shape - Indicators (chemical) - Multivariant analysis - Nutrients - Phytoplankton - Sediments - Sustainable development - Tropics - Water levels - Water quality","Algal pigments - Cyanobacterial pigments - Diatoms - Hydrological regulation - Lake sediments - Meteorological monitoring - Socio-economic development - Water quality deterioration","443 Meteorology - 445.2 Water Analysis - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 922 Statistical Methods - 951 Materials Science - 971 Social Sciences",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To address both challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel method termed hetero-manifold regularisation (HMR) to supervise the learning of hash functions for efficient cross-modal search. A hetero-manifold integrates multiple sub-manifolds defined by homogeneous data with the help of cross-modal supervision information. Taking advantages of the hetero-manifold, the similarity between each pair of heterogeneous data could be naturally measured by three order random walks on this hetero-manifold. Furthermore, a novel cumulative distance inequality defined on the hetero-manifold is introduced to avoid the computational difficulty induced by the discreteness of hash codes. By using the inequality, cross-modal hashing is transformed into a problem of hetero-manifold regularised support vector learning. Therefore, the performance of cross-modal search can be significantly improved by seamlessly combining the integrated information of the hetero-manifold and the strong generalisation of the support vector machine. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed HMR achieve advantageous results over the state-of-the-art methods in several challenging cross-modal tasks. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","60","Hash functions","Information dissemination - Modal analysis","Cross-modal - cumulative distance inequality - Heterogeneous data - Information propagation - Integrated informations - Regularisation - State-of-the-art methods - Support vector learning","903.2 Information Dissemination - 921 Mathematics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Virtual water trade proves to be an increasingly useful tool in water stress alleviation for water-scarce regions, while bringing opportunities and challenges for less developed water-rich regions. In this study, Yunnan, a typical province in southwest China, was selected as the case study area to explore its potential in socio-economic development in the context of water sustainability. Both input-output analysis and structural decomposition analysis on Yunnan's water footprint for the period of 2002–2012 were performed at not only an aggregated level but also a sectoral level. Results show that although the virtual water content of all economic sectors decreased due to technological progress, Yunnan's total water footprint still increased as a result of economic scale expansion. From the sectoral perspective, sectors with large water footprints include construction sector, agriculture sector, food manufacturing & processing sector, and service sector, while metal products sector and food manufacturing & processing sector were the major virtual water exporters, and textile & clothing sector and construction sector were the major importers. Based on local conditions, policy suggestions were proposed, including economic structure and efficiency optimization, technology promotion and appropriate virtual water trade scheme. This study provides valuable insights for regions facing “resource curse” by exploring potential socio-economic progress while ensuring water security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","46","Economic analysis","Commerce - Construction industry - Economic and social effects - Manufacture - Structural optimization - Water management","Governance - Input output analysis - Structural decomposition analysis - Water footprint - Yunnan","405 Construction Equipment and Methods; Surveying - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 2017ZX07202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 17XD1401800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 16JCCS04, Acronym: SJTU, Sponsor: Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Number: 71325006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71704104, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71690241, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71603165, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was sponsored by the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment ( 2017ZX07202 ), Open Fund Program of Yunnan Key Laboratory, the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71603165 , 71690241 , 71325006 , 71704104 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities through Shanghai Jiao Tong University ( 16JCCS04 ), the Shanghai Municipal Government fund ( 17XD1401800 ), Yunnan Research Academy of Environmental Science .",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The side length of the carbon hexagon is ca. 100 nm for the honeycomb carbon (HC). For the Ni3Co1-N/HC catalysts, the NiCo nanoparticles and the nanocarbon tubes derived from dicyandiamide are uniformly dispersed on HCs. The as-synthesized Ni3Co1-N/HC catalysts exhibit efficient electroactivity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium and possess excellent tolerance to the alcohols (ethanol, n-propanol and iso-propanol). Based on these results, a membrane-less direct alcohol fuel cell has been assembled with the Ni3Co1-N/HC as the cathodic catalyst, the ternary Pd7Ag2Sn2/CNT as the anodic catalyst and alcohol (ethanol, n-propanol or iso-propanol) as the fuel. The fuel cell with the Ni3Co1-N/HC-40 as the cathodic catalyst displays the open circuit voltage of 0.79 V and maximum power density of 42.2 mW cm−2 for the ethanol fuel, 0.60 V and 33.3 mW cm−2 for the n-propanol fuel, and 0.43 V and 14.4 mW cm−2 for the iso-propanol fuel.

However, frequency drift is very common for ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID systems and will have an influence on the recovery on the physical layer. For the problem of the recovery with the frequency drift, this paper adopts a Radius Basis Function (RBF) network to separate the collision signals, and decode the signals based on FM0 code to recovery the collided RFID tags.

The binding parameters and thermodynamic parameters of pepsin-DFX complex formation suggested the presence of only one high affinity binding site in the binding process of DFX and pepsin and that the binding process was hydrogen bond dominated. According to the MD simulation optimal pepsin-DFX binding model analysis, the binding force between DFX and pepsin was mainly hydrogen bonding, and the hydrophobic interaction was supplemented. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and 3D fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the binding of DFX to pepsin had minor effect on the protein structure and function. Circular dichroism spectra showed that DFX had no significant effect on the main secondary structure of pepsin. MD analysis also showed that DFX did not affect the looseness of pepsin and the overall secondary structure, but it affected the amino acid residue sequence Leu48-Ala49-Cys50-Ser51-Asp52. Pepsin enzyme activity test showed that the addition of DFX had a slight enhancement effect on the activity of pepsin. Combined with the MD results, DFX bound to pepsin and was closer to the pepsin active site Asp-215, which may affect the electrical environment of Asp-215 residues and enhance the activity of pepsin. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","35","Biological materials","Dichroism - Enzyme activity - Fluorescence - Fluorescence spectroscopy - Ground state - Hydrogen bonds - Hydrophobicity - Spectrum analysis","3-D fluorescence spectroscopies - Circular dichroism spectra - High-affinity binding sites - Hydrophobic interactions - Secondary structures - Steady state fluorescences - Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy - Thermodynamic parameter","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: 2016xx-05, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018CP07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the Tobacco Corporation Key Technology Research on the Quality Stability of Colloidal Smokeless Tobacco Products from Major Science and Technology Special Projects of China [110201601005(2016xx-05)], and the Study on Key Technologies of Tobacco in Mouth Based on Comfort and Oral Health from Yunnan China Tobacco Industry Company Technology Development Program Project (2018CP07).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
