The results showed that the differences of physical indexes variation between the EP and the CK were similar during the process of composting. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) in the EP was lower than that in the CK at the beginning, while it was on the contrary in the end. The current study suggested that the presence of the EM microbial agent did not improve the number of OTU at the initial stage and early warming stage of aerobic composting. And, it intensified the competition with indigenous microorganisms in the piles. Furthermore, no obvious difference effects were observed between the EP and the CK. Considering the composting cost, the addition of the EM bacteria was unnecessary.

Plywood has been prepared and tested, and its performance was used to measure the wheat gluten protein hydrolysate adhesive bonding performance. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA) were used to analyze the adhesive thermal properties and the microstructures of the cured adhesives by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that modification by glutaraldehyde can effectively improve the bonding performance of wheat protein adhesives, the plywood bonded strength having been improved by its addition. The effect of PEI as a crosslinking agent became evident. It can greatly improve the bonding properties of glutaraldehyde-modified wheat protein adhesives.

These quakes are notable for producing very few aftershocks in comparison with shallow earthquakes. There are 27 earthquakes deeper than 300 km in Northeast China reported by the International Seismological Centre (ISC) from August 2010 to December 2014. However, few foreshocks or aftershocks before and after these earthquakes are documented in the ISC catalog, which is unclear that whether this is due to detection threshold by limited station distribution or different mechanisms between the deep and shallow earthquakes. In this study, we employ continuous waveform data from August 2010 to December 2014 recorded by the dense NECsaids Array (Northeast China Seismic Array to Investigate Deep Subduction) and Jilin and Heilongjiang Seismic Networks to detect the aftershock productivity of deep earthquakes by using Match & Locate (M&L) and Matched Filter methods. The well recorded waveforms for the 27 deep earthquakes in the ISC catalogue are chosen as template waveforms, meanwhile the continuous waveforms recorded by the same seismic stations are used to detect their foreshocks or aftershocks. The 27 ISC-listed deep earthquakes are self-detected successfully with maximum CC (Cross-Correlation)≈1.0. However, we don't detect any more foreshocks or aftershocks before and after the deep template earthquakes. We also relocate the deep earthquakes in Northeast China from 1966 to 2017 based on the ISC bulletin data and our phase picking data, and almost all the double-difference relocated deep earthquakes occurred within the Metastable Olivine Wedge (MOW). The about 5 km depth difference within nearby hypocenters and about 0.5 b-value for the deep earthquakes in Northeast China may indicate that these deep events are directly related to the subducting Pacific slab. © 2019, Science Press.

Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP)and compressive strength tests were used to determine the immobilization potential of arsenic in CPB. The immobilization mechanisms of arsenic in CPB were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The high compressive strength and low leaching toxicity showed that CPB had better immobilization potential of arsenic. SEM and XRD analyses showed that the formation of As-ettringite is an important immobilization mechanism of arsenic in CPB. FTIR analysis showed that AsO43- substituted SeO42- inside the ettringite in the form of HAsO42-. In the hydration process from 0 to 3 days, physical encapsulation and Ca-As precipitates were the main immobilization mechanism of arsenic. In the hydration process from 3 to 28 days, the immobilization efficiency of As-ettringite on arsenic was significantly higher than that of physical encapsulation and Ca-As precipitation.

However, the mechanisms underlying cardiac fluorosis have not been illuminated in detail. We performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on rat cardiac tissue to explore the molecular effects of NaF exposure. In total, 372 and 254 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between a group given 30 mg/L NaF and control and between a group given 90 mg/L NaF and control, respectively. The transcript levels of most of these genes were significantly down-regulated and many were distributed in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Transcriptome analysis revealed that herpes simplex infection, ECM-receptor interaction, influenza A, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, apoptosis, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway were significantly affected. IL-6 and IL-10 may play a crucial role in the cardiac damage caused by NaF as external stimuli according to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The results of qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed a marked decreased mRNA and protein levels of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 in the low concentration fluoride (LF) and high concentration fluoride (HF) groups, which was in agreement with RNA-Seq results.

The targets of LINC-PINT were verified by both luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Tumour xenografts were used to reveal the effect of LINC-PINT on tumourigenesis in vivo. We observed that LINC-PINT expression increased in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Function assays exhibited that LINC-PINT reduced NSCLC cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell migration and invasion in vitro. We also indicated that LINC-PINT mediated inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell migration and invasion by miR-208a-3p/programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) in NSCLC cells.

Abstract: Gray leaf spot, caused by Stemphylium spp., is a warm weather foliar disease in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L). Resistance against gray leaf spot is conferred by a single incompletely dominant gene (Sm) located on chromosome 11. This study aimed to map and identify molecular marker tightly linked to the Sm gene for the use of marker-assisted selection in breeding. Using an F2 population derived from a cross between the resistant line ‘9706’ and the susceptible line ‘Heinz 1706’, the Sm gene was mapped to a 185-kb interval between two markers, InDel343 and InDel-FT-32 on chromosome 11, which was consistent with the result of a genome-wide association study using 289 diverse accessions. An ORF predicted in this region was proved to be involved in Sm-mediated resistance through transient gene silencing and seems to be a good candidate of the Sm locus. To clone the Sm gene, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was screened and one BAC clone B80B15 containing the predicted ORF was identified. The analysis of sequence and structure characteristics demonstrated that the candidate gene was not a typical type resistance gene. Additionally, a co-dominant marker Sm-InDel, which produced a 122-bp or 140-bp fragment for resistant or susceptible alleles, respectively, was developed. This marker was validated in 289 germplasm and could be used in marker-assisted selection for gray leaf spot resistance. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","51","Genes","Cloning - Fruits - Plants (botany) - Samarium","Bacterial artificial chromosome libraries - Genome-wide association studies - Map-based cloning - Marker-assisted selection - Mediated resistances - Resistance genes - Solanum lycopersicum l - Structure characteristic",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The detailed mechanism of natural gas is simplified by two methods into a reduced mechanism, which are verified to prove that it can accurately predict ignition delay, laminar flame speed, temperature and pressure. The study also combines the reduced mechanism with the 95/5vv diesel mechanism to obtain a dual-fuel mechanism. This dual fuel mechanism is verified through chemical kinetics calculations, to predict the ignition delay, laminar flame speed, important free radicals and components. Furthermore, this mechanism is verified through coupling CFD, to predict that the combustion pressure and integrated heat release agreed with the experimental data. Results show that the dual-fuel mechanism displays its correctness, effectiveness and applicability. Calculations within the range of 0–60% natural gas replacement rates indicate a regular combustion sequence; at 40% replacement rate, NO emissions goes down by 6.8%, and soot emissions decrease by 92.9%.

Taking a farmland (96000m2) in Lanping County, Yunnan Province, Yunnan Province as the research object, 144 surface soil samples were collected and the contents of Pb and Cd in soil were determined by ICP-MS. The deterministic spatial interpolation method and geostatistical Kriskin interpolation method were used to investigate the accuracy of different interpolation methods and the distribution characteristics of Pb and Cd in soil. The results show that the optimal interpolation methods for heavy metals Pb and Cd in polluted farmland are 0-order ordinary Kristen interpolation method, and the content of Pb and Cd in the soil is relatively accurate.

The accuracy of such models greatly depends on the reliability of the rainfall data used. In turn, due to spatio-temporal variations in rainfall, the reliability of the rainfall data is mainly controlled by the distance between the rain gauge and the source area of the event. The high variability of rainfall events has been noted by many researchers, but detailed analysis using local rainfall data is scarce. We report here our comparison of rainfall data derived from two meteorological stations (MS.1 and MS.2) which were located at the deposition fan (1820 m.a.s.l) and source area (2400 m.a.s.l), respectively, of Touzhai Landslide in Yunnan, China. The two MSs spanned 580 m in elevation and 2.23 km in horizontal distance. Rainfall data collected hourly for a 1-year period (1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014) were analyzed. The results showed that rainfall at the two locations differed significantly. First, the vertical rainfall gradient between the two MSs was up to 187.9 mm/100 m, and the rainfall amount at MS.2 was 1.8-fold greater than that at MS.1. Second, MS.2 had both a greater amount of rainfall and a longer duration of events compared to MS.1, and high-intensity rainfall events were more frequent at MS.2. Thirdly, rainfall at the two locations was asynchronous, i.e. the rainfall at MS.2 always started earlier and ended later than that at MS.1. Both MSs showed a diurnal rainfall pattern in which it rained less during the daytime and more during the nighttime. These data revealed a negative relationship between rainfall and temperature and a positive correlation between rainfall and elevation. Based on all data together, the rainfall difference between the deposition fan and the depopulated source area of Touzhai Landslide is distinct. We conclude that in mountainous areas with a large altitude difference, rainfall data can improve the precision of rainfall threshold models only when rain gauges are sufficiently close to the source areas. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","87","Rain","Deposition - Landslides - Rain gages","Diurnal rainfall - High intensity rainfall - Meteorological station - Positive correlations - Rainfall distribution - Rainfall induced landslides - Rainfall thresholds - Spatio-temporal variation",,"Number: U1033601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; Number: U1502232, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China–Yunnan Joint Fund (U1502232, U1033601) and Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (2013531411005).

Glucosinolates as the characteristic constituents showed diverse bioactivities, especially for their anti-cancer and hepatoprotective effects. Plenty of investigation has revealed the glucosinolate contents and profiles in various Brassica vegetables (mainly on aerial parts), whereas their detailed comparison between different agroclimatic zones is rarely reported. This study aimed to make a comparison on the total glucosinolate contents (TGCs) and chemical profiles in 59 turnip landraces. The turnip tubers were obtained by collecting the seeds from four agroclimatic zones, Yunnan, Himalayas, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and Xinjiang, around southwest China and sown in Jianshui County. The TGCs in turnip were high (TGCYunnan = 0.463 ± 0.020 mg g−1 d.w., TGCHimalaya = 0.498 ± 0.019 mg g−1 d.w.) in the middle elevation environments, and decreased in both lower elevation (TGCXinjiang = 0.273 ± 0.014 mg g−1 d.w.) and higher elevation (TGCQTP = 0.346 ± 0.021 mg g−1 d.w.) environments, which followed a hump-shaped pattern along the altitudinal gradient. According to the principal component analysis, the 59 investigated landraces were dissected into two clusters, Yunnan-Himalaya environment and Xinjiang-Qinghai Tibetan Plateau environment. Significant correlation was observed between the aboveground biomass and underground biomass (r = 0.653, p warm and humid = 0.467 ± 0.014 mg g−1 d.w.)] is profitable for the accumulation of glucosinolates, as compared to the arid and stressful environment [e.g. QTP and Xinjiang areas (TGCarid and stressful = 0.329 ± 0.014 mg g−1 d.w.)].

Compared with traditional solvent extraction technology, PIM is especially suitable for the separation of low concentration gold(I). A PIM containing [A336][SCN] as the carrier, polyvinylidene difluoride as a polymer matrix, and 2-nitrophenyl n-octyl ether as the plasticizer was prepared using solvent volatilization and characterized by several techniques. In addition, effects of several experimental factors on the extraction and recovery efficiencies were studied; the experimental factors included the concentration of the extractant, the stirring rate, the species of the polymer matrix, the initial gold concentration in the feed solution, and the KSCN concentration in the strip solution. Results revealed that the membrane composition and in particular, the carrier concentration, significantly affect the extraction of gold(I). The extraction mechanism involved an anion exchange reaction between the carrier [A336][SCN] embedded in the matrix polymer and the gold cyanide complex in the feed phase, followed by diffusion through the PIM, and Au(CN)2− is eventually recovered in the stripping phase.

Inspired by the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to image-to-image task, we propose a novel FuseGAN to fulfill the images-to-image for multi-focus image fusion. To satisfy the requirement of dual input-to-one output, the encoder of the generator in FuseGAN is designed as a Siamese network. The least square GAN objective is employed to enhance the training stability of FuseGAN, resulting in an accurate confidence map for focus region detection. Also, we exploit the convolutional conditional random fields technique on the confidence map to reach a refined final decision map for better focus region detection. Moreover, due to the lack of a large-scale standard dataset, we synthesize a large enough multi-focus image dataset based on a public natural image dataset PASCAL VOC 2012, where we utilize a normalized disk point spread function to simulate the defocus and separate the background and foreground in the synthesis for each image. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the proposed method presents accurate decision maps for focus regions in multi-focus images, such that the fused images are superior to 11 recent state-of-the-art algorithms, not only in visual perception, but also in quantitative analysis in terms of five metrics. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","56","Image fusion","Convolution - Image processing - Large dataset - Optical transfer function - Random processes","Adversarial networks - Conditional random field - images-to-image - Multifocus image fusion - synthesize dataset","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model, the research team completed 3,724 field fissure measurements in the study area. The fracture measurement results were analyzed using the GEOFRAC method and the whole-area fracture network data were generated. On this basis, the rock mass permeability coefficient tensor of the aquifer in the study area was calculated. The tensor calculation results are used in the numerical model of groundwater flow. After calculation, the obtained numerical model can better represent the groundwater seepage field in the study area. In addition, we designed three different numerical models for calculation, mainly to explore the influence of the tensor assignment of permeability coefficient on the calculation results of water yield of the mine.

At present, power transformers, lightning arresters, and other equipment have on-line methods to detect the insulation state. However, there is no mature method for the on-line monitoring of voltage transformer winding insulation. In this study, a small current disturbance method based on a zero-sequence loop is proposed. The characteristic parameters of the low-frequency oscillation of zero-sequence voltage after a disturbance are used to evaluate the insulation state of the winding and detect faults. Theoretical modeling, simulation tests, and field tests show that when the insulation resistance of the voltage transformer winding is in the range 0–40 k, a low frequency oscillation of about 10 Hz can be detected on the zero-sequence voltage, and its amplitude and duration are proportional to the degree of damage to the insulation. This can hence be used as a criterion for the on-line detection of voltage transformer winding insulation defects. © 2019 by the authors.","22","Electric transformer testing","Damage detection - Defects - Electric insulation testing - Electric wiring - Insulation - Lightning protection - Power transformers - Transformer windings - Winding","Current disturbances - Insulation degradation - Insulation resistance - Low frequency oscillations - On-line detection - Theoretical modeling - Voltage transformer - Zero sequence voltage","413 Insulating Materials - 691.2 Materials Handling Methods - 704.1 Electric Components - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 951 Materials Science","Number: YNKJ00000045, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: YNKJXM20170214, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; ","This research was funded by Yunnan electric power corporation of China (YNKJXM20170214; YNKJ00000045).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Because of its porosity, large specific surface area, rich oxygen-containing functional groups, rich minerals and strong stability, biochar has been widely used in the remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils. The passivation effect of biochar on heavy metals is affected by not only the properties of heavy metals and biochar, but also organic acids secreted from plant rhizosphere in soil. However, the effects of organic acids on biochar-heavy metal interactions have not been studied limitedly. Therefore, in this paper, oxalic acid and citric acid were chosen as organic acids to explore the mechanisim on the adsorption behavior change of Pb(II) on biochars (different pyrolysis temperatures at 200, 300, 400and 500). Comparing with the Freundlich model, the Langmuir model was more suitable for fitting the adsorption data of Pb(II) on two types of biocharsi.e peanut shell biocarsand pine biochars. The peanut shell biocars prepared at 200 had maximum adsorption capacityon Pb(II). The process of Pb(II) adsorption by biocharswas spontaneous, the adsorption stability of peanut shell biocars was stronger than pine biochars, and the adsorption stability decreased as pyrolysis temperature increased. When the concentration of citric acid and oxalic acid was below 2.60×10-2mmol/L and7.65×10-2mmol/L respectively, the adsorbed organic acids would provide more binding sites for Pb(II), thus promoting the adsorption of Pb(II). When the concentration of organic acids increased, the internal pores of biochars may be occupied by the organic acids, which would compet for the binding sites of heavy metals and thereby inhibite the adsorption of Pb(II) on biochars. This study will provide important basic information for systematically understanding the environmental effects of biochars, and will help to comprehensively evaluate the function of biochars in environmental remediation in the presence of organic acids. © 2019, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

This paper first introduces the evolution of GIS technology. As the third generation language of geography, GIS is a comprehensive application system developed in the last 50 years. Internationally, GIS began to be used in agriculture in the 1970s. It has been applied in land resource survey, land resource evaluation, and management analysis of agricultural resource information. After the 1990s, the application of GIS in the field of agriculture has been deepened and popularized. It is mainly used in the followings, such as the regional agricultural sustainable development research, land crop suitability evaluation, agricultural production information management, farmland soil erosion and protection research, land agricultural productive potential research, agricultural system imitation and simulation research, integrated of modern high-tech 'precision agriculture' research and application, agro-ecosystem monitoring and quantitative research, investigation, planning and management of farmland and agricultural input-output benefits and environmental protection research, forest pest control, etc. In China, in the mid-1980s, GIS began to be applied to the agricultural field including land and resources decision management, agricultural resource information, regional agricultural planning, grain distribution management and food production assisted decision-making, agricultural production potential research, crop yield estimation research, regional agricultural sustainable development research, agricultural land suitability evaluation, agro-ecological environment monitoring, and research on precision agricultural information processing systems based on GPS and GIS, which have made great achievements. Some research results have been directly applied to agricultural production and great economic benefits have been obtained. This paper focuses on the specific application research of GIS technology on agricultural resource information management, agroclimatic zoning, agricultural disaster prevention, agro-ecological environment management, precision agriculture, crop yield estimation and monitoring, soil erosion, ecological sensitivity and non-point source pollution, etc. The research believes that the application of '3S' integration technology, the integration of integrated agricultural expert system (ES) combined with GIS, and the application of portable mobile GIS are the main trend of modern agriculture development of GIS technology under the background of today's informatization and networking. © 2019 IEEE.","14","Geographic information systems","Agriculture - Applications - Crops - Decision making - Disaster prevention - Disasters - Ecology - Environmental management - Erosion - Expert systems - Farms - Information management - Information use - Planning - Precision agriculture - Research and development management - Soil conservation - Sustainable development - Zoning","Agricultural disasters - Agricultural informations - Agricultural productions - Agricultural resources - Ecological environments - Integration technologies - Non-point source pollution - Research and application","451.2 Air Pollution Control - 454 Environmental Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 723.4.1 Expert Systems - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 912.2 Management - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The performance of particleboards prepared at a press temperature of 230 °C, 200 °C and 180 °C and a press time of 8 min, 10 min and 12 min was tested and evaluated. The structure of the oligomers obtained was detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Thermomechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were also used to analyze their behavior. The particleboards bonded with the S-NIPU adhesive at 230 °C showed excellent properties, which, however, decreased as the press time was reduced. The silane coupling agent used as a crosslinking promoter significantly reduced the curing temperature of the adhesive and allowed to obtain good bonding at a lower press temperature. The results obtained confirmed that coupling the S-NIPU adhesive with a silane used as a crosslinking promoter can yield sufficiently improved results to function as a suitable adhesive for particleboard, medium density fiberboard and other types of particulate wood panels.

This method also uses oxygen carriers (mainly metal oxides and calcium sulfate) to transfer heat and oxygen to the fuel. In this work, we used phosphogypsum (PG) as the oxygen carrier in CLG with lignite fuel. Based on experimental and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation analysis, the Ca and S migration characteristics in PG and the reaction mechanism between lignite fuel molecules and the oxygen carrier PG in CLG were explored. The results show that there is a series of tandem and competitive reactions during this process, and the optimal temperature range of the fuel reactor in the chemical looping gasification of PG oxygen carriers is 1173 K–1223 K. The only gaseous sulfide detected is H2S, and the solid sulfide CaS and a small amount of unreacted CaSO4 are detected at a temperature of 1173 K. DFT calculation shows that the presence of S+6 atoms from SO42− on the top of the CaSO4 surface is more favourable than Ca2+ for C, CO, and H2 oxidation at a temperature of 1173 K. During oxidation, lattice O consumption mainly occurs around the S+6 atoms stepwise from S+6 → S−2 at a temperature of 1173 K. In addition, CO and H2 oxidation occur more easily than that of C at a temperature of 1173 K. The experimental results and the calculated results show good consistency, providing valuable information regarding the reactivity of the oxygen carrier PG and the C, CO, and H2 oxidation over the CaSO4 surface at an atomic level. © 2019","45","Calcium compounds","Atoms - Combustion - Density functional theory - Fuels - Gasification - Gypsum - Lignite - Oxidation - Sulfur compounds","Chemical looping - Chemical-looping combustion - Competitive reactions - Density functional theory methods - Migration mechanisms - Optimal temperature - Phosphogypsum - Theoretical calculations","482.2 Minerals - 524 Solid Fuels - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: 21666016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial support for this project was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21666016 ), which is greatly acknowledged.

The performance of the separation is controlled primarily by the internal flow in the separator, governed by the process and machine settings. However, these factors change with the properties of the magnetic material and the operating conditions. Therefore, the numerical calculation of the multiphysics coupling separation process of such dynamic captures becomes crucial for wet LIMS. In this study, we present a novel and straightforward fully coupled multiphysics modeling approach for the simulation of LIMS. In this model, particle tracing in the fluid flow module is used to calculate the location and dynamic capture behavior of ferromagnetic particles under the determined magnetic and flow fields. In particular, while calculating the magnetic force, hydrodynamic drag force, gravity, and centrifugal force, the model also inherently retains its ability to simulate the influence of ferromagnetic–particle–fluid interactions. The model is compared with experiments and the particle capture theory, and is demonstrated to be realistic for studying ferromagnetic suspensions in mineral processing applications. The model provides new possibilities to understand and predict the efficiency of mineral separation processes through detailed computational simulations of the effects of the respective operating conditions on the dynamic capture behavior of the particles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","24","Suspensions (fluids)","Computation theory - Drag - Ferromagnetic materials - Ferromagnetism - Flow of fluids - Magnetic bubbles - Magnetic separation - Minerals","Computational simulation - Ferromagnetic particles - Hydrodynamic drag forces - Low intensity magnetic separations - Multi-physics couplings - Multi-physics modeling - Numerical calculation - Particle-fluid interaction","482.2 Minerals - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.4 Magnetic Materials - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 804 Chemical Products Generally","Number: 51764023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge and appreciate the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51764023).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The chromaticity coordinates and the correlated color temperature (CCT) of SGO: Dy3+ phosphors with different Dy3+ concentrations are close with an optimal doping at 4.00 mol% Dy3+ for chromaticity coordinate (0.4269, 0.4348) and a lowest CCT of 3361 K. The perfect weatherability of this phosphor was also confirmed since the phosphorescence intensity and the color were stable at high temperature and in a high humidity environment. The performance obtained shows that SGO: Dy3+ is a suitable candidate for illumination sources that are beneficial to human health. © 2019 The American Ceramic Society","45","Light emitting diodes","Color - Crystal structure - Defects - Light - Luminescence - Phosphors","Chromaticity coordinates - Correlated color temperature - High-humidity environment - Luminescence properties - Luminescent characteristics - Phosphorescence intensity - Thermoluminescence properties - White light emitting diodes","714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2016FB081, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: KKSY201632046, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 11774138, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11774138, 11664022, 51862020, 11804255, and 11664022), the Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FA021 and 2016FB081), and the project for personal training fun supported by Kunming University of Science and Technology (KKSY201632046).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Structures, electrical and magnetic properties of obtained LCSMO ceramics were investigated by various analytical techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) identified structures of all ceramics as pure perovskite LCSMO phase with Pnma space group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed improvements in surface compactness and homogeneity of LCSMO ceramics prepared at various T s. As T s rose, resistivity (ρ) dropped and both peak temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and magnetoresistance (MR) increased. This, in turn, improved crystalline quality and microstructure of LCSMO ceramics. For LCSMO ceramics sintered at 1673 K, the TCR and MR peaks reached maxima of 4.15% (294.5 K) and 17.4% (296.7 K), respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested no change in La, Ca and Sr, indicative of stable proportion of Mn3+ and Mn4+. The increase in T s caused lattice distortion and suppressed double exchange (DE) interaction. The latter changed the metal to insulator transition temperature (T p) of the materials. Overall, room-temperature (295-300 K) electrical and magnetic properties of LCSMO ceramics could significantly be enhanced by increasing T s. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","44","Ceramic materials","Magnetic properties - Magnetism - Manganese oxide - Metal insulator transition - Perovskite - Scanning electron microscopy - Sintering - Sol-gel process - Sol-gels - Structure (composition) - Temperature - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Crystalline quality - Double exchange interactions - Electrical and magnetic property - La0.625 (Ca0.315Sr0.06) MnO3 - Lattice distortions - Metal-to-insulator transitions - Polycrystalline ceramics - Sintering temperatures","482.2 Minerals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 812.1 Ceramics - 812.3 Glass - 951 Materials Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The photoanode was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal and microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach. The experimental results show that the photocurrent density and light harvesting of the PFC increase significantly. The enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of heterojunction at the photoanode resulting in reduction in the interface charge carrier recombination at the NiFe-LDH/BiVO4 junction and lower bandgap energy compared with bare BiVO4. The photocurrent density of the NiFe-LDH/BiVO4 is 90% higher than that of bare BiVO4 using Na2SO3 as the hole scavenger for substrate and 1 M phosphate buffer solution as the supporting electrolyte. The enhanced BiVO4 works as an efficient photoanode in PFC. The open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and actual maximum power density of the NiFe-LDH/BiVO4-Cu2O/Cu PFC are 0.647 V, 0.196 mA cm−2 and 74 µW cm−2, respectively.

The identification of the critical mass flux (G0) at which the flow characteristic transits from positive to negative is important for design of supercritical boilers with vertical water wall. In this paper, theoretical analysis was performed to investigate G0 under both supercritical and subcritical pressures. A theoretical solution of G0 was derived through thermal-hydraulic models. The impacts of operation parameters and tube structure parameters on G0 were quantified through numerical analysis. The results show that fluid outlet temperature, fluid pressure, tube inner diameter and tube friction factor have significant impacts on G0. G0 decreases as the increase of the fluid outlet temperature and the decrease of the fluid pressure. Under the condition of identical fluid inlet and outlet temperatures, operating pressure and tube length, G0 is proportional to D/λ.

As a powerful tool, ontology is evenly employed in various subjects, such as neuroscience, medical science, pharmacopedia, chemistry, education and other social science. Ontology similarity measuring plays a vital role in practical implementations since essential issues of ontology mapping are also similarity calculating. In ontology function learning, one learns a real valued score function that assigns scores to each ontology vertex which corresponds to a concept. Thus, the similarity between vertices is determined by means of the absolute value of difference between their corresponding scores. In this paper, we report the new optimization algorithms for obtaining ontology function in view of ontology sparse vector learning. The implementation of ontology algorithms is mainly based on iterative calculation in which we consider the whole matrix version of framework and ontology sparse vector are updated in each iterative. The data results obtained from four simulation experiments reveal that our newly proposed ontology approach has high efficiency and accuracy in biology and plant science with regard to ontology similarity measure, and humanoid robotics and education science with regard to ontology mapping. © 2019, International Association of Engineers.

Besides, the discharge characteristics of CF3I gas before and after arc are compared by employing the Boltzmann equation method with two-term approximation. The results show that, the gaseous composition of CF3I gas after high current arc is mainly fluorocarbon, while the solids are iodine and carbon elementary substance. The decomposing ratio of CF3I gas after successful interruption is extremely low, and the insulation strength is even higher than that of the original gas.

However, the ideal electrocatalysts are noble metal based catalysts. Their high cost and scarcity in earth seriously restrict the large deployments. NiFe-based materials have attracted great attention in recent years due to their excellent catalytic properties for OER and HER. Nevertheless, their conductivity and electrochemical stability at high current density are unsatisfactory, resulting in ineffective water splitting due to high impedance and low stability. Recently, a series of catalysts coating NiFe-based materials on 3D nickel foam were found to be extremely stable under the circumstance of high current density.

Amongst all components in this platform, the modularization mechanism addresses key issue in the design process of manufacturing product. However, the traditional modular methods only solve the modularization with single one or several objectives. In this paper, a novel hierarchical collaborative method based on multi-objective optimization is developed for modularization of product platform, which is integrated various of modular standards, including the product structure, product function, design of products, assembly of products and so on, and trades off the contradiction of these standards to achieve the optimal modularization with multiple hierarchical objectives. Moreover, for solutions to this method, a hierarchical collaborative multi-objective optimization algorithm, the Hierarchical Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (H-NSGA), is developed to optimize the modularization with multilevel objectives. Furthermore, an industrial case illustrates the details of the proposed model and algorithm. Finally, the experimental comparison demonstrates that the hierarchical collaborative method and the hierarchical multi-objective optimization algorithm can achieve efficient modular solutions with multiple hierarchical objectives. © 2019 IEEE.","13","Multiobjective optimization","Genetic algorithms - Interactive computer systems - Manufacture - Modular construction - Product design","Experimental comparison - Hierarchical collaborative method - Manufacturing industries - Manufacturing products - Model and algorithms - Modularizations - Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms - Product platforms","405.2 Construction Methods - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 913.1 Production Engineering - 913.4 Manufacturing - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The effect of two completely different catalysts (a basic catalyst: CaO, and an acidic catalyst: HZSM-5) on pyrolysis characteristics and the composition of pyrolysis vapors, as well as aromatic selectivity, were studied. A characteristic analysis of catalysts (using XRD, BET, FTIR, NH3-TPD and SEM), the effect of catalytic temperature, the CaO to HZSM-5 ratio and the biomass to catalyst ratio on the distribution of products were also investigated and analyzed. Coke formation and deposition mechanisms and the relationship between the formation and characteristics of the coke and the deactivation of the catalyst were also demonstrated. The results demonstrate that the pyrolysis characteristics of the biomass were changed by the addition of CaO (bond breaking) and HZSM-5 (deoxygenation) catalysts, causing the solid residue rate to increase significantly, the maximum weight loss rate to decrease and the biomass conversion rate to increase. The order of the activity of the catalysts is HZSM-5 > CaO/HZSM-5 > CaO; at the same time, characteristic parameters such as activation energy, activation enthalpy, activation entropy and the steric parameter increased significantly at the expense of the reaction ratio. Moreover, CaO mixed with HZSM-5 catalyst can improve the gas content and aromatic hydrocarbon content significantly. However, the content of bio-oil decreased slightly, and the maximum aromatic content was 72 wt% of peak area of that for pure HZSM-5 catalyst (69 wt% of peak area) at a pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C and a catalytic temperature of 550 °C. The ratio of CaO to HZSM-5 was 1:2, and the biomass to catalyst ratio was 1:2. In addition, the selectivities with toluene and xylene were 27% and 35%, respectively.

Most of the stilbenes showed obvious inhibition on PTP1B and α-glucosidase, superior to the monoterpene glycosides. Especially, the stilbene tetramer (1) and trimer (8) exhibited high activity inhibiting both PTP1B with IC50 values of 27.23 and 27.81 μM and α-glucosidase with IC50 values of 13.57 and 14.39 μM. Two trans-dimers (4 and 5) also showed dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV) inhibitory activity (55.35% and 61.26%, 500 μM) in addition to PTP1B and α-glucosidase.

A parametric shared conjoined triple deep learning model is used, which is suitable for trace features and optimizing the triplet selection and data augmentation strategies. This system is trained by minimizing a triplet loss function, so that a similarity measure is defined by the L2 distance in this embedding.

Manifold regularized semi-supervised learning (MRSSL) thus received intensive attention recently because it successfully exploits the local structure of data distribution including both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage the generalization ability of a learning model. Although there are many representative works in MRSSL, including Laplacian regularization (LapR) and Hessian regularization, how to explore and exploit the local geometry of data manifold is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a fully efficient approximation algorithm of graph p-Laplacian, which significantly saving the computing cost. And then we propose p-LapR (pLapR) to preserve the local geometry. Specifically, p-Laplacian is a natural generalization of the standard graph Laplacian and provides convincing theoretical evidence to better preserve the local structure. We apply pLapR to support vector machines and kernel least squares and conduct the implementations for scene recognition. Extensive experiments on the Scene 67 dataset, Scene 15 dataset, and UC-Merced dataset validate the effectiveness of pLapR in comparison to the conventional manifold regularization methods. © 2018 IEEE.","36","Learning algorithms","Approximation algorithms - Automobile engine manifolds - Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions - Geometry - Laplace equation - Laplace transforms - Standards - Supervised learning - Uranium compounds","Laplacian regularizations - Manifold learning - P-Laplacian - Scene recognition - Semi- supervised learning - Semi-supervised learning (SSL)",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this study, we report a novel methodology for powerfully promoting the N doping amounts in three-dimensional (3D) Fe3C-embedded N and P-co-doped porous carbon hybrid nanowires (i.e. Fe3C@NP-PCFs). Via pyrolysis of the 3D polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-cyanamide-Fe(C2H3O2)2-H3PO4 precursor networks woven by the electrospinning technology, the desired products were successfully synthesized. In the pyrolysis process, upon the activation of phosphoric acid, the surfaces of the 3D Fe3C@NP-PCF networks in situ formed abundant micro/mesopores and high-density carbon edges/defects, which contributed towards the instantaneous doping of more N atoms (9.26 at%) into the carbon frameworks of Fe3C@NP-PCFs. The resultant Fe3C@NP-PCF catalyst displayed highest ORR activity, comparable to that of 20 wt% Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH. In particular, the Fe3C@NP-PCF catalyst revealed excellent ORR activity with the onset potential and half-wave potential being just 10.1 mV and 27.7 mV more negative than those of 20 wt% Pt/C, respectively. Its limited diffusion current density was even much larger than that of 20 wt% Pt/C in 0.5 M H2SO4. The electrochemical measurement results show that the Fe3C@NP-PCFs catalyst also possesses better durability and methanol tolerance than 20 wt% Pt/C in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The special 3D hierarchically porous structures of the Fe3C@NP-PCF nanowires and the fairly high active site dispersion along their surfaces are responsible for the excellent ORR activity of this catalyst. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","34","Catalyst activity","Carbon - Electrolytes - Electrolytic reduction - Nanowires - Nitrogen - Oxygen - Phosphorus - Porous materials - Potassium hydroxide - Pyrolysis","Alkaline electrolytes - Catalytic efficiencies - Electrochemical measurements - Hierarchically porous - Nitrogen and phosphorus - Non-precious metal catalysts - Oxygen reduction reaction - Threedimensional (3-d)","761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2018T20170019, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support received from the scienti&#57603;c research start-up fund from Kunming University of Science and Technology of introducing talents (130214119417) and the analysis and test fund received from the Kunming University of Science and Technology (2018T20170019).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

NSST has many advantages such as multi-scale features and sparse representation. Moreover, the visual saliency map can improve the low frequency fusion strategy, and SCM has coupling and pulse synchronization properties. Firstly, NSST is utilized to decompose the source image into a low-frequency subband and a series of high-frequency subbands. Secondly, the low-frequency subband is fused by SCM, where SCM is motivated by the edge saliency map of the low-frequency subband of the source image, and then the high-frequency subbands are also fused by SCM, where the modified spatial frequency of the high-frequency subbands of the source image is adopted as the input stimulus of SCM, the parameters of SCM are optimized by the novel multi-objective artificial bee colony technique. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by inverse NSST.

The results of this study provide a scientific basis for the rational use of water resources in this region. The results showed that there were 3953 glaciers with a total area of 1306.45 km2 and ice volume of ~58.16 km3 in the Gangdisê Mountains during 2015-2016. The glaciers in sizes of 0.1-5 km2 and 2 had the largest area and the greatest number of glaciers in the Gangdisê Mountains, respectively. In the past five decades, the area of glaciers decreased by 854.05 km2 (-1.09%/a), accounting for 39.53% of the total area of glaciers in the region in 1970. The increase of temperature in the ablation period was the most important cause of glacier retreat. Compared to other mountains in western China, the Gangdisê Mountains was the region with the strongest glacier retreat and had an accelerating tendency in recent years. The decrease of glacier area was mainly concentrated at elevations of 5600-6100 m a.s.l. and there was no change in elevation above 6500 m a.s.l. in the Gangdisê Mountains. Except for the south and southeast orientations, the number and area of glaciers were decreasing in all the orientations. Specifically, the north orientation suffered the largest area loss of glaciers and the northwest orientation witnessed the fastest retreat of glacier area. A significant feature of spatial variation showed that the rate of glacier retreat was faster from west to east in the Gangdisê Mountains. The relative change of glacier rate in the eastern section was high at -1.72%/a, followed by the middle section (-1.67%/a), and that in the western section was only -0.83%/a. © 2019, Science Press.

In this study, we found that IL-33 treatment evidently repressed tumour growth, induced CD4+ T cells infiltration and IL-17 expression in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Notably, IL-33 treatment increased the number of Dendritic Cells (DCs) in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. More importantly, IL-33 induced maturation and regulated the function of DCs by increasing expression of DCs mature markers (CD40 and CD80, CD86) DCs-function-related gene including antigen presentation genes (HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB and CD74) and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that IL-33 treatment induced DCs maturation by upregulating CYLD expression in DCs. In addition, CYLD played an important role in DCs-induced T cell proliferation and IL-17 secretion. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that IL-33 mediated immunoregulation in pulmonary adenocarcinoma by improving DC-induced T cell proliferation by upregulating CYLD expression. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In the process of improving the thermal path model of oil-immersed transformers and improving the accuracy of their models, the determination of thermal resistance parameters of insulating paper is particularly critical. In order to analyze the case that the insulating paper and the copper contact interface are filled with the transformer oil, we observed the microstructures of insulating paper and copper surface by atomic force microscopy.According to the observation data, the contact thermal resistance model was improved, and the contact thermal resistance between the oil-impregnated insulation paper and the copper at different temperatures was calculated. Therefore, we improved the dual heat flow meter method and tested the contact thermal resistance of copper and oil-impregnated insulation paper at different temperatures. The results show that the thermal resistance of copper and oil-impregnated insulation paper at 70 is calculated to be 0.000 541 m2•K/W and is tested to be 0.000 575 m2•K/W. As the temperature increases, the thermal conductivity of the oil-impregnated insulating paper decreases, and the thermal resistance of the contact between the copper and the oil-impregnated insulating paper becomes large.

Due to the increasing population, the number of residential areas, schools, hospitals and other facilities is increasing, and unreasonable distribution will inevitably take place. The main purpose of urban planning is to coordinate the specific arrangement of urban spatial layout and various concrete construction by rationally utilizing the urban land according to the determined nature, scale and development direction of the city. From this point of view, by planning the city to make the population of the city rationally distributed, and fully analyzing the factors of people's gathering according to the existing layout of the city, these elements can be planned and constructed in a centralized manner so as to solve the problems of transportation, environment, etc. in the city.

Existing approaches in this field only take into account the clique instances where feature instances form a clique. However, they may neglect some important spatial correlations among features in practice. In this paper, we introduce star participation instances to measure the prevalence of co-location patterns such that spatially correlated instances which cannot form cliques will also be properly considered. Then we propose a new concept called sub-prevalent co-location patterns (SPCP) based on the star participation instances. Furthermore, two efficient algorithms -- the prefix-tree-based algorithm (PTBA) and the partition-based algorithm (PBA) -- are proposed to mine all the maximal sub-prevalent co-location patterns (MSPCP) in a spatial data set. PTBA uses a typical candidate generate-and-test way starting from candidates with the longest pattern-size, while PBA adopts a step-by-step manner starting from 3-size core patterns.

GO with a higher degree of oxidation (C:O = 1.98) corresponds to lower defect (ID: IG = 0.63), which indicates the advantage of low temperature oxidation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further indicates that the C-O content of GO prepared by one-step oxidation at a lower temperature is higher than that of the conventional method, which is about 10%. After GO is in situ reduced by aluminum powder at room temperature, an extremely high ID:IG ratio of 1.82 was observed. The as-prepared reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is located in the stage 1 of Ferrari and corresponding average defect distance exceeds 6.8 nm. The dielectric properties of GO and rGO are investigated at 2.45 GHz. The dielectric parameters of GO was negatively correlated to the degree of oxidation. The dielectric constant of rGO increases from 13.3 to 118.2 as the temperature increases from room temperature to 800 °C. However, the dielectric loss of rGO is reduced from 0, 03 to 0.025 and then increased to 0.032. The theoretical reflection loss (RL) of the rGO sample suggest that the maximum microwave absorption with the reflection losses of -26.67 dB can be obtained.

In this work, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry were used for traceability of 312 mushroom samples from eight different geographical origins in combination with multivariate statistical analysis. Initially, FT-IR, UV spectra, and 14 elements of 312 samples obtained from 8 geographical origins were analyzed, respectively. Meanwhile, the principal components of three techniques were extracted by principal components analysis for data fusion. Finally, classification models were established in the basis of UV, FT-IR, elements, and fusion datasets combined with support vector machine (SVM). Compared with individual technology, data fusion of multi-technique can obviously promote the classification performance in SVM models for geographical origins traceability. Especially, the accuracy of prediction in SVM model by data fusion of three instruments was 99.04%, which was higher than single technique and data fusion of two spectroscopies techniques. This result indicated that data fusion strategy combined with SVM can provide high synergic effect for geographical origins traceability of Boletaceae mushrooms.

Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. Aims. We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. Methods. We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.′′4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. Results. A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OH and H2CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 Mo, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s-1 pc-1, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales (∼1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are 0.05 Mo yr-1, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 Mo yr-1. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a 'damp' merger. Conclusions. The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster. © ESO 2019.","54","Signal to noise ratio","Blending - Gases - Giant stars - Kinematics - Molecular structure","ISM: individual objects - ISM: Kinematics and dynamics - Radio lines: ISM - Stars: formation - Stars: massive - Techniques: high angular resolutions","657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics","Number: ALMA-ARC 05A11PK3, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: C3, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NASA, Sponsor: National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Number: -, Acronym: ESO, Sponsor: European Southern Observatory; Number: NSC, Acronym: NRC, Sponsor: National Rehabilitation Center; Number: -, Acronym: KASI, Sponsor: Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute; Number: -, Acronym: NINS, Sponsor: National Institutes of Natural Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Sleep Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: JPL, Sponsor: Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Number: -, Acronym: Caltech, Sponsor: California Institute of Technology; ","Acknolw edgements.

In this study, by coupling the competitive gaseous adsorptions and multiple reaction pathways via a state-to-state microkinetic formalism, we reveal CO oxidation mechanisms on small Pd ensembles under realistic experimental conditions. It is found that reaction of O2 with preadsorbed CO on adjacent Pd sites is the dominant pathway at low temperatures (denoted as the preadsorbed CO oxidation pathway, or PCOP). As the temperature increases, different PCOPs dominate CO oxidation. At even higher temperatures, the CO oxidation reaction proceeds primarily via the recombination of dissociated O atoms and CO (denoted as the dissociated O2 pathway, or DO2P). Among different ensembles investigated, the Pd dimer possesses the best low-temperature CO oxidation activity, while the tetramer outperforms other forms at higher temperatures. It is concluded that oxygen adsorption ability is the main factor influencing the reactivity.
