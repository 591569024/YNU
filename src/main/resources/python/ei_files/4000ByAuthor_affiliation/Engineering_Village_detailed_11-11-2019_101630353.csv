Specifically, to reduce the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks, it is assumed that the signal is not transmitted at each instant and the transmission process is stochastic. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing discrete-time Jensen’s inequality, a new set of sufficient conditions is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities such that the augmented filtering system is stochastically finite-time bounded with a prescribed dissipative performance level. Meanwhile, the desired dissipative-based filter gain matrices can be determined by solving an optimization problem. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and the less conservatism of the proposed filter design technique. Copyright © 2018 R.

According to the change of cooling load, the method adjusts the cooling capacity supply in time based on the model of heat balance in air-conditioned rooms, and sets the switching boundary conditions of switchable pump input and exit switching automatically. At the same time, the influences of indoor temperature setting, water supply temperature and fresh air ratio on energy saving effect is analyzed. Several control strategies are put forward, such as water pump group control, reasonable temperature setting, new air ratio regulation, transition season air supply scheme and so on, which realize optimal control of pumps in chilled water system.

In conventional IDs, both probabilities representing beliefs and utilities representing preferences of decision makers are precise point-valued parameters. However, it is usually difficult or even impossible to directly provide such parameters. In this paper, we extend conventional IDs to allow IDs with interval-valued parameters (IIDs) and develop a counterpart method of Copper's evaluation method to evaluate IIDs. IIDs avoid the difficulties attached to the specification of precise parameters and provide the capability to model decision-making processes in a situation that the precise parameters cannot be specified. The counterpart method to Copper's evaluation method reduces the evaluation of IIDs into inference problems of Bayesian networks with interval-valued probabilities. An algorithm based on the approximate inference of Bayesian networks with interval-valued probabilities is proposed, and extensive experiments are conducted. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can find the optimal strategies effectively in IIDs, and the interval-valued expected utilities obtained by proposed algorithm are contained in those obtained by exact evaluating algorithms. The newly development approach would significantly extend the range of IDs for managerial decision support applications where parameters of variables can be specifically defined by only estimated intervals.

For top-emitting OLEDs, however, Mg:Ag cathodes in the AgMg3–Mg region show large imaginary refractive index, and thus a stacked Mg:Ag/Ag is found essential to achieve optimal device performance. Furthermore, insertion of a thin LiF layer is found to create an effective charge injection cathode.

In this study, a map of the current distribution of vegetation in Yunnan Province was compiled based on data from remote sensing imagery from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) from 2008 to 2011. A classification and regression tree (CART) model was used to predict the potential distribution of the main forest vegetation types in Yunnan Province and estimate the changes in carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) in response to increasing temperature. The results show that the current total forest area in Yunnan Province is 1.86 × 107ha and that forest covers 48.63% of the area. As the temperature increases, the area of forest distribution first increases and then decreases, and it decreases by 11% when the temperature increases from 1.5 to 2 °C. The mean carbon density of the seven types of forest vegetation in Yunnan Province is 84.69 Mg/ha. The total carbon storage of the current forest vegetation in Yunnan Province is 871.14 TgC, and the CSP is 1100.61 TgC. The largest CSP (1114.82 TgC) occurs when the temperature increases by 0.5 °C. Incremental warming of 2 °C will sharply decrease the forest CSP, especially in those regions with mature coniferous forest vegetation. Semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forests were highly sensitive to temperature changes, and the CSP of these forests will decrease with increasing temperature. Warm-hot coniferous forests have the greatest CSP in all simulation scenarios except the scenario of a 2 °C temperature increase. These results indicate that temperature increases can influence the CSP in Yunnan Province, and the largest impact emerged in the 2 °C increase scenario. © 2018 by the author.","89","Forestry","Carbon capture - Climate change - Digital storage - Remote sensing - Satellite imagery - Temperature - Vegetation","Carbon sequestration potential - Carbon storage - CART models - Forest vegetation - Temperature increase","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 655.2 Satellites - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques","Number: 31770528, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1602234, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We gratefully acknowledge the students and staffof the Institute of Ecology and Geobotany of Yunnan University for assisting with the fieldwork and interpretation of vegetation.

Although existing allocation mechanisms allocate VMs to users through the single-mapping mechanism, such allocations cannot guarantee maximum social welfare or efficient utilization of multiple types of resources for cloud providers. Thus, we consider the multi-mapping mechanism, which permits mapping VMs allocated to one user to physical machines for VM provisioning and allocation. This can result in improved social welfare and lead to less resource fragmentation. We formulate the HPMRM problem in an auction-based setting, and design optimal and approximate mechanisms to solve it. In addition, we show that our proposed mechanism is strategy-proof; that is, our proposed mechanism drives the system into an equilibrium where no users have incentives to maximize their own profit by untruthfully reporting their requests. Furthermore, we analyze the approximation ratio of our proposed approximation algorithm. We also perform experiments to investigate the performance of our proposed approximation mechanism compared to the optimal mechanism.

The traditional integer-order differential transformation methods at first order and second order tend to reduce the accuracy of the total potassium content quantitative inversion model, and there are few reports on the use of the fractional differential algorithm for the prediction of soil total potassium content. In this paper, the use of the fractional differential algorithm to predict total potassium content is introduced. Field soils collected in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from May 9 to 23, 2017, were used as the data sources. Firstly, we calculated the correlation between spectral reflectance and total potassium content for the original spectrum (R) and the root mean square spectrum ( R) under different fractional differential orders. Secondly, bands whose maximum absolute correlation coefficient was greater than 0.5 were selected as sensitive bands. R had seven bands: 562, 596, 1177, 2155, 2156, 2364, and 239 nm. R had six bands: 596, 1177, 2155, 2156, 2364, and 2398 nm. Finally, a multiple regression analysis method was employed to quantitatively estimate the optimal model. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) evaluation index of a good model should be greater than or equal to 1.4. The simulation results showed that the optimal models for R and R were the 0.8-order differential and the 0.6-order differential, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate abundance and distribution of plastic particles among soil aggregate fractions in four cropped areas and an established riparian forest buffer zone at Dian Lake, southwestern China. Plastic particles (10–0.05 mm) from fifty soil samples were extracted and then sorted by size, counted, and categorized. Plastic particles were found in all soil samples. The concentration of plastic particles ranges from 7100 to 42,960 particles kg−1(mean 18,760 particles kg−1). 95% of the sampled plastic particles are in the microplastic size (1–0.05 mm) range. The predominant form is plastic fibers, making up on average 92% of each sample followed by fragments and films that contributed with to 8%. Results of this study also show that 72% of plastic particles are associated with soil aggregates, and 28% of plastic particles are dispersed. The abundance of aggregate-associated plastic fibers is significantly greater in the micro-aggregate than that in the macro-aggregate, whereas the less concentrations of plastic films and fragments are found in the micro-aggregate. Compared to the adjacent vegetable soil, the less concentration of plastic particles in the buffer soil implicates that application of soil amendments and irrigation with wastewater must be controlled to reduce accumulation of microplastics in agricultural soils. While the implications of microplastic on ecological and human health are poorly understood, the staggering number of microplastic in agricultural soils should be continually concerned in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","53","Soil pollution","Aggregates - Forestry - Soil surveys - Soils - Vegetables","Agricultural soils - Less concentrations - Microplastic - Plastic greenhouse - Plastic particle - Soil aggregate fraction - Soil productivity - Vegetable soil","406 Highway Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: 2012ZX07102-003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Funding for this study was provided by the National Key Sciences and Technology Program for Water Solutions of China ( 2012ZX07102-003 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Later, their methane combustion performances under an oxygen-rich atmosphere were evaluated and compared. Meanwhile, their physical and chemical properties were characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, the BET method, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, H2-TPR and O2-TPD. H2-TPR and O2-TPD results illustrated that the Co/SMO-50% catalyst showed the highest reducibility and it enhanced the mobility of oxygen species.

Compacts with high strength but a relatively lower bulk density were produced. Amorphous C-S-H plays a key role in the bonding formation during powder compaction. According to the Heckel plots, particle rearrangement and plastic deformation were involved in the compaction of C-S-H powders. Point contact between C-S-H particles due to particle rearrangement dominates at a low compression pressure (i.e., 60MPa), which results in surface contact. Consequently, a solid bridge forms, and the strength of compacts increases rapidly.

These Bi-sulfosalts and tellurides have direct contact with gold, indicating that the Yaoan gold metallogenesis was likely linked to the syenite porphyry magmatism that was originally sourced from a regional lithospheric mantle probably metasomatized by subduction of Te-rich sediments. The telluride assemblage also reveals that the gold was precipitated under oxidizing conditions that has a high tellurium fugacity at the beginning (fTe2= ∼10−7.9and fS2= ∼10−8.5at ∼300 °C). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","76","Gold deposits","Bismuth compounds - Copper compounds - Deposits - Hematite - Metals - Pyrites - Tellurium compounds","Alkaline porphyry - Fluid composition - Lithospheric mantle - Metallogenic belt - Oxidizing conditions - Red River - Sulfosalts - Tellurides",,"Number: 2009CB421006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB452604, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 200805580031, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: SYSU, Sponsor: Sun Yat-sen University; Number: U1302233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40830425, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41672071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40673045, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1302233 , 41672071 , 40830425 , 40673045 ), the National Key Basic Research Program (No. 2015CB452604 , 2009CB421006 ), the Higher School Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program Funding Issue (No. 200805580031), and the Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2011).

To solve these problems, we present a real-time Bayesian non-parametric model that is able to discover activities and interactions of videos in real-time. In this model, there are two layers modeled in each scene, which are activities and interactions. An activity is represented as the distribution over visual words, and an interaction is represented as the distribution over activities. Then, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) model connects these two layers of video and automatically decides the number of clusters. Moreover, we developed a hybrid stochastic variational Gibbs sampling algorithm for inferring the parameters of the HDP mixture model. This online inference algorithm has the capacity to process the massive video stream dataset. Finally, the detailed experimental results in a crowded traffic scene and a simulated dataset are described and reveal that our online HDP mixture model achieves superior performance in real-time anomaly activity detection. © 2018 Totem Publisher, Inc.

At the same time, due to the saturation of the internal transistors, the carriers in the three conductive regions accumulate, which results in a long carrier recombination time during turn-off, so the thyristor turn-off time is also very long. In order to solve the problem of slow speed of common thyristor switch, this paper designs an analog ultra-high-speed thyristor with thyristor characteristics. The analog ultra-high-speed thyristor is composed of fully discrete devices, using symmetric Baker anti-saturation clamp. The circuit clamps the tube voltage drop of both transistors to about 1.4V, and the transistor does not enter saturation, which greatly increases the switching time. The measured results show that the analog ultra-high-speed thyristor has an on-time of less than 30 ns and a turn-off time of less than 50 ns. The switching speed is about two orders of magnitude higher than that of the high-frequency thyristor, and provides an idea for the design of high speed power devices and the tube drop clamp of transistors. © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","5","Thyristors","Feedback - Insulating materials - Speed - Timing circuits - Transistors","Anti saturations - Carrier recombination time - Distribution parameters - High frequency HF - Measured results - Orders of magnitude - Thyristor switch - Ultra high speed","413 Insulating Materials - 713.4 Pulse Circuits - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 731.1 Control Systems","Number: 61463013, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Fund Project: Uncertain Dynamic Optimization Algorithm for Nonferrous Metallurgical Process Systems (National Natural Science Foundation of China 61463013); Microgrid Operation and Energy Optimization Research with Multi-energy Complementary Wind and Light Storage (Yunnan Science and Technology Department Youth Project 2015FD049).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, it is almost impossible to calibrate a camera on-orbit in real time, for the feature points in space are irregular. To self-calibrate camera parameters in orbit, we propose a method to calibrate the camera using the orthogonal vanishing points obtained from a solar panel, which is a common component of most man-made space satellites. Using two sets of images of orthogonal parallel ribs of a solar panel under any two positions, four vanishing points are achieved. Based on the geometrical property of the orthogonal vanishing point and the infinite homography relationship between the corresponding vanishing points under different camera positions, a camera self-calibration method is proposed, and constraint equations are established to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of the camera linearly. Aiming at restraining the influence of the noise on the calibration result, an objective function based on the inverse point characteristics of rectangular imaging is proposed, and the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm is used to nonlinearly optimize the intrinsic parameters. Simulated and experimental results show that the 2D reprojection error is 0.86 pixels. This method, therefore, has better applicability in some significant space and national defense missions, such as space rendezvous and docking, attack-defense, and on-orbit servicing. The optimization algorithm shows good anti-noise interference performance, therefore the robustness of the calibration algorithm is improved. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","24","Cameras","Calibration - Computer vision - Image retrieval - Inverse problems - Manned space flight - Network security - Optimization - Orbits - Solar cell arrays - Solar concentrators - Space rendezvous","Anti-noise interference - Camera self calibration - Levenberg Marquardt optimizations - On orbit - Optimization algorithms - Orthogonal vanishing points - Self calibration - Vanishing point","656.1 Space Flight - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.5 Computer Applications - 742.2 Photographic Equipment - 921.5 Optimization Techniques","Number: 61575157, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61575157).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

One consequence has involved the degradation of lake water environments. Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) significantly shape water ecological environments and are highly correlated with the watershed ecosystem features and biodiversity levels. Analysing and predicting spatiotemporal changes in LSWT and exploring the corresponding impacts on water quality is essential for controlling and improving the ecological water environment of watersheds. In this study, Dianchi Lake was examined through an analysis of 54 water quality indicators from 10 water quality monitoring sites from 2005 to 2016. Support vector regression (SVR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN) methods were applied to form a hybrid forecasting model. A geospatial analysis was conducted to observe historical LSWTs and water quality changes for Dianchi Lake from 2005 to 2016. Based on the constructed model, LSWTs and changes in water quality were simulated for 2017 to 2020. The relationship between LSWTs and water quality thresholds was studied. The results show limited errors and highly generalized levels of predictive performance. In addition, a spatial visualization analysis shows that from 2005 to 2020, the chlorophyll-a (Chla), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) diffused from north to south and that ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) levels are increases in the northern part of Dianchi Lake, where the LSWT levels exceed 17 °C. The LSWT threshold is 17.6–18.53 °C, which falls within the threshold for nutritional water quality, but COD and TN levels fall below V class water quality standards. Transparency (Trans), COD, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and Chla levels present a close relationship with LSWT, and LSWTs are found to fundamentally affect lake cyanobacterial blooms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","28","Quality control","Backpropagation - Biochemical oxygen demand - Biodiversity - C (programming language) - Ecosystems - Global warming - Lakes - Neural networks - Nitrogen - Oxygen - Principal component analysis - Temperature - Water quality","Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) - Biochemical oxygen demands (BOD) - Cyanobacteria - Spatial and temporal variation - Support vector regression (SVR) - Surface water temperature - Water quality indicators - Water quality monitoring","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 445.2 Water Analysis - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 723.1.1 Computer Programming Languages - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2012AA121402, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FD020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41761084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41761084 ), the China High Technology Research and Development Program 863 ( 2012AA121402 ), and the Yunnan Natural Science Foundation of China ( 2016FD020 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This ore cluster is characterized by skarn Fe–Pb–Zn mineralization (∼120 Ma) in the central part and Au mineralization in the distal part. The genesis of the Heiniuwa deposit and its relationship with the skarn deposits remain unclear. All orebodies in Heiniuwa are hosted in the Upper Cambrian calcareous slate and siltstone of the Hetaoping Formation, and are controlled by the NS-striking faults. Three main paragenetic stages of mineralization have been recognized based on petrographic observation including, from early to late, a pyrite – arsenopyrite – quartz stage (stage I), a pyrite – pyrrhotite – sphalerite – galena – chalcopyrite – quartz – calcite stage (stage II), and a quartz – calcite – chlorite stage (stage III). Three types of fluid inclusions were identified in the quartz and calcite from the stage I to III in Heiniuwa, including liquid-rich (L-type), vapor-rich (V-type) and solid-bearing (S-type) inclusions. The S-type inclusions only occur in stage I quartz. The fluid inclusions from stage I homogenized at 185–326 °C (concentrating at 220–250 °C), with eutectic temperatures of −48.5 °C to −36.7 °C, final ice-melting temperatures of −11.34 °C to −0.8 °C and salinities ranging from 1.4 to 17.2 wt% NaCl equiv. The inclusions from stage II homogenized at 155–281 °C (concentrating at 190–230 °C), with eutectic temperatures of −51.6 °C to −37.5 °C, final ice-melting temperatures of −10.6 °C to −0.5 °C and corresponding salinities ranging from 0.9 to 14.6 wt% NaCl equiv. The inclusions from stage III homogenized at 116–202 °C (concentrating at 150–170 °C), with eutectic temperature of −45.5 °C to −37.5 °C, final ice-melting temperatures of −4.3 °C to −0.6 °C and salinities ranging from 1.3 to 7.2 wt% NaCl equiv. The microthermometry reveals that the ore-forming fluid of Heiniuwa gold deposit is a typical H2O–NaCl–CaCl2fluid system. The carbon and oxygen isotopes of calcite show that δ13CPDBand δ18OSMOWvalues respectively range from −13.4‰ to −6.8‰ and 9.1‰ to 9.6‰ in stage II, and from −8.1‰ to −1.5‰ and 6.4‰ to 8.2‰ in stage III. The bulk marble and calcareous slate samples have δ13CPDBand δ18OSMOWvalues from −3.0‰ to −0.7‰ and 7.8‰ to 11.9‰, respectively. This suggests that the carbon in the ore-forming fluid was probably from a magmatic source. The δ18Ofluidvalues of ore-forming fluid vary from 1.6‰ to 2.5‰ in stage I, from −6.2‰ to 0.6‰ in stage II and from −10.8‰ to −2.5‰ in stage III. This indicates that the fluid in stage I is dominantly magmatic, whereas the fluid in stage III is close to meteoric water. The decrease of Na/Ca ratios of ore-forming fluid from stage I to stage III suggests that the interaction with carbonate wallrock is significant during fluid evolution. The sulfide δ34S values range from −5.7‰ to +4.6‰ (mean = +0.3‰, n = 19), agreeing with the explanation based on C–O isotopes and fluid inclusions that the ore-forming fluids are mainly magmatic in origin. In addition, LA-ICP-MS analysis of sulfides also supports this opinion. The stage I pyrite has Cu/Ni ratios greater than 1, and a high concentration of gold; in contrast, the stage II pyrrhotite samples display a very low concentration of gold. This suggests that gold mineralization mainly occurred in stage I. The mixing between magmatic hydrothermal fluid and meteoric water is considered to be a key factor controlling the gold deposition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","80","Gold deposits","Calcite - Carbon - Copper compounds - Deposits - Eutectics - Ice - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - Isotopes - Mass spectrometers - Melting point - Mineralogy - Pyrites - Quartz - Slate - Sodium chloride - Sulfur compounds - Trace elements - Zinc sulfide","Baoshan - Carbon and oxygen isotopes - Eutectic temperature - Gold mineralization - Heiniuwa - Hydrothermal fluids - La-ICP-MS - Stable isotopes","482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 531.2 Metallography - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","Number: DD20160346, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 2015CB452606, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB452602, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The research was jointly supported by the National Key Basic Research Development Program (973 Program: 2015CB452606, 2015CB452602) and the project of "Comprehensive integration and service of mineral geology and its metallogenic regularity in China" from China Geological Survey (Grant No. DD20160346).

The following results are derived from the analysis: (1) Unimodal and bimodal precipitation regimes are observed for 19 and 11 stations, respectively, of which the Type 1 and Type 2 bimodal precipitation regime is observed for three and eight stations, respectively. The primary flood season of the Type 1 bimodal precipitation regime is around July, except for Gongshan station that is relatively long flood season. The primary flood season of the Type 2 bimodal precipitation regime is around June. The precipitation peaks are negatively correlated with latitude/elevation for each bimodal precipitation regime. (2) Basically similar spatial distributions are observed for the annual and seasonal average precipitation — the southern part of the Hengduan Mountains region experiences relatively high precipitation, whereas the central and northeastern parts experience relatively low precipitation; in addition, the precipitation trends are nonsignificant for most of the stations. A decreasing trend is observed for the annual, summer and drought season precipitation for most of the stations located in the area south of 28°N, whereas an increasing trend is observed for most of the stations located in other areas.

ACFO emits intense orange-red light peaking at 600 nm in toluene solution, which is significantly red-shifted compared with its benzophenone-based counterpart. Imparted with a small singlet-triplet splitting energy of 0.13 eV, ACFO exhibits distinct TADF feature with a short delayed fluorescent lifetime of 3.8 μs and displays a moderate photoluminescence quantum yield of 31%. Consequently, employing ACFO as an emitter results in orange-red organic light-emitting diodes that exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 11%, corresponding to a nearly 100% exciton utilization efficiency in electroluminescence process.

Through adopting various modern analysis techniques (such as X-ray diffraction pattern, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), the function and mechanism of MnO2during the phase transformation process is found out. Thermodynamic mechanisms involved in the phase transformation process with or without addition of manganese dioxide investigated by exploiting the Equilib module of FactSage. What's more, XRD patterns, XPS spectra and SEM-EDAX analyses of zinc calcines verify well the calculations of FactSage. Results reveal that the addition of MnO2will produce an aggregation of ZnMn2O4, a valuable energy material, while roasting on its own, results in generating undesirable Zn2SiO4, the oxidation degree being relatively low. Moreover, XRD pattern of zinc calcine and FT-IR spectrum of yellow product collected in the calcination process prove that the sulphur-fixing value of the additive MnO2, which can promote transforming to the elemental sulphur.

As an important ecological corridor connecting China's southwest and Southeast Asia, the Red River Basin is characterized by vulnerable ecosystems and serious soil erosion. Identifying the heterogeneity in vegetation coverage and its response to climatic factors are critical for ecological protection and soil and water conservation. MOD13Q1 NDVI data with a spatial resolution of 250 m and 16 d temporal resolution were collected from 2000 to 2014. The maximum synthesis method, univariate linear regression, Hurst exponent, and partial correlation analysis were used to detect the spatiotemporal variation and sustainability of vegetation coverage and characterize the relationship between vegetation NDVI and climatic factors in the wet season in the Red River Basin. NDVI showed a rather significant increasing trend in the wet season. The “corridor-barrier” function of valleys and mountains affected the spatiotemporal patterns in the Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region. Areas of improved, degraded, and stable vegetation coverage accounted for 50.1%, 27.1%, and 22.8% of the total, respectively. The role of precipitation was higher than temperature in the interaction between NDVI and climatic factors. A time lag effect was found in the NDVI response to rainfall and temperature variation. Different vegetation types showed various spatiotemporal responses to climatic factors.

However, the pressure regulation can be used as an effective compensation method for mass transfer enhancement. The expressions of desorption ratio(λ) and desorption rate are given by building a theoretical model of constant temperature desorption. The effect of mass transfer enhancement through pressure swing was calculated. The theoretical resultsrevealed the regularities thatthe desorption ratio(λ)would increase with the decrease of the system pressure at different desorption temperatures. The results showed that there were the same effects on the improvement of desorption rate through reducing the pressure of the system of 10 kPa or increasing the heat source temperature of 6-8. In addition, a solar adsorption unit tube adsorption refrigeration platform with activated carbon-methanol as working pair was constructed. Experiments were carried out under different desorption temperatures and system pressures, and the theoretical results were verified by experiments. The results showed that when the system pressure decreased by 14 kPa, at the desorption temperature of 90, 100 and 110, the desorption ratio(λ) increased by 20.5%, 15.1% and 12.1%, and the average desorption rate increased by 49.3%, 44.6% and 37.1%, respectively.

Because of its high growth rate, Eucalyptus camaldulensis has been introduced for plantation production in many tropical and subtropical areas in China. However, photosynthetic mechanisms underlying the rapid growth rate of E. camaldulensis are not well known. Furthermore, little is known about the relative photosynthetic limitations that complicate breeding strategies for this species. In the present study, we examined the photosynthetic characteristics for leaves of E. camaldulensis and observed stomata on both adaxial and abaxial surfaces, with their density being higher on the latter. Regardless of which surface was exposed to sunlight, the actual whole-leaf photosynthesis of E. camaldulensis reached 42.00 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1, which is much higher than that reported for other C3 plants. Although both surfaces showed high photosynthetic rates, photosynthesis and intrinsic water-use efficiency were always greater on the abaxial surface, mainly because of differences in mesophyll conductance (gm). Analysis of quantitative limitations revealed that gm was the most constraining factor for photosynthesis while stomatal conductance was much less important. Taken together, our results imply that gm is a potential target for simultaneous improvement of photosynthesis and photosynthetic water-use efficiency in E. camaldulensis, and we propose that increased gm is an important trait for breeding of that species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","43","Growth rate","Efficiency - Photosynthesis - Plants (botany) - Tropics","Eucalyptus camaldulensis - Intrinsic water-use efficiencies - Mesophyll conductance - Photosynthetic characteristics - Photosynthetic rate - Stomata - Stomatal conductance - Water use efficiency","443 Meteorology - 741.1 Light/Optics - 913.1 Production Engineering","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2016347, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 31670343, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number 2016347 ), and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 31670343 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In addition, substantial increases in grain-size and accumulation rate have been inferred in the upper part of the loess sequence, above palaeosol layer S2. This study investigates the sources of the long-term dust supply to the MLP and explores the mechanism behind the sudden increase in sediment delivery and coarsening of the loess deposits since S2 (∼240 ka) by using end member modelling of the loess grain-size dataset and single-grain zircon U-Pb dating. Our results indicate that the lower Yellow River floodplain, directly north of the MLP, served as a major dust supply for the plateau at least since the deposition of loess unit L9 and indirectly suggest that the integration of the Yellow River and the disappearance of the Sanmen palaeolake took place before L9 (∼900 ka). The sudden change in sedimentology of the Mangshan sequence above palaeosol unit S2 may result from an increased fluvial sediment flux being transported to the lower reaches of the Yellow River because of tectonic movements (initiated) in the Weihe Basin around 240 ka. Furthermore, sediment coarsening can be explained by the gradual southward migration of the lower Yellow River floodplain towards the MLP since the deposition of palaeosol S2. The migration is evidenced by the formation of an impressive scarp, and is likely caused by tectonic tilting of the floodplain area. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","73","Sediments","Banks (bodies of water) - Binary alloys - Climate change - Deposits - Dust - Floods - Geochronology - Grain size and shape - Lead alloys - Rivers - Silicate minerals - Tectonics - Uranium alloys - Zircon - Zircon deposits","End-member modelling - Grain size - Mangshan Plateau - Provenance analysis - Sanmen Gorge","407.2 Waterways - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 505.1 Nonmetallic Mines - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys","Number: 257850, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 292827, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 264935, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Academy of Finland; Number: -, Acronym: MAP, Sponsor: Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics; Number: -, Acronym: KNAW, Sponsor: Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen; Number: 41602182, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Patrick Bacon, Xiangtong Huang, Ilse Kamerling, Simon Troelstra, Noortje Vromans, Ke Wang, Wieske Wentink, Hugo Wester, Wouter Wester, Bin Zhou and local farmers from the Liugou Village for their help with sampling the Mangshan loess-palaeosol sequences in 2006 and 2008.

It was found that at a pH of 6.5, the addition of Pb(NO3)2notably improved the flotation efficiency of stibnite with butyl xanthate (BX). At a pH of 6.5, Pb2+was the dominant species adsorbing at the stibnite surface. DFT calculations implied that Pb2+could adsorb at five different sites on the stibnite surface. Furthermore, BX could adsorb onto the Pb sites at the Pb-activated surface and the Sb sites of the un-activated surface, while the adsorption of BX on the Pb-activated surface is more stable. Partial density of states (PDOS) analysis revealed that the poor overlapping between the S 3p orbital of BX and the Sb 5s orbital accounts for the weak interaction between BX and the un-activated surface. For the Pb-activated surface, the Pb 6p orbital and the S 3p orbital of BX were efficiently overlapped with each other, resulting in a relatively stronger interaction between BX and the activated surface.

The formation of an interconnected pore hybrid system is quite beneficial for the facile electrolyte penetration and fast electron transport.

In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled by using the CoMn2O4@Co3O4 core/shell hybrid nanostructure arrays on Ni foam as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode in an aqueous 3 M KOH electrolyte. A specific capacitance of 125.8 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 (89.2% retention after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 2 A g-1) and a high energy density of 44.8 W h kg-1 was obtained.

Here, we used liquid metal (LM, Galinstan) as an interface modifier material in combination with a carbon electrode. Considering the high conductivity and room-temperature fluidity, it is found that LMs are superior in improving hole extraction and, more importantly, LMs tend to be reserved at the interface between ZrO2and carbon for enhancing the contact property. Correspondingly, the carrier transfer resistance was decreased at the carbon/perovskite interface. As optimized content, the triple mesoscopic PSCs based on mixed-cation perovskite with a power conversion efficiency of 13.51% was achieved, involving a 26% increase compared to those without LMs. This work opens new techniques for LMs in optoelectronics and printing. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","38","Perovskite solar cells","Carbon - Cell engineering - Electrodes - Extraction - Interfaces (materials) - Liquid metals - Perovskite - Photovoltaic cells - Solar cells - Solar power generation - Superconducting materials - Zirconia","Future applications - Hole extractions - Hole transport layers - Interface engineering - Interface modifiers - Mesoscopics - Photovoltaic industry - Power conversion efficiencies","461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 482.2 Minerals - 531.1 Metallurgy - 615.2 Solar Power - 702.3 Solar Cells - 708.3 Superconducting Materials - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 951 Materials Science","Number: 2015AA034601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was financially supported by the China National High-tech R&D Program (863 Program, 2015AA034601).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Conventional batch extractions were carried out in parallel for comparison. Effects of the initial pH value of the aqueous phase, concentration of the extractant, and flow rate on the extraction efficiency of Cu2+have been studied including determination of separation factors (βCu/Feand βCu/Zn). According to single factor experiments, the optimal extraction parameters were an initial pH value of 1.96, extractant concentration of 15% and an aqueous or organic phase flow rate of 15 mL/min. Under these preferred conditions, copper extraction of 84.05% was achieved with βCu/Feand βCu/Znvalues of 644 and 7417, respectively. Compared with batch extraction, micromixer extraction exhibits faster extraction times, higher extraction efficiency of copper and an improved separation factor between copper and the impurity elements of iron and zinc. In addition, copper extraction isotherms (McCabe Thiele) from copper-only solutions for microfluidic extraction and batch extraction were constructed to determine the number of stages. The results show that the extraction efficiency with microfluidic extraction was better than that of traditional batch extraction. In the microfluidic extraction process, as much as 99% extraction efficiency was achieved in a single stage for the copper-only solution.

The results indicate that: (i) the negative differential thermal resistance (NDTR) effect completely depends on the period of the FK lattice in the case of fixed amplitude of on-site potential. With the increment of the lattice period, the NDTR effect is gradually disappearing. (ii) For the specific lattice period (a = 0.15), the system’s symmetry greatly affects the NDTR phenomenon. The NDTR effect becomes more and more obvious with the increment of VR. (iii) If the lattice periods of the two segments of coupled FK nonlinear lattices are not equal, the NDTR phenomenon can also occur even though the on-site potential is in symmetry (VL = VR = 1). Meanwhile, with the increment of the average environmental reference temperature, the NDTR gradually disappears. Our results indicate that the lattice period of nonlinear lattices plays a crucial role in the design of thermal devices.

This paper focuses on the core issues of heterogeneous data switching, sharing and updating in the construction of smart city. We first review the current research status of data sharing from three aspects which including big data characteristics, technology system and big data sharing platform in smart city. The analysis shows that the current data sharing research in smart city has been only used one or two types of data, and the data utilization mode is relatively simple. The research on the data sharing technology system of heterogeneous data needs to be further development. The research of data sharing is limited to a certain field, few platforms have studied data sharing in more than two fields, and horizontal data sharing methods need some breakthrough. Our work analyzes the data requirement and data source characteristics on the smart city construction platform, analyzes the hierarchical relationship and sharing relationship of various data from different platform, and clarifies the hierarchical relationship, sequence and sharing process of data sharing among different platforms. Then the platform architecture of data sharing, switching, updating and guarantee mechanism between heterogeneous systems based on cloud computing is proposed, and the data sharing and switching technology based on cloud and big data is proposed, which provide the top-level framework reference and technical support for the realization of cross platform data sharing in smart city. Finally, the paper concludes and analyzes the key implementation technology of data sharing in depth. © 2018 IEEE.","33","Smart city","Big data - Distributed computer systems","Cross-platform - Current research status - Data Sharing - Heterogeneous data - Heterogeneous systems - Platform architecture - Smart kunming - Switching technology","722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing","","Science Foundation",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, there are few studies on nocturnal transpiration of plantations in the tropics. Here, we investigated the ratio of nocturnal to daily transpiration and its seasonal differences in timber plantations of tropical angiosperm tree species in low land seasonal tropical botanical garden in southwest China. We measured sap flow in 18 tree, comprising of nine evergreen and nine deciduous species, during three months in the wet season and three months in the dry season between 2012 and 2013. We partitioned the nocturnal sap flux density (SFD) into nocturnal transpiration and trunk water recharge. We also measured wood density to investigate its relationship with nocturnal sap flux density. Our results showed that the mean nocturnal (whole night-time) VPD was linearly correlated with mean nocturnal SFD (R2> 0.41–0.73 across species) in both the wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, the ratio of nocturnal SFD to daily SFD was 0.12–0.19 and 0.15–0.2 among evergreen and deciduous species, respectively. During the dry season, this ratio increased to 0.18–0.28 for evergreen species. For evergreen species, the nocturnal trunk water recharge and nocturnal transpiration in the wet season were between 11.37–59.80% and 40.20–88.62% of nocturnal SFD, respectively. For deciduous species, these values were 18.10–66.26% and 81.90–33.73%, respectively. We found an inverse relationship between nocturnal SFD and wood density (R2= 0.24, P = ≤0.05) across the 18 studied species. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a substantia amount of nocturnal transpiration in a number of tropical tree species, even in the wet season and increased nocturnal transpiration in evergreen species in dry season. However, there was not any significant difference of the nocturnal SFD between evergreen and deciduous species during the wet season. Nocturnal transpiration is constrained by wood density across species. High nocturnal air temperature will result in increased transpirational demand and hence water loss at night. Our findings revealed important implications for nocturnal transpiration on soil-plant equilibrium and hydrology of forest ecosystems in the seasonal tropics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","58","Transpiration","Drought - Ecosystems - Forestry - Hardwoods - Plants (botany) - Timber - Tropics","Sap flux density - Seasonal variation - Vapor pressure deficit - Water recharges - Wood density","443 Meteorology - 444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.9 Biology","Number: XTBG-T01, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 31170399, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31470469, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful to the horticulture department of XTBG for permitting the experiment and the Tropical Rain Forest Ecosystem Station of XTBG for providing the climatic data.

Here we report that the luminescent properties of naphthalene diimides can be finely modulated by supramolecular cocrystal formation. Through the donor-acceptor interactions between the electron-deficient N,N′-di-(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide (DPNDI) molecules and electron-rich naphthalene derivatives (guest), a series of cocrystal complexes are successfully fabricated. These cocrystal complexes show guest-dependent color-tunable emissions, which originate from the excited state charge transfer interactions between the DPNDI and naphthalene derivatives in the solid state.

The morphology of oligoanilines was controlled from hollow to hard microspheres, by simply changing the volumes of alkaline medium. SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR and physical adsorption of nitrogen were used to characterize the products. Hexavalent chromium ion uptake experiments were run with these aniline oligomers. RESULTS: Adsorption experiments showed that the removal of chromium ions was strongly dependent on the initial pH of the solution. The pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models were well correlated with the experimental data. The adsorption of Cr(VI) and synergistic reduction to Cr(III) were confirmed by analyzing remnant chromium in the liquid and XPS detection of the exhausted adsorbent. A redox/pseudo-protonation process was suggested as the mechanism to explain the Cr(VI) removal. The adsorbed chromium ions could be desorbed by NaOH solution. The higher desorption efficiency of 96.2% was achieved by using 1.0 mol L-1NaOH as the desorption agent. CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that the hollow microsphere were the most effective adsorbent of the three adsorbents and its removal efficiency reached 99% to remove 60 mg L-1Cr(VI).

Here, we report that In3+can be used as a dopant to substitute the partial sites of Bi3+in BiVO4for modifying the surface states and improving the water oxidation activity of a BiVO4nanoflake film. Among the In3+-doped BiVO4film photoanodes, the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4film shows optimal photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity. At 1.23 V vs. RHE, the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 1.56 mA cm-2in 0.1 M Na2SO4, which is over 200% greater than that of the undoped BiVO4photoanode. In3+-doping did not change the morphology, phase and band gap of BiVO4obviously, but resulted in a positive shift of the flat band position and higher surface charge separation efficiency for water oxidation. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the surface energy of BiVO4decreased after In3+-doping that involved more unsaturated electrons of the Bi atom in the Bi-O bonds, thus reducing the amount of exposed unsaturated Bi atoms and broken Bi-O bonds. Therefore, the enhanced water oxidation activity on the In3+-doped BiVO4photoanode can be ascribed to In3+-doping that passivated the surface states of BiVO4and thus inhibited the surface charge recombination. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.","44","Vanadium compounds","Density functional theory - Electrochemistry - Energy gap - Oxidation - Semiconductor doping - Sodium sulfate - Surface states","Charge recombinations - Charge separations - Passivated surface - Photoanode materials - Photocurrent density - Photoelectrochemical water oxidation - Photoelectrochemical water splitting - Water oxidation","712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 932 High Energy Physics; Nuclear Physics; Plasma Physics","Number: -, Acronym: DICP, Sponsor: Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics; Number: 15zx7123, Acronym: SWUST, Sponsor: Southwest University of Science and Technology; Number: 15zx7104, Acronym: SWUST, Sponsor: Southwest University of Science and Technology; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2017JY0146, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; Number: 2014CB846003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41702037, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We acknowledge the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program: 2014CB846003), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41702037), the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2017JY0146), and the Research Fund of Southwest University of Science and Technology (15zx7104 and 15zx7123) for funding and supporting this work.

Corresponding ancillary frequency control functionalities and the contribution of the WF to system frequency stability are well studied. However, the impact of WF ancillary frequency control on wind turbine generators (WTGs) is rarely considered. It is found in this paper that the ancillary frequency control deteriorates drive-train torsional oscillation of the WTG, which restricts application of the ancillary control. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive damping control scheme based on reactive power modulation of the WTG to suppress the drive-train torsional oscillation, which can assist the WF to meet the grid code requirements. Superior to the traditional active power modulation method, the proposed adaptive control scheme can achieve satisfactory damping improvement with less control effort. Furthermore, the adaptive scheme with a torsional frequency updating mechanism can effectively counteract torsional damping deterioration caused by parameter uncertainties, operating condition or control mode variations. Feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed damping control are validated by simulations and real-time experiments. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","36","Electric power system control","Adaptive control systems - Asynchronous generators - Control system stability - Damping - Electric frequency control - Electric power system interconnection - Electric power transmission networks - Electric utilities - Gas generators - Modulation - Oscillators (electronic) - Reactive power - Torque - Turbogenerators - Wind power - Wind turbines","Adaptive control schemes - Adaptive damping - Grid code requirements - Large-scale wind farms - Power system frequencies - Power system stability - Torsional oscillation - Wind farm",,"Number: e-mail:,cs_xxz@163.com, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: EPRI, Sponsor: Electric Power Research Institute; Number: 61722307, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1510208, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51711530235, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: THU, Sponsor: Tsinghua University; ","Manuscript received May 8, 2017; revised August 31, 2017, November 10, 2017, and January 30, 2018; accepted March 4, 2018.

To understand climate effects on conifer radial growth in the central HengduanMountains, and the potential impacts of future climate change on conifer forests, we studied the growth responses to climate variables in Abies georgei, the major tree species of conifer forest in the HengduanMountains. We collected tree ring samples fromfour sites near the timberlines and analyzed the relationship between principle components (PC#1) of four chronologies and climatic variables (monthly mean temperature and monthly total precipitation) by using response function analysis (RFA), redundancy analysis (RDA), and moving interval analysis (MIA). A. georgei growth was affected by both temperature (positive effects) and precipitation (negative effects). Specifically, the radial growth of A. georgei was significantly and positively correlated with current July (by 6.1%) and previous November temperature (by 17.3%) (detected by both RFA and RDA), while precipitation of current June (by 6.6%) and September (by 11.7%) inhibited tree growth (detected by RDA).More rapid warming in the most recent 20 years (1990-2010) clearly enhanced growth responses to July and November temperature, whereas the relationship was weakened for June and September precipitation, according to MIA. Under the climate trend of the study area, if the increasing temperature could offset the negative effects of excessive precipitation, A. georgei radial growth would likely benefit from warming. © 2018 by the authors.","53","Climate change","Forestry - Principal component analysis","Conifer forests - Dendrochronology - Increasing temperatures - Principle component - Redundancy analysis (RDA) - Response functions - Tibetan Plateau - Total precipitation","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2018Y118, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012HC007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Youth Science and Technology Innovation Team; Number: 31600395, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Funding: This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31600395), the Scientific Research Foundation of the Educational Department of Yunnan Province (2015Z136, 2018Y118) and the Plateau Wetlands Science Innovation Team of Yunnan Province (2012HC007).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Combining the annual runoff of 1766-1911 AD at Tangnaihai Station in riverhead reach, the study builds the runoff series of four stations at the riverhead and UMYR, which is presently the clearest runoff curve of the Yellow River by historical records. According to the research, the heavy 'river disaster' that appeared in the lower Yellow River in the mid-19th century was caused by sudden changes of the runoff at the Qingtongxia-Sanmenxia section. Drought period of the river in the 1920s existed from the riverhead to the middle reach, but it was not caused by sudden changes. Meanwhile, the study also reveals that PDO and the runoff of the UMYR had a periodic inverse phase relationship on the interdecadal scale. In the early and mid-20th century, the runoff of the four stations had an inverse phase relationship on the scale of 8-16 years. In the 1830-1850s, the inverse phase relationship between PDO and flow on the scale of 4-6 years was more obvious at Lanzhou-Sanmenxia section. According to the interactive wavelet analysis, there is a significant inverse correlation between PDO and the amount of water in the UMYR on a scale of 8-16 years, but only at the Sanmenxia-Lanzhou section, suggesting that the relationship between summer rainfall in the UMYR and PDO had obvious temporal and spatial differences. (1) During the study period, the change of runoff flow in the UMYR had obvious differences; On the natural state, there was no obvious consistency in the flow change of the UMYR. The occurrence of sudden change time point was not synchronous in history. In the long term, the runoff change of the UMYR had a unique phenomenon. The simultaneous reduction of flows of each reach since the 1970s is a special phenomenon, at least it is the only phenomenon discussed in this study within this time range. (2) It is concluded that the correlation between the PDO and runoff in the UMYR is periodic and there is no special obvious linear relationship, but regional differences are more obvious. The inverse correlation between PDO and runoff in the study reaches is mainly on a decadal scale. The Lanzhou-Sanmenxia section is relatively sensitive in the face of the change of the PDO on the decadal scale. When formulating the water resources strategy of the Yellow River, we should notice the differences in the response of different sections to the same environmental background. (3) In the mid-19th century, many large-scale floods in the lower reach resulted from the sudden increase of runoff in the middle reach. In the reign of Emperor Daoguang of the mid-19th century, the Qing Dynasty declined rapidly. During this period, large-scale flood disasters occurred in many parts of eastern China, especially in the populous North China Plain and Taihu Basin. The flood brought huge financial and social losses. Among them, eastern Henan of North China Plain suffered from the flood disaster in successive years by burst of the Yellow River in the 1840s, and the central government spent a huge amount of money to solve the problem of the river, which greatly aggravated the financial difficulties in that period. The large-scale flood in the lower Yellow River corresponds to the period of sudden change of runoff flow in Sanmenxia section revealed by this research, which indicates the sudden increase of rainfall in the Loess Plateau. Climate change was deeply involved in China's decline and depression during the reign of Daoguang.

Stable NSNM predictors that could be rapidly measured to compare systems would be extremely useful. We compared the effects of crop and soil management on NSNM from 2011 to 2013 and evaluated several carbon (C) and N indices including particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil total nitrogen (STN) as NSNM indicators. Soil (0 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm depths) was collected from six long-term burley tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum L.) tillage and rotation systems. Net soil nitrogen mineralization was estimated by a 120-d laboratory incubation. The relative effects of management on NSNM among these systems were stable across 3 yr, which suggested NSNM measurement can be reduced to that frequency when NSNM is used to compare different crop and soil management. The soil C and N fractions contributed variably to predicting soil N mineralization in the different rotation systems, but SOC (which can be calculated from soil organic matter, a common index in the routine test package of many soil testing laboratories) was the best overall NSNM predictor in this study. © Soil Science Society of America, 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison WI 53711 USA.

Development of heat stress-tolerant varieties is one of the best strategies to maintain its productivity. However, heat stress tolerance is a multigenic trait and the candidate genes are poorly known. Therefore, we aimed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for vegetative stage tolerance to heat stress in rice and the corresponding candidate genes. We used genotyping-by-sequencing to generate single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers and genotype 150 F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) obtained by crossing heat tolerant “N22” and heat susceptible “IR64” varieties. A linkage map was constructed using 4,074 high quality SNP markers that corresponded to 1,638 recombinationally unique events in this mapping population. Six QTL for root length and two for shoot length under control conditions with 2.1–12% effect were identified. One QTL rlht5.1 was identified for “root length under heat stress,” with 20.4% effect. Four QTL were identified for “root length under heat stress as percent of control” that explained the total phenotypic variation from 5.2 to 8.6%. Three QTL with 5.3–10.2% effect were identified for “shoot length under heat stress,” and seven QTL with 6.6–19% effect were identified for “shoot length under heat stress expressed as percentage of control.” Among the QTL identified six were overlapping between those identified using shoot traits and root traits: two were overlapping between QTL identified for “shoot length under heat stress” and “root length expressed as percentage of control” and two QTL for “shoot length as percentage of control” were overlapping a QTL each for “root length as percentage of control” and “shoot length under heat stress.” Genes coding 1,037 potential transcripts were identified based on their location in 10 QTL regions for vegetative stage heat stress tolerance. Among these, 213 transcript annotations were reported to be connected to stress tolerance in previous research in the literature. These putative candidate genes included transcription factors, chaperone proteins (e.g., alpha-crystallin family heat shock protein 20 and DNAJ homolog heat shock protein), proteases, protein kinases, phospholipases, and proteins related to disease resistance and defense and several novel proteins currently annotated as expressed and hypothetical proteins. © 2018 Kilasi, Singh, Vallejos, Ye, Jagadish, Kusolwa and Rathinasabapathi.","46","Plants (botany)","Climate change - Gold - Heat resistance - Productivity - Proteins - Thermal stress - Transcription","Genotyping - Nagina 22 - Quantitative trait locus - Root growth - Shoot growth","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 461.9 Biology - 547.1 Precious Metals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids","","We thank Dr. Karen Koch and Dr. Jiangping Wang, University of Florida for valuable suggestions.

In this work, concrete specimens with different strength grades are dried in a thermostatic electric drier at constant temperatures of 60, 80, 105, 120 and 150 °C, and the changes in mass, ultrasonic data and strength of the specimens before and after drying are analysed. The test results demonstrate that the drying stages of concrete with different strength grades at different drying temperatures are generally the same even with variations in drying rate, time and the total water mass loss. Considering the drying temperature and strength grade, a model for concrete drying is obtained based on the modified Page model II. After drying, changes in the concrete compressive and splitting tensile strengths of different strength grade materials are highly similar and are slightly higher than those before drying. The relative strength initially decreases and subsequently increases with increasing drying temperature. The drying temperature 100–125 °C is recommended as the optimal drying temperature for different strength grades of concrete according to the minimal strength change. Further analysis shows that the change in concrete strength is the result of mutual competition between the damage caused by water evaporation and the density increase caused by drying. © 2018","23","Drying","Concretes - Isotherms - Tensile strength","Compressive and splitting tensile strengths - Concrete specimens - Constant temperature - Drying model - Drying temperature - Isothermal drying - Relative strength - Strength of concrete","412 Concrete","Number: 2017-YFC-405101-2, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51379178, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51379178 ) and the National Key R&D Plan of China ( 2017-YFC-405101-2 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A computational fluid dynamics simulation model was established by the approach. The processes of the oil flow and heat transfer inside piston cooling gallery was calculated with the model under different engine speeds. The numerical result was compared with other simulation methods and a set of test data. It was found that, the averaged heat transfer coefficient of each wall regions of the cooling gallery have great differences for a giving engine speed. The values and the moment of peaks and valleys of the heat transfer coefficient curves are different. For different engine speed, instantaneous heat transfer coefficient of all regions shows a similar rule, and it will increase with an increasing engine speed.

In this study, a spatial survey of ten lakes with different nutrient levels in Eastern Yunnan was conducted through analyzing the carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and elemental composition for aquatic plants (submerged macrophyte, floating plant), phytoplankton and zooplankton, respectively. The result shows that, among the four groups of lake organisms, floating plant has the most negative signal of stable carbon isotope, with a mean value (±SD) of -28.99‰±0.86‰. While phytoplankton (-21.88‰±2.97‰) and zooplankton (-20.85‰±2.70‰) are characterized by similar carbon isotope values, the submerged macrophyte has a large variation with significantly more positive δ13C value (-12.04‰±4.57‰). This indicates that the difference in carbon sources absorbed or utilized has caused the deviation in stable carbon isotope composition among these four organisms. In terms of stable nitrogen isotope, the primary producers, including submerged macrophyte (5.43‰±5.84‰), floating plant (5.58‰±7.38‰) and phytoplankton (7.26‰±3.83‰), show significantly similar δ15N values. While the δ15N value of primary consumer, zooplankton (11.02‰±3.18‰), is significantly higher with a averaged enrichment factor by 3.46‰, indicating the effect of nitrogen isotope fractionation across trophic levels in our lakes. Furthermore, the carbon isotope signal of lake organisms are also affected by factors such as water temperature and water depth. The variation in the nitrogen isotope signal is dominated by lake eutrophication, which leads to a gradual enrichment in the organismal signal of δ15N. In addition, the carbon and nitrogen content of aquatic organisms from Yunnan lakes are higher than those in lakes from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. There existed a threshold C/N ratio of primary producers and primary consumers in defining the shift between autochtonous and allothonous sources of organic matter in our lakes. This spatial survey provided important data for understanding the food web composition and biochemical cycling for plateau lakes. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","61","Lakes","Aquatic organisms - Biogeochemistry - Carbon - Eutrophication - Isotopes - Nitrogen - Phytoplankton - Plankton - River pollution - Surveys","Biogeochemical cycling - Carbon and nitrogen - Elemental compositions - Middle and lower reaches of the yangtze rivers - Stable carbon isotope compositions - Stable carbon isotopes - Stable nitrogen isotope - Trophic level","453 Water Pollution - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 481.2 Geochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Here we use the Maozu (∼20 Mt of sulfide ore, grading 7.25 wt% Zn and 4.15 wt% Pb) Zn-Pb deposit in the Upper Yangtze Zn-Pb metallogenic province as a case study, utilizing NanoSIMS in situ S, femtosecond LA-MC-ICPMS in situ Pb and conventional bulk Sr isotopes, as well as field data, aimed to reveal its origin and ore formation process. NanoSIMS in situ δ34S values of sulfide minerals from the Maozu deposit have a wider range (+5.9–+20.7‰) than that of bulk δ34S values (+9.9–+19.9‰). Such S isotope signatures reflect the enrichment of heavy S isotopes in ore-forming fluids, and further indicate the source of S is multiple reservoirs (e.g. marine evaporites, coeval seawater, and metamorphic rocks/fluids). Pb isotopic ratios of galena determined by LA-MC-ICPMS in situ techniques have a narrower range (206Pb/204Pb = 18.20–18.21, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.69–15.71 and 208Pb/204Pb = 38.40–38.43) than that of bulk Pb isotopic ratios (206Pb/204Pb = 18.13–18.38, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.64–15.69 and 208Pb/204Pb = 38.22–38.58). This implies that in situ Pb isotopes can truly reflect the source of Pb, which is due to impurities enclosed by sulfide crystals and pollutants introduced by chemical analysis could significantly affect the quality of the bulk Pb isotopic data. Compared with previously reported Pb isotopic data of potential source rocks (i.e. late Permian Emeishan basalts, Paleozoic ore-bearing sedimentary rocks and Proterozoic basement metamorphic rocks), the in situ Pb isotopic data are significantly different from those of basalts, but are similar to those of both basements and sediments. This means that metal-rich fluids were mainly derived from and/or flowed through basements and sediments. Sphalerite separates have initial Sr isotopic ratios (0.711–0.719) that are distinctly different from those of ore formation age-corrected basalts (87Sr/86Sr200 Ma = 0.704–0.708) and basements (87Sr/86Sr200 Ma = 0.724–0.729), whereas partly overlap with those of age-corrected sediments (87Sr/86Sr200 Ma = 0.707–0.714). Such Sr isotope signatures suggest that hydrothermal fluids were predominantly derived from and/or flowed through basements and sediments with a certain influence from basalts. Hence, the Maozu deposit has complex source rocks that are related to the local geological setting. The mixing of metal-rich fluids (related to basements and sediments, and even basalts) and S-bearing fluids (associated with multiple S reservoirs) plays a key role in the formation of sulfide ores. Therefore, the Maozu deposit, formed during Early Mesozoic (∼196 Ma), is an epigenetic Zn-Pb deposit that hosts in carbonate rocks, occurs along fault-fold structures, and has a mixed source of mineralizing elements and associated fluids. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","112","Strontium","Basalt - Binary alloys - Buildings - Crystal impurities - Deposits - Geochronology - Grading - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - Isotopes - Lead zinc deposits - Metamorphic rocks - Ore analysis - Ores - Quality control - Sedimentary rocks - Sediments - Sulfur compounds - Zinc sulfide","MC-ICP-MS - Ore formation process - S isotopes - South China - Sr isotopes","402 Buildings and Towers - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 2017YFC0602502, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41763003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB440905, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41430315, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China ( 2017YFC0602502 ), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41430315 ), the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2014CB440905 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41763003 ).
