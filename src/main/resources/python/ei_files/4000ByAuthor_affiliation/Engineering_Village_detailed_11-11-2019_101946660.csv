The results showed that the copper slag Ni-based catalyst had a relatively low surface area. However, it showed an excellent resistance to the coke deposition and a high tar removal ability. The H2 yield, carbon conversion and carbon deposit were 26.91mmol/g, 94.86% and 0.16% respectively under the conditions of 2.0% nickel loading and 600 calcination temperature. When the catalytic temperature increased from 850 to 900, the H2 yield increased by only 0.28mmol/g.

But it can not be directly used in agriculture as a result of the contamination of heavy metals. In this paper, the origins, characteristics and hazards of heavy metals in municipal sludge are described briefly. The removal and stabilization methods of sludge including chemical, biological, physical and the combination methods, are discussed emphatically. The effects of the methods on the speciation and removal efficiency of heavy metals in sludge treatment process are analyzed. In addition, the merits and weaknesses, influence factors and application scope of these methods are compared. The results show that the speciation of heavy metals is the most critical factor that influences the removal of heavy metals from municipal sludge. There are great difference in the speciation of heavy metals to distribute in sludge and the most of heavy metals existing in stable or relatively stable state, which leads to low efficiency of physical and biological method on heavy metals removal. It is noteworthy that microbial method and lower animals treatment has a better adaptability compared with plant method owing to the limit of space and time. Although heavy metals both in oxidizable and reducible speciation could be effectively transformed and removed, the electric energy consumption is quite outstanding due to the domination of heavy metal transfer from sludge into liquid phase. At present, chemical extraction is currently the best method. It is, however, difficult to utilize treated sludge due to nutrient loss and acid ions accumulation of raw sludge. Consequently, jointly using all kinds of processing technologies in order to improve the removal efficiency of heavy metal from sludge under the premise of land use remains to be further research. © 2018, Chemical Industry Press.

PV biomass was extracted using different extractants followed by different Mg-salts to recover soluble As via precipitation. Water-soluble As in PV biomass varied from 6.8% to 61% of total As depending on extraction time, with 99% of As being arsenate (AsV). Extraction with 2.1% HCl, 2.1% H3PO4, 1 M NaOH and 50% ethanol recovered 81, 78, 47 and 14% of As from PV biomass. A follow-up extraction using HCl recovered 27–32% with ethanol recovering only 5%. Though ethanol showed the lowest extractable As, residual As in the biomass was also the lowest. Among the extractants, 35% ethanol was the best to remove As from PV biomass. Approximately 90% As was removed from PV biomass using particle size 2at As:Mg ratio of 1:400 with pH 9.5 was effective to precipitate soluble As, resulting in 98% removal.

However, this protection mechanism is also a major obstacle during disease state since it dramatically hinders the drug delivery. In recent years, various tactics have been applied to assist drugs to cross the BBB including osmotic disruption of the BBB and chemical modification of prodrugs. Additionally, nanoparticles (NPs)-mediated drug delivery is emerging as an effective and non-invasive system to treat cerebral diseases. In this review, we will summarize and analyze the advances in the drug delivery across the BBB using various NPs in the last decade. The NPs will cover both traditional and novel nanocarriers. The traditional nanocarriers consist of poly(butylcyanoacrylate), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), poly(lactic acid) NPs, liposomes and inorganic systems. In the meanwhile, novel nanocarriers such as carbon quantum dots with their recent applications in drug delivery will also be introduced. In terms of significance, this review clearly depicts the BBB structure and comprehensively describes various NPs-mediated drug delivery systems according to different NPs species.

In order to treat the huge volume of quasi real-time solar observation data and cope with the computing burden of the same magnitude for high resolution reconstruction of solar image, a number of advanced ground-based solar telescopes at home and abroad have adopted the speckle masking, a method of reconstruction algorithm that can be parallely realized, to reconstruct the high resolution image. Good treatment results are obtained from this method. However, it is still hard to meet the demand for solar observation data treatment at the current efficiency, since the volume of solar telescope observation data is increasing. This paper is directed at the demands of China's new solar telescopes such as the NVST (The 1 m New Vacuum Solar Telescope) and ONSET (Optical and Near-Infrared Solar Eruption Tracer). By analyzing the computing time of each module with the Triple-Spectral method through actual measurement, the paper reaches a conclusion that the data exchange performance is a key bottleneck affecting the reconstruction effect. On this basis, the paper puts forward a universal method of global-shared low-exchange parallel high resolution image reconstruction. This method takes the Triple-Spectral as the core algorithm for image reconstruction and uses the message passing interface (MPI) and shared memory mechanism, allowing the reconstruction computing process to read and write the data in the shared memory at high speed after algorithm optimization. The shared memory, which is created for storage of image data and image reconstruction results respectively according to the size of the image, will be subsequently mapped into each process, giving access to read the processing data and store the reconstruction results independently. While computing the image reconstruction, each child process will not apply the MPI communication to obtain the sub-block image data. Instead, it will read the associated data from the shared memory according to the sub-block image numbering. After the sub-block image reconstruction is done, each child process will store the reconstruction results directly into the shared memory according to the sub-block image numbering, instead of sending the results to the host process via MPI communication. In this way the communication between processes is reduced, the comunication time saved and the data exchange efficiency improved. The experiment results show that on one 16-core PC server, it takes only about 12.4 s for reconstructing the 100-frame ONSET 1660×1660 pixel image and 5.6 s for the 100-frame NVST 1024×1024 pixel image under this method. Good efficiency is achieved in the reconstruction of solar telescope data for ONSET and NVST with different apertures, proving that this method has certain efficiency and universality. The parallel combination of the Triple-Spectral and K-T has greatly reduced the communication process and data exchange in the course of image reconstruction, saved the communication time and improved the reconstruction efficiency. To be further mentioned, the achievement of good efficiency on one server would bring the method into flexible application and save the equipment cost substantially. With the aid of the research outcome of the paper, it is expected to tackle the puzzles remained in the high resolution reconstruction of NVST and ONSET, and bring down the data storage burden. Its fulfillment of real-time high resolution reconstruction has laid a solid foundation for the follow-up researches. © 2018, Science Press.

The observation of decreased conditional binding constants with increasing DOM concentration is not well documented, which may result in significant uncertainties in heavy metal behavior modeling and risk assessment. We used eight low molecular weight organic acids (LMOC) with representative structures to simulate DOM molecules. The interactions between LMOC molecules resulted in the decreased Cu(II)-LMOC binding with increasing LMOC concentrations, but higher pH values than theoretical calculation after mixing LMOC solutions of different pHs. We thus proposed homoconjugation between LMOC molecules through negative charge-assisted H-bond ((-)CAHB). A mathematic model was developed to describe Cu(II)-LMOC complexation (KC) and LMOC homoconjugation (KLHL). The increased competition of LMOC homoconjugation over Cu(II)-LMOC complexation, as suggested by the increased ratios of KLHL/KC, resulted in the apparently decreased Cu(II)-LMOC binding with the increased LMOC concentration. Similar concentration-dependent binding was also observed for DOM. With the identified homoconjugation between DOM molecules, some of the literature data with concentration-dependent behavior may be re-evaluated. This is the first work that quantitatively identified homoconjugation among organic molecules.

Therefore, it is necessary to control and reflect the quality of TCM comprehensively in order to ensure its efficacy and safety. In Chinese Pharmacopoeia, the contents of three saponins were selected as indicators to ensure the quality of P. notoginseng. However, a single type indicator was limited to evaluate the quality of P. notoginseng comprehensively. In this study, the total polysaccharides content of P. notoginseng was determined by using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and phenol sulfuric acid reaction, and a prediction model of total polysaccharides content was established to provide some basic researches for rapid and comprehensive quality assessment of P. notoginseng based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with support vector regression (SVR). In addition, a total of 60 FTIR spectra of P. notoginseng originated from 12 regions were collected. The absorbance of UV-Vis spectra at 490 nm which was contributed by polysaccharide extraction solution was recorded, and the content of total polysaccharides was calculated based on standard linear equation of glucose. Moreover, optimization procedures of spectra data were calculated by second derivative (2D), orthogonal signal correction (OSC), wavelet transform (WT), and variable importance for the projection (VIP). 2/3 of the 60 individuals were selected to develop the calibration set by using SPXY algorithm, and the rest samples were used as validation set. Calibration set data was used to establish the SVR model and grid search, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) were used for screening optimal parameters which were utilized to verify the accuracy and reliability of the SVR model. Results showed that: (1) Maximum absorption peaks of glucose and total polysaccharides were both at 490 nm, and therefore the absorbance of UV-Vis spectra at 490 nm could be used for calculating the content of total polysaccharides. (2) The P. notoginseng from Qiubei, Shizong and Mengzi origins contained higher content of total polysaccharides (more than 25 mg•g-1) than other producing origins. (3) By analyzing the root mean square error of estimation (RMSEE) and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of optimization model, we found that the grid search model were under-fitting and the GA model were over-fitting compared with PSO model.

In this study, we integrated the molecular design tactics of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) into ESIPT molecules with the goals of improving their φPLs and increasing their fluorescence lifetimes. Two proof-of-concept molecules, PXZPDO and DMACPDO, were developed by adopting symmetric D-π-A-π-D molecular architectures (where D and A represent donors and acceptors, respectively) featuring electron-donating phenoxazine or a 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine moiety, an ESIPT core β-diketone, and phenylene π-bridges. Both molecules exhibited sole enol-type forms stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds and exhibited a unique and dynamic ESIPT character that was verified by transient absorption analyses. Endowed with distinct TADF features, PXZPDO and DMACPDO showed high φPLs of 68% and 86% in the film state, coupled with notable delayed fluorescence lifetimes of 1.33 and 1.94 μs, respectively. Employing these ESIPT emitters successfully achieved maximum external quantum efficiencies (ηexts) of 18.8% and 23.9% for yellow and green organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), respectively, which represent the state-of-the-art device performances for ESIPT emitters.

Under the same conditions, the total ash clearance rates of fresh P. notoginseng were significantly higher than those dried. Meanwhile, the saponins' loss rates were opposite. The highest daily intake of bioavailability heavy metals was rootlet. However, all of that was significantly lower than the recommended daily intake, and both the target hazard quotients and hazard index values were lower than 1. Conclusion, it is effective to decrease washing time and water temperature in order to reduce the loss of saponins of P. notoginseng on the premise that ash content of Notoginseng conforms to standard of Chinese Pharmacopeias. Safety risk assessments of heavy metals based on bioavailability can further reduce the health risk of the heavy metal exposure of Notoginseng. Practical applications: Notoginseng possesses the functions of hemostatic and promoting blood circulation. Clay on the surface of Notoginseng contains high content of heavy metal and induces the exceeding of standard. Washing is the most effective way to clean heavy metal attached on Notoginseng. However, research about the washing technology of Panax notoginseng is still blank. Heavy metals in Notoginseng that are taken orally are much higher than the amount actually absorbed by humans. In such a condition, the risk of heavy metals in Notoginseng will be overestimated, which may bring unnecessary loss to the development of Notoginseng industry. Therefore, this experiment researches the remaining of heavy metal under different washing water temperature and washing time. Also, we evaluate the bioavailability and risk of heavy metals in Notoginseng that are washed in an optimum condition. In this way, we provide technological parameters for the washing operation in processing P. notoginseng and referential data to set the quantity standard of heavy metal in Notoginseng. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","27","Risk assessment","Biochemistry - Cardiovascular system - Hazards - Health risks - Heavy metals - Metabolites - Metal cleaning - Temperature - Washing","Experiment research - Optimum conditions - Recommended daily intakes - Safety risk assessments - Target hazard quotients - Technological parameters - Washing technology - Water temperatures","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.7 Health Care - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 801.2 Biochemistry - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention","Number: 81460580, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 81460580) and by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Yunnan Province, China (grant number 2015FB138).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

But the downstream power station can utilize the limited power generating margin to formulate the self-scheduling bidding strategy to expand benefit space. In view of the problems that the accepted bidding quantity curve of downstream power station lags behind that of the upstream power station, and it is easy to miss load or price peak, the output adjusting strategy of 'pre-peak reservoir release and post-peak impound' is proposed to increase the revenue. For the problem of large-scale fluctuation in downstream power station inflow brought by weather changes, and the difficulty in consumption, the two-stage output optimization and regulation strategy of 'storage and peak shaving' is put forward to smoothly discharge water flow and alleviate water abandoning. The downstream power station will report the regulating output curve to market operator for self-scheduling bidding and achieving additional income. Finally, a system including upstream and downstream cascade hydropower stations, is taken as example for market transaction simulation. The results show that the proposed strategy can effectively improve the income of downstream power station and reduce water release. © 2018 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","20","Hydroelectric power plants","Commerce - Electric substations - Flow of water - Hydroelectric power - Ice control - Reservoirs (water) - Rivers - Scheduling - Space power generation","Cascade hydropower stations - Day ahead market - Flow delay - Self-scheduling - Weather change","441.2 Reservoirs - 443.3 Precipitation - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 615 Thermoelectric, Magnetohydrodynamic and Other Power Generators - 631.1.1 Liquid Dynamics - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 912.2 Management","Number: 51277071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51277071), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2017XS033) and Science and Technology Project of National Energy Administration.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

This kind of vibration seriously threats the safety and stability of the transmission tower-line system. The rivulet's effect on the original cross-section formation of the transmission lines and its movement are likely to be the cause of the aerodynamic instability. To analyze the mechanism of rain-wind induced vibration on transmission, the transient aerodynamic characteristics of rain-wind induced vibration on transmission line is studied based on the hybrid substructure approach in this paper. The transmission line (including the rivulet) and the flow field are considered as two substructures; the vibration response of the transmission line is measured through wind tunnel tests treated as the moving boundary condition of transmission line in the flow field. Only the flow field around the moving boundary is simulated by the computational fluid dynamics code to obtain the aerodynamic characteristics of rain-wind induced vibration on transmission line. Lastly, the transient aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients are applied to the transmission line, and the comparison is carried out between the vibration responses of the transmission line and experimental results. The research results show that the hybrid substructure approach is an effective approach to obtain the transient aerodynamic characteristics of rain-wind induced vibration on transmission line, and also provides an effective method to obtain aerodynamic characteristics which are inconvenient to be measured in the tests. © 2018, Editorial Department of JVMD.

To design a controller with appropriate performance in above synthetical cases, this paper intends to propose an adaptively receding Galerkin optimal controller design method, in which, the mathematical dynamics of unit can be directly used as a predictive model without any linearization, and the unmeasured state in the predictive model is adaptively estimated using a predesigned state observer. With the help of a mathematical predictive model, optimal control law is then obtained based on a Galerkin optimization algorithm. Due to the application of the useful information measured at every sampling time instant, the proposed method can deal with the tracking problem with constraints rather than the stabilization problem that can be only done by the traditional Galerkin optimal control. Furthermore, it can also be easily extended to estimate and thus eliminate constant disturbances in an output channel using an independent model strategy. Some simulations suggest that satisfactory tracking performance can be achieved even when the unit experiences wide-range load change. Copyright © 2018 Gang Zhao et al.

NSST and dictionary learning are two most extensively used image representation theories. Firstly, the source image is decomposed by NSST to get low frequency coefficients and the high frequency coefficients. Secondly, the high frequency coefficients are merged using the absolute-maximum rule while the low frequency coefficients are fused with a SR-based fusion approach. Finally, the fused image is obtained by inverse NSST. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in both subjective and objective evaluation. © 2018 IEEE.","16","Image fusion","Computerized tomography - Diagnosis - Inverse problems - Magnetic resonance imaging - Medical imaging","Dictionary learning - High quality images - Image fusion methods - Image representations - NSST - Shearlet transforms - Sparse representation - Subjective and objective evaluations","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 746 Imaging Techniques",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

At present, the research is more detailed on the evaluation of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas in borderland, and evaluation of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas is one of the important bases for ensuring food security, maintaining border stability, and promoting sustainable economic and social development. With Yunnan Province as an example, on the basis that the special connotations of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas are explained, in combination with the Second National Land Survey, the index system is constructed from 3 perspectives, eco-friendliness, economic feasibility, and social acceptability, and variation coefficient method and comprehensive index method are used to calculate the level of sustainable utilization of arable land and for grading. Research method: Progress in research on evaluation of sustainable utilization of arable land is learnt by literature review, and the research area is empirically analyzed by method of comparative analysis and qualitative-quantitative combined method. Conclusions: The arable land in the mountainous areas of Yunnan Province is generally in a state of sustainable utilization. Moderately sustainable and unsustainable cities and prefectures are almost equal, but there is no sustainable city or prefecture. In terms of spatial distribution, the level of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas is lower especially in mountains and highlands of the northeast Yunnan, and high mountains, highlands and canyons of the northwest Yunnan. Most of those areas are subject to a level of unsustainable utilization. The level of sustainable utilization of arable land in mountainous areas is higher in middle and eastern Yunnan. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.","23","Sustainable development","Agriculture - Economic and social effects - Food supply - Grading - Land use - Landforms - Surveys","Comparative analysis - Comprehensive index method - Economic feasibilities - Social acceptability - Sustainable cities - Sustainable economics - Sustainable utilization - Variation coefficient","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 481.1 Geology - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 822.3 Food Products - 971 Social Sciences",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Shanglongtanqing and Yilangku had reached low-rationality level with 0.642 6 and 0.605 3, respectively, Damoqing had the low-irrationality level with 0.530 9. The common factors which affected land use rationality included slope at the resettlement area (I1), reclamation rate from homestead (I6) and reforestation rate from steep slope cropland (I7) at the out-migration area. The other factors such as resettlement area dispersion (I3) and land-use type transferred into new added construction land at the resettlement area (I9) had some extent influences on land use rationality. Moreover, our results showed that the main impact factors which influenced land use rationality for the whole Xundian county included slope of resettlement area (I1), reclamation rate from homestead at out-migration area (I6), reforestation from steep slope cropland at out-migration area (I7), and land-use type transferred into new added construction land at the resettlement area(I9). It was necessary to implementing the policy strictly, taking full account of both regional land resources and environmental conditions, planning spatial layout for project land properly for the further poverty alleviation reallocation project. Measures should be implemented such as reclamation from homestead and reforestation from steep slope cropland at out-migration area without delay, and improve living environment practical at poor mountain areas. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Considerable formation of branched methylene linkages, with the highest content among all the condensed structures, was the key feature of the acidic stage. Notable changes were observed for the chemical structures and molecular masses of the resin components after the formaldehyde to urea molar ratio was lowered to 1.2 by adding post-urea at the final alkaline stage. Specifically, most of the branched hydroxymethyl groups on the polymers were cleaved, resulting in a significant decrease in the branching degree of the polymers. The performance degradation of the UF resin was attributed to this debranching effect and the production of components with low molecular masses.

Currently, most methods for ground elevation estimations that use GLAS data fail to obtain an accurate ground elevation in sloped areas. Therefore, this study aimed to propose a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based method for better estimating ground elevation from GLAS data over mountainous vegetated areas. First, the CWT was applied to each GLAS waveform for peak detection. Second, all potential ground peaks were correctly identified using GLAS waveform parameters in conjunction with auxiliary digital elevation model data. Third, the true ground peak was determined from CWT results according to several strict rules, and then the ground elevation was calculated based on the position of the true ground peak. Finally, these ground elevation estimates were validated by the digital terrain model derived from airborne discrete-return LiDAR data in Genhe in the Neimeng province of China. Additionally, the CWT-based method was also compared with previous methods, which estimate ground elevation from GLAS data over mountainous vegetated areas based on a Gaussian decomposition. It was found that our CWT-based method can reduce the root-mean-square error of ground elevation estimates by up to 0.8 m. Overall, this study can provide an available solution for estimating ground elevation from large-footprint waveform LiDAR data over mountainous vegetated areas. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","54","Aneroid altimeters","Clouds - Estimation - Geology - Ice - Laser applications - Laser beams - Mean square error - Meteorological instruments - Optical radar - Radio altimeters - Satellites - Wavelet decomposition","Continuous Wavelet Transform - Continuous wavelet transforms - Geoscience laser altimeter systems - Ground elevation - Land elevation satellites - Measurement by laser beam - Wave forms",,"Number: 2017YFA0603002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Clinical Specialty Discipline Construction Program of China; Number: XDA19030501, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","Manuscript received December 17, 2017; revised April 12, 2018; accepted May 26, 2018.

Next, the phenotypic and genomic characteristics were analysed using different biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility testing. The bacterial isolate was gram-positive. The biochemical testing results indicated that a positive reaction occurred in the tubes containing glycerol, galactose, mannitol, sucrose sorbitol and d-ribose, and a negative reaction with α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase and hydrogen sulphide. A DNA product (∼1500 base pairs) was amplified from 16S rDNA. BLAST analysis revealed that V. carniphilus from crucian carps was highly similar to V. carniphilus isolated from other sources and showed the highest similarity (95%) with reference strains.

The original Kane-Mele model is defined on a honeycomb lattice. In the work, we introduce a four-lattice-constant range hopping and the on-site Hubbard interaction into the model and keep its lattice structure unchanged. From the single-particle energy spectrum, we obtain the critical strength of the long-range hopping t L at which the topological transition occurs in the non-interacting limit of the model and our results show that it is independent of the spin-orbit coupling. After introducing the Hubbard interaction, we investigate the Mott transition and the magnetic transition of the generalized strongly correlated Kane-Mele model using the slave-rotor mean field theory and Hartree-Fock mean field theory respectively. In the small long-range hopping region, it is a correlated quantum spin Hall state below the Mott transition, while a topological Mott insulator above the Mott transition. By comparing the energy band of spin degree of freedom with the one of electrons in non-interacting limit, we find a condition for the t L-driven topological transition. Under the condition, critical values of t L at which the topological transition occurs are obtained numerically from seven self-consistency equations in both regions below and above the Mott transition. Influences of the interaction and the spin-orbit coupling on the topological transition are discussed in this work.

EML is also praised for providing great kinetics condition. The technology plays a very good role in the dephosphorization of ferrosilicon for the photovoltaic industry. In this research, the influence of the magnetic field on the temperature field under levitated conditions is studied. Building the coupling model of magnetic field and temperature field. The research uncovered that the magnetic field where the specimens are changed corresponding to the shape of specimens. The range of the temperature of the temperature field where the specimens does not vary a lot. It's due to the Joule heat generated by electromagnetic stirring inside the sample, which makes the temperature uniform. Based on this, the effect of temperature on dephosphorization is researched. The experimental researches have shown that when the levitated ferrosilicon alloy (24% Fe-76% Si) is placed in the flow of argon-hydrogen gas, the phosphorus removal increases with both time and temperature. Upon approaching the equilibrium time point, the reaction becomes mass transfer limited in the liquid phase. It's observed that an equilibrium time point exists at approximately 45 minutes, for which the concentration of phosphorus remains constant, independent of increasing refining time. Higher processing temperature results in lower final [P] content, with a 72% rate of removal achieved after 40 minutes of levitation at 1720°C. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Human disturbances and climate change in recent decades have put the ecosystem under stress, making it urgent to study biodiversity and stability of this region. Here, sediment records covering 1820s-2006 were collected from Lake Yangzong and were used to explore the patterns of diversity and stability and their relationship. Changes in lake nutrient, chironomid diversity (species richness), evenness (Invsimpson), similarity (Jaccard) and stability (ar1) were reconstructed based on nutrient indicators (total organic carbon (TOC) content, total nitrogen (TN) content and TOC/TN) and chironomid assemblages. Principal components analysis of chironomid community data was used for critical point detection. We found that TOC and TN contents increased, and abrupt changes in the chironomid community occurred since 1990. Meanwhile, community diversity, evenness and similarity all showed a rising trend. Clear increases in diversity from the 1950s, evenness from the early 1990s, and similarity and instability from 1970s indicate higher diversity and evenness of chironomid communities, corresponding well with the rising in TOC content. The increasing in TOC/TN ratio had a positive correlation with species richness, evenness and similarity, respectively, however, a negative correlation was obtained with stability. The significant negative correlation between chironomid species richness and stability in Lake Yangzong suggested that the species richness depleted its stability. © 2018 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","47","Stability","Biodiversity - Climate change - Convergence of numerical methods - Ecosystems - Lakes - Nutrients - Organic carbon - Principal component analysis","Chironomid - Community diversity - Critical point - Diversity - Negative correlation - Positive correlations - Principal components analysis - Total Organic Carbon","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In addition, combustibility index (S) of BDSS (8.67 × 10−8 min−2 K−3) was higher than TDSS. TG-MS analyses also showed that less nitrogenous gases were generated from BDSS than TDSS. It was again showed that the average CO and NO concentrations in exit gas from isothermal combustion of BDSS were lower than those from TDSS, especially at low temperatures (≤800 °C).

Meanwhile an intermolecular FF contact was also observed, which might cause rather scattered lamellar crystallinity for PTFBTV in the solid state. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.","50","Organic field effect transistors","Conjugated polymers - Fluorine containing polymers - Hole mobility - Molecular orientation - Organic solar cells - Single crystals - Solar cells","Coplanarity - Crystallinities - In-field - Non-covalent - Oligothiophenes - Polymer thin films - Structural complexity","702.3 Solar Cells - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 933.3 Electronic Structure of Solids","Number: -, Acronym: APS, Sponsor: Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: DOE, Sponsor: U.S. Department of Energy; Number: -, Acronym: SWU, Sponsor: Southwest University; Number: DE-AC02-06CH11357, Acronym: BES, Sponsor: Basic Energy Sciences; Number: 21404107, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21462052, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: SC, Sponsor: Office of Science; Number: 106112017CDJXY220006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: DMSE, Sponsor: Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering; Number: -, Acronym: ANL, Sponsor: Argonne National Laboratory; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 21404107 and 21462052) and was partially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (106112017CDJXY220006).

How to improve the image classification accuracy has become the focus of many studies. Recently, Deep learning is capable to extract discriminating high-level abstract features for image classification task, and some interesting results have been acquired in image processing. However, when deep learning is applied to the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images, the spectral-based classification method is short of spatial and scale information; the image patch-based classification method ignores the rich spectral information provided by hyperspectral images. In this study, a multi-scale feature fusion hyperspectral image classification method based on deep learning was proposed. Firstly, multiscale features were obtained by multi-scale segmentation. Then multiscale features were input into the convolution neural network to extract high-level features. Finally, the high-level features were used for classification. Experimental results show that the classification results of the fusion multi-scale features are better than the single-scale features and regional feature classification results. © 2018 IEEE.","28","Classification (of information)","Deep learning - Image classification - Image enhancement - Image fusion - Independent component analysis - Remote sensing - Spectroscopy","Classification accuracy - Classification methods - Classification results - Convolution neural network - Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image - Multi-scale features - Multiscale segmentation - Object based image analysis","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Many researchers working with vibrotactile feedback in navigation scenarios have proposed a variety of different methods of vibration. However, there is little work that has explored the relationship between navigation speed and vibration feedback both in intensity and modes. In order to find the answer, we implemented a prototype supplying with several vibration feedback modes and designed two exploratory studies to evaluate the human performance with different navigation speeds. We found using a hand-held vibration feedback device can reduce the workload of visual and auditory channels. The results also show that the speed of navigation has a significant influence on the rate of vibration mode identification.

The electrochemical performances of the products were investigated by charge/discharge testing, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that the effects of Zr doping on ordered or disordered LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4are different. Ordered LiNi0.5Mn1.49Zr0.01O4shows much better cycling stability and rate capability than that of ordered LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. In contrast, the cycling stability of disordered LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4changes little, and the rate capability decreases after Zr doping. After 200 cycles at 1 C, the capacity retentions of ordered LiNi0.5Mn1.49Zr0.01O4and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4are 95.0% and 78.0%, respectively, while the capacity retentions of disordered LiNi0.5Mn1.49Zr0.01O4and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4are 98.6% and 95.1%, respectively.

Molecular oxygen and water were used as the oxidant and solvent, respectively. Various dominant reaction parameters, including HMF/Ru molar ratio, O2pressure, reaction temperature and reaction time were systematically investigated. When HMF/Ru molar ratio was of 25, Ru/HAP catalyst exhibited the optimal catalytic performance, i.e., total conversion of HMF and 99.6% yield of FDCA were achieved at 120 °C and 1 MPa O2. Kinetic study revealed that the oxidation of HMF to FDCA followed a tandem pathway and the oxidation of carbonyl group in 5-formylfuran-2-carboxylic acid (FFCA) was found as the rate-determining step.

Abstract: Woody evergreen plants inhabiting cold desert ecosystems must retain their foliage amidst chronically dry conditions and large seasonal temperature variations. To understand the strategies enabling survival of evergreens in these environments, we monitored seasonal changes in foliar gas exchange and photosynthetic traits of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, an evergreen broadleaved shrub native to the cold desert of northwestern China. We found that photosynthesis was relatively higher in spring and summer and lower in fall and winter. Transitioning from spring to summer, A. mongolicus maintained high photosynthetic capacity (Amax). Transitioning into fall, the Amaxand maximum stomatal conductance (gsmax) decreased, while the relative stomatal limitation to photosynthesis (Ls) increased. In winter, A. mongolicus decreased Amax, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), maximum RuBisCo carboxylation rates (Vcmax), maximum RuBP regeneration rates (Jmax), and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) relative to other seasons. Collectively, these results suggest that A. mongolicus adapts physiologically to maximize carbon assimilation during spring and summer, and to maximize foliar resistance to cold stress at the expense of photosynthesis in winter. Foliage was protected against photo-oxidative damage during temperature extremes in winter by dark-sustained thermal energy dissipation. Overall, our study reveals that multiple photosynthetic adjustments, varying among the seasons, enable the survival of cold desert evergreens. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","52","Phosphorus compounds","Boron compounds - Carboxylation - Ecosystems - Energy balance - Energy dissipation - Landforms - Photosynthesis - Ruthenium compounds","Abiotic stress - Evergreen - Nitrogen-use efficiency - Photooxidative damage - Photosynthetic acclimation - Photosynthetic capacity - Photosynthetic traits - Seasonal temperature variations","454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 481.1 Geology - 525.4 Energy Losses (industrial and residential) - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity","Number: 2008-B08044, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: GZMU, Sponsor: Guizhou Minzu University; Number: 201406390041, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: ZL, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: UW, Sponsor: University of Wisconsin-Madison; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Columbia University; Number: 31570407, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements This work received financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31570407) and the 111 Project (No. 2008-B08044), as well as the Chinese Scholarship Council (File No. 201406390041 to ZL).

However, they vary the use of pitch span and pitch minimum with different lexical tones. These results thus suggest that sentence-medial prosody is different between statements and declarative questions in Bai.

Soloist gene belongs to the AP2/ERF family, and most plants own only one of it. One Jatropha curcas Soloist gene, named JcSoloist, was selected and cloned, and then the physicochemical properties, gene structure, cis-acting elements in promoter, and prokaryotic expression were systematically analyzed. This study is aimed to provide a significant foundation for further studies of the functions of Soloist gene in J. curcas and genetic improvement of the species.Method Based on the Hidden Markov Model of conserved AP2 domain and Soloist protein sequence from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, J. curcas protein database was searched by BLASTP, and then the AP2/ERF family genes were obtained through Pfam and CDD verification. Contrast analyses for JcSoloist gene were conducted by various bioinformatics tools. The expression levels of JcSoloist gene in different organs and under chilling treatment were carried out using qPCR(quantitative real-time PCR). A recombinant vector of pET-32a-JcSoloist was constructed and transferred into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). After induced expression by IPTG, samples were collected from bacterial suspension at different induction times, and then SDS-PAGE was used to analyze the protein expression level.Result The results showed that 119 AP2/ERF family genes were identified depend on J. curcas genome and protein databases. The full-length coding sequence of JcSoloist is 699 bp with 6 exons and 5 introns in gene structure. The CDS encoded 232 amino acids with the molecular weight of 26.3 kDa and the pI value of 9.65. TATA-box, CAAT-box, responsive elements of gibberellin, salicylic acid and drought were identified in the promoter. qPCR analysis revealed that JcSoloist expressed in different organs, with abundant expression in root, but scarcely present in leaves. Meanwhile, JcSoloist gene was remarkably cold-induced expression in leaves and root, which reach the highest expression levels after 3 h (34.38-fold) and 24 h (3.83-fold) chilling treatment, respectively. The prokaryotic expression vector of pET-32a-JcSoloist was constructed and a stable prokaryotic expression system was obtained, SDS-PAGE results showed that the molecular weight of fusion protein was 46.0 kDa, which is in consistence with the expected weight.Conclusion One Soloist gene was identified in J. curcas AP2/ERF gene family, and containing three anti-paralleled beta sheets and one alpha helix in the coding AP2 domain, which is in consistence with other reported species. The identification of cis-acting elements such as gibberellin and salicylic acid, suggesting that JcSoloist may play a crucial role in J. curcas hormonal signaling transduction. The expression levels of JcSoloist gene were remarkably induced by low temperature, indicating that JcSoloist possibly participates in the pathways of chilling response or chilling signaling transduction, and involved in the formation of cold resistance in J. curcas, this becomes a candidate gene for the breeding of cold-resistance varieties in J. curcas. © 2018, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

First, most of those indices can highlight one urban biophysical composition, such as impervious surfaces, vegetation, or water. Furthermore, most of those indices depend on short-and mid-wave infrared and thermal infrared bands and thus have limited availability in high-resolution imagery. Finally, the separability between impervious surfaces and bare soil still needs to improve. Therefore, this paper proposed a combinational biophysical composition index (CBCI) for effective highlighting the four-major urban biophysical compositions. Correlation analyses were performed to estimate the relationship between the CBCI values and biophysical compositions, and the spectral discrimination index (SDI) was conducted to test the separability degree between impervious surfaces and bare soil. Moreover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference building index, BCI, and the combinational build-up index were utilized to perform the comparative analyses. Moreover, this paper investigated the applicability of the CBCI in different spatial resolution remote sensing images. Our results indicated that the CBCI had a much closer relationship with impervious surface fraction than the other four indices and had a stronger correlation with vegetation abundances when compared with the NDVI. In addition, the CBCI had much higher SDI values than the other indices. This paper proved that the CBCI was an effective index for highlighting the four-major urban biophysical compositions and had good performance for separating impervious surfaces and bare soil. © 2013 IEEE.","55","Biophysics","Image resolution - Infrared radiation - Mapping - Reflection - Remote sensing - Soils - Vegetation - Water","Bare soils - Biophysical composition indices - GF-1 - Impervious surface - Indexes - Land surface - LANDSAT - MODIS - Spatial resolution - Vegetation mapping",,"Number: 20115303110002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011Y307, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2011XX2005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: yjs201680, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported in part by the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education under Grant 20115303110002, in part by the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Project under Grant 2011XX2005, in part by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education Research Fund under Grant 2011Y307, and in part by the Yunnan Normal University Postgraduate Innovation Fund under Grant yjs201680.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to quantify how agricultural distribution (i.e., the spatial distributions of agricultural land uses) and composition (i.e., the relative percentages of different types of agricultural land uses) influenced N export from a Chinese subtropical watershed, accounting for aquatic N retention by river networks. Nitrogen sources displayed high spatial variability, with 40.7% of the total N (TN) export from the watershed as a whole derived from several subwatersheds that accounted for only 18% of the watershed area. These subwatersheds were all located close to the watershed mouth. Agricultural composition strongly affected inputs to the river network. The percentages of dry agricultural land and rice paddy fields, and the number of cattle together explained 70.5% of the variability of the TN input to the river network among different subwatersheds. Total N loading to the river network was positively correlated with the percentage of dry land in total land areas and the number of cattle within subwatersheds, but negatively with the proportion of paddy fields. Distribution of agricultural land uses also affected N export at the mouth of the watershed. Moreover, N retention in the river network increased with increasing N transport distance from source subwatershed to the watershed mouth.

Nowadays, solar water heating system is not only used for the domestic water heating project, but also used in the field of high technical requirements such as heating, air conditioning, industrial water, and swimming pool heating. In this chapter, the split-type vacuum tube water heating system and split-type flat plate water heating system were structured. Afterward, an analysis regarding their performance was conducted. The research results showed that the reverse slope has great impact on the thermal performance of the split-type vacuum tube solar water heating system, such as that the stratification of the water tank decreased by 3% and the collecting thermal efficiency decreased by 15% d from 60% to 45%. Under the 90° installation angle, the average daily thermal efficiency of the horizontal vacuum tube solar collector is 25% higher than the thermal efficiency of the vertical vacuum tube solar collector. The efficiencies of the horizontal flat plate collector and vertical flat plate are 28% and 19.8%, respectively. When the flat plate solar water heating system is circled by water circulating pump, the growth rate for the system thermal efficiency was 13%. Moreover, the height of the bottom of the water tank to the top of the collector has limited impact on the system thermal efficiency. When the height between the water tank bottom and the collector top varied between 0.44 m and 1.04 m, the range of the thermal efficiency is less than 3%. Finally, the operation performance of the hot water heating system compounded by solar water heater and air source heat pump applied in cold Tibetan area of Shangri-La was tested by experiment. The result revealed that when the outdoor environment temperature is 7° C, 2 °C, and 7 °C, capering with the independent heat pump heating system, the heat production and of the hot water heating system compounded by solar water heater and air source heat pump improved 16.2%, 14.1%, and 11.5%, respectively, while the system COP increased 19.0%, 10.6%, and 5.5%, respectively. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","15","Air source heat pumps","Air conditioning - Coefficient of performance - Collector efficiency - Dust collectors - Electron tubes - Growth rate - Hot water distribution systems - Hot water heating - Plates (structural components) - Pumps - Solar energy - Solar heating - Solar water heaters - Tubes (components) - Water - Water heaters - Water tanks","Flat-plate collector - Hot-water heating systems - Outdoor environment temperature - Solar water heating systems - Thermal efficiency - Vacuum tube collectors - Water circulating pumps - Water heating systems","408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 618.2 Pumps - 619.1 Pipe, Piping and Pipelines - 619.2 Tanks - 643.1 Space Heating - 643.3 Air Conditioning - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 714.1 Electron Tubes",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The contents of citronellol, citronellyl formate, and rose oxide are significantly lower in polyploid seedlings than in cutting seedlings. ISSR and RAPD molecular markers were used to analyze P. graveolens in two different genetic populations and to compare the genetic background of differences between cutting and polyploid seedlings. The genomic DNA of 60 cutting and polyploid seedlings was extracted for PCR amplification by using 3 ISSR primers and 11 RAPD primers for random sampling from adjacent cultivated fields. Among the primers, ISSR-25 primer detected the highest diversity of the loci. Seven loci of variation were found in the two populations. The variation rates detected using 3 ISSR primers were 13.3% and 6.7% for the cutting and polyploid populations, respectively. Genetic polymorphisms in P. graveolens genome with mutation rates of 11.7% and 3.3% were respectively determined in cutting and polyploid seedlings by using 3 RAPD primers (B11, P4, and R19). Both types of molecular markers also revealed the mutation in cutting and polyploid seedlings. Results demonstrated that a genetic difference can be observed by the molecular markers, although no evident phenotypic difference exists in cutting and polyploid seedlings in fields. The trend of these molecular markers is consistent, that is, individual genetic differences in cutting seedlings are greater than those in polyploid seedlings. These results suggested that polyploid seedlings in a population are relative uniform and applicable to production.

A critical challenge remains in the exploration of clinically potential noble metal nanoparticles for highly efficient cancer theranostics. Here, we introduce albumin-coordinated assembly of clearable Pt nanodots (Pt-NDs) with monodisperse nanostructure as high-performance theranostic agents for imaging-guided photothermal tumor ablation. We precisely manipulate the reduction and growth of tetravalent Pt ions into ultrasmall nanodots through albumin-directed growth kinetics, thereby leading to the synthesis of monodisperse 6.7 nm Pt-NDs with albumin molecules as the corona. Pt-NDs exhibit the surface plasmon resonance at 225 nm with enhanced near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, ideal resistance to photo-bleaching, distinct photoacoustic and X-ray signals, as well as remarkable photothermal effect through non-radiative relaxation under NIR light irradiation. In particular, Pt-NDs possess preferable tumor accumulation, and effective in vivo excretory capability. Thus, these nanodots promote preferable in vivo microscopic photoacoustics and spatially anatomic CT imaging with enhanced contrast, as well as potent hyperthermia-mediated tumor ablation. These findings represent a facile and general approach to fabricate high-performance noble metal nanostructures with clinical potential for cancer theranostics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","60","Nanodots","Ablation - Computerized tomography - Diseases - Growth kinetics - Image enhancement - Infrared devices - Medical nanotechnology - Metal nanoparticles - Platinum - Precious metals - Surface plasmon resonance - Synthesis (chemical) - Tumors","Albumin - Metal nanostructure - Monodisperse nanostructures - Multi-modal imaging - Non-radiative relaxation - Photothermal effects - Photothermal therapy - Theranostics","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 547.1 Precious Metals - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 723.5 Computer Applications - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions","Number: IRT13016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB931900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB931802, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31422021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81771978, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81627901, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11304238, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81473171, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31671016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31422021 , 31671016 , 11304238 , 81771978 , 81627901 and 81473171 ), National Basic Research Program ( 2014CB931900 and 2015CB931802 ), PCSIRT (No. IRT13016 ) the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-Psycho-Diseases.

A distinct feature of this model is that the degrees of freedom of different motions such as vehicle yaw motion, body lateral motion, roll motion of sprung mass, and fluid sloshing dynamics are integrated into a unified tank vehicle model. Thus, this model links fluid sloshing dynamics to vehicle lateral dynamics. The proposed model was evaluated by open-loop response subject to sine with dwell steering input. Two cases of fill level (FL=40% and 80%) and two cases of tank ellipticity (Δ =1.0 and 1.3) were evaluated in simulations. The results reveal that the proposed model can reflect the effects of fill level and tank ellipticity on vehicle roll stability, lateral dynamics stability and handling property significantly well. Thus, the proposed model is extremely suitable for the study of lateral coupling dynamics of TSTTV. In particular, the model can be used for the optimal design of TSTTV subject to the effects of certain transport conditions such as fluid type, fill level, and road features, with the aim of comprehensively improving vehicle lateral dynamics. Therefore, it is of great significance by the proposed model to enhance the design performance of tank vehicles and improve driving safety and transport efficiency. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

The key step of the method is that oil droplets were entrained into the foam phase, which was then driven to separate the phases to form porous structures through evaporation of volatile solvent at evaluated temperature. The results showed that the pore morphologies and the particle sizes were influenced by the ratio of polystyrene to porogen (R PS/HT), the PVA concentration and the agitation speed. When R PS/HT was extremely low, the internal structure of the microspheres became hollow. The particle size of the polystyrene microspheres decreased from 52μm±23μm to 23μm±20μm by increasing the PVA concentration from 1% to 3% and that decreased from 107μm±40μm to 45μm±20μm by increasing the agitation speed from 300r/min to 700r/min respectively.
