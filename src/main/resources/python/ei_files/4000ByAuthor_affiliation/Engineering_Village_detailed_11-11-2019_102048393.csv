With the development of modern electrophysiology technology, some recent multi-electrode technologies have been able to record the activity of thousands of neuronal spikes simultaneously. In this scenario, however, the recorded activity may be the overlap of multi-neuron spikes, which will degrade the sorting performance of existing cluster-based algorithms. In this paper, we introduce methods for overlapping spike sorting. The introduced methods start from a convolution model, where a sparse vector could be obtained via sparse coding or compressive sensing. Then, we use a maximum a posteriori estimate to optimize the sparse vector, which makes the overlapped spike sorting completed successfully. The advantage of the introduced method is that it performs better than traditional methods when the waveforms of the spikes are similar. In experiments, some synthetic and real spike data are used to testify the methods. The experiment results show that the introduced methods' average sorting detection, defined as the ratio of successfully sorted spikes to the total spikes is nearly 4% higher than the traditional methods, under the condition of the experimental data with similar waveforms. © 2018 IEEE.","35","Sorting","Brain - Codes (symbols) - Compressed sensing - Electrophysiology - Neural networks","Brain activity - Compressive sensing - Convolution model - Maximum a posteriori - Multi-electrode - overlapping spike - Sparse coding - Spike-sorting",,"Number: 2014HB019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018FA036, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61762093, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program; ","Manuscript received April 26, 2017; revised April 19, 2018 and June 12, 2018; accepted June 13, 2018.

The nonthermal radiative properties of 18 pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are studied in the 1D leptonic model. Methods. The dynamical and radiative evolution of a PWN in a nonradiative supernova remnant are self-consistently investigated in this model. The leptons (electrons/positrons) are injected with a broken power-law form, and nonthermal emission from a PWN is mainly produced by time-dependent relativistic leptons through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton process. Results. Observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of all 18 PWNe are reproduced well, where the indexes of low-energy electron components lie in the range of 1.0-1.8 and those of high-energy electron components in the range of 2.1-3.1. Our results show that FX=Fy> 10 for young PWNe; 1 X=Fy≤ 10 for evolved PWNe, except for G292.0+1.8; and FX=Fy≤ 1 for mature/old PWNe, except for CTA 1. Moreover, most PWNe are particle-dominated. Statistical analysis for the sample of 14 PWNe further indicate that (1) not all pulsar parameters have correlations with electron injection parameters, but electron maximum energy and PWN magnetic field correlate with the magnetic field at the light cylinder, the potential difference at the polar cap, and the spindown power; (2) the spin-down power positively correlates with radio, X-ray, bolometric, and synchrotron luminosities, but does not correlate with gamma-ray luminosity; (3) the spin-down power positively correlates with radio, X-ray, and -band surface brightness; and (4) the PWN radius and the PWN age negatively correlate with X-ray luminosity, the ratio of X-ray to gamma-ray luminosities, and the synchrotron luminosity. © ESO 2018.","173","Gamma rays","Electrons - Galaxies - Heat radiation - Luminance - Magnetic fields - Pulsars - Synchrotron radiation - Synchrotrons - X rays","Acceleration of particles - High-energy electron - Injection parameters - Low energy electrons - Pulsars: general - Radiation mechanisms: non thermal - Spectral energy distribution - Stars: winds , outflows","641.2 Heat Transfer - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 932.1.1 Particle Accelerators","Number: 11173020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11433004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11563009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: RFDP 20115301110005, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; ","Acknowledgements.

Our search reveals that there are many effective statistical methods in the literature for normal data, and that they can easily be used to test hypotheses regarding parameter values permitting asymptotically normal estimators. We find that the classical likelihood ratio test is unsatisfactory, because to control the size, it must cope with the least favorable distributions at the cost of power. In this article, we find a novel way to slightly ease the size control, obtaining a much more powerful test. Simulation confirms that the new test retains good control of the Type I error and is markedly more powerful than the likelihood ratio test as well as many competitors based on normal data.

Boletus edulis mushroom is a well-known food resource in the world. Its nutritional and medicinal properties are drastically varied depending on geographical origins. In this study, three sensor systems (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR)) were applied for the origin traceability of 192 mushroom samples (caps and stipes) in combination with chemometrics. The difference between cap and stipe was clearly illustrated based on a single sensor technique, respectively. Feature variables from three instruments were used for origin traceability. Two supervised classification methods, partial least square discriminant analysis (FLS-DA) and grid search support vector machine (GS-SVM), were applied to develop mathematical models. Two steps (internal cross-validation and external prediction for unknown samples) were used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. The result is satisfactory with high accuracies ranging from 90.625% to 100%. These models also have an excellent generalization ability with the optimal parameters.

Therefore, the desert soil in Fukang City of XingJiang, China, was chosen as the research focus. Field hyperspectral data and surface soil down to 20 cm depth were collected between May 9-23, 2017. The Grünwald-Letnikov fractional differential algorithm was introduced to explore the pretreatment effect of the correlation between total phosphorus content and five spectral transformations. Simulation results showed that this fractional differential algorithm could elaborately describe the slight differences in spectral reflectance, and the fractional differential was close to zero on the whole. Because the sensitivity of the spectrum is controlled by the weighted order, when the order gradually increased from zero order to first order, the curve of the fractional differential slowly approached the first-order differential curve, and it slowly approximated the secondorder differential curve while increasing from first order to second order. The overall trend in band number that satisfied the 0.05 significance test under five spectral transformations was an initial increase followed by decrease as the order increased. The maximum absolute values of correlation coefficients appeared at 1.2 and 1.4 order; the corresponding band was 2067 nm. This study made up for the research gap in field measurement spectra based on the fractional differential algorithm, and revealed a novel preprocessing method for field hyperspectral data. © 2018 MYU Scientific Publishing Division.

Based on the generated predictions, students identified as being at risk of academic retention or performance can be provided support in a more timely manner. This study creates different classification models for predicting student performance, using data collected from an Australian university. The data include student enrolment details as well as the activity data generated from the university learning management system (LMS). The enrolment data contain student information such as socio-demographic features, university admission basis (e.g. via entry exam or past experience) and attendance type (e.g. full-time vs. part-time). The LMS data record student engagement with their online learning activities. An important contribution of this study is the consideration of student heterogeneity in constructing the predictive models. This is based on the observation that students with different socio-demographic features or study modes may exhibit varying learning motivations. The experiments validated the hypothesis that the models trained with instances in student sub-populations outperform those constructed using all data instances. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that considering both enrolment and course activity features aids in identifying vulnerable students more precisely. The experiments determined that no individual method exhibits superior performance in all aspects. However, the rule-based and tree-based methods generate models with higher interpretability, making them more useful for designing effective student support. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","35","Students","Data mining - Forecasting - Information management - Population statistics","Educational data mining - Educational institutions - Learning management system - Online learning activities - Predicting academic performance - Student performance - University admissions - WEKA",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The calculated band structure and density of states demonstrates that the bonding of the 14-LPSO occur mainly among the valence electrons of Mg3s, Zn4s, Y5s, Y4p orbits, and the energy is in a range from -8 eV to 3 eV. Similarly, the bonding of the Mg3Y2Zn3 occur mainly among the valence electrons of Mg3s, Zn3p, Y4d orbits, and the energy is in a range from -8 eV to 0.5 eV.

This review discusses the progress of research into the chemistry and biological activity of 421 natural PPAPs in the past 11 years as well as in-depth studies of biological activities and total synthesis of some PPAPs isolated before 2006. We created an online database of all PPAPs known to date at http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/grossman/PPAPs. Two subclasses of biosynthetically related metabolites, spirocyclic PPAPs with octahydrospiro[cyclohexan-1,5′-indene]-2,4,6-trione core and complicated PPAPs produced by intramolecular [4 + 2] cycloadditions of MPAPs, are brought into the PPAP family. Some PPAPs' relative or absolute configurations are reassigned or critically discussed, and the confusing trivial names in PPAPs investigations are clarified. Pharmacologic studies have revealed a new molecular mechanism whereby hyperforin and its derivatives regulate neurotransmitter levels by activating TRPC6 as well as the antitumor mechanism of garcinol and its analogues. The antineoplastic potential of some type B PPAPs such as oblongifolin C and guttiferone K has increased significantly.

Here, we compare attribution results from two UK Met Office Hadley Centre models, HadGEM3-GA6 and weather@home (HadAM3P driving 50 km HadRM3P). Within HadGEM3-GA6 July 2017-like heatwaves were unequaled in the ensemble representing the world without human influences. Such heatwaves became approximately a 1 in 50 year event and increased by a factor of 4.8 (5%-95% range of 3.1 to 8.0) in weather@home as a result of human activity. Considering the risk ratio (RR) for the full range of return periods shows a discrepancy at all return times between the two model results. Within weather@home a range of different counterfactual sea surface temperature (SST) patterns were used, whereas HadGEM3-GA6 used a single estimate. The global mean difference in SST (between factual and counterfactual simulations) is shown to be related to the generalised extreme value (GEV) location parameter and consequently the RR, especially for return periods of less than 50 years. It is suggested that a suitable range of SST patterns are used for future attribution studies to ensure that this source of uncertainty is represented within the simulations and subsequent attribution results. It is shown that the risk change between factual and counterfactual simulations is not purely a simple shift in the distribution (i.e. change in GEV location parameter). For return periods greater than 50 years, the GEV shape parameter is found to strongly influence the RR determined with the GEV scale parameter affecting only the most severe events. © 2018 The Author(s).

Measuring the similarity between users according to check-ins is a key issue in many technologies for location-aware services such as clustering and collaborative filtering. Some works convert check-ins into vectors and compute the similarity between vectors, such as Cosine similarity and Pearson similarity, as the similarity between users. However, these similarity measurements do not exploit well the spatio-temporal gather and decay of check-ins. It can be easily observed that users tend to visit nearby places at nearby times. In this paper, we define co-occurrence patterns based on the time similarity and the location similarity. Then, we propose the spatio-temporal similarity by utilizing the most similar co-occurrence patterns. Finally, we verify the spatio-temporal similarity is effective by applying it to time-aware POI recommendation. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","13","Location based services","Big data - Collaborative filtering - Information management - Location","Co-occurrence pattern - Cosine similarity - Large volumes - Location aware services - Location-based social networks - Point of interest - Similarity measurements - Spatio temporal","716 Telecommunication; Radar, Radio and Television - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis","Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 201708535025, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: WX069051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61662086, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61762090, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements.

The unconfined compression test was used to investigate the reinforcement soil behavior of herb roots. This paper used the 3D finite element to quantify the mechanical effect of the herb root for slope’s stability in terms of the safety factor. The soil was simulated by an elastic-plastic model, and the root was simulated by a linear elastic model. Results show that using the Root Content (RC) to estimate the additional cohesion cr of Setaria sphacelata and Orchardgrass was a simple and reliable method. Lateral fine roots can play a more significant role in reinforcing soils and slopes. Compared to various slope angles, the steep slope was less stable. The slope existed a slope angle threshold αthr. When the slope angle α was smaller than αthr, the herb root system can improve the stability of slope. The α existed an optimal angle αopt for the root system. When α = αopt and α thr, the herb roots can exert its maximum stabilization capacity. Moreover, we can select herb species with lateral fine roots and more roots in deeper soil layer. Results can better estimate the cr for the herb of lateral fine roots and select the herb and the slope’s geometry in the engineering. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","45","Slope stability","Compression testing - Elastoplasticity - Reinforcement - Safety factor - Soils","3-D finite elements - 3-D numerical simulation - Elastic -plastic models - herb - Linear elastic model - Soil reinforcement - Stability of slopes - Unconfined compression tests",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this method, the input of price data is clustered by TS fuzzy model. In the identification of the TS fuzzy model, a hyperplane prototype fuzzy clustering model is proposed, which obtain the rules. Furthermore, in this model, a new stochastic search algorithm is applied to optimize the clustering objective function. To implement the proposed forecast strategy, the price data is first decomposed by Wavelet Transform (WT). Then, each produced wavelet component is filtered by two stage feature selection based on mutual information. Afterward, the hybrid fuzzy neural network-based forecast engine is used to predict the future values of each price component.

Considering the relationships between properties and labels can improve accuracy of classification methods, but the diversities of properties and labels will present the curse of dimensionality.

However, studies on the abundance and distribution of cavity trees in tropical forests are much less common than those in temperate forests. Also, how tree characteristics and topographic variables affect cavity presence is less clear in tropical forests. We surveyed 27 745 living trees from 386 species using ground-based observations in a tropical rainforest in southwestern China. The density of cavity trees was 86.3 trees·ha–1, which dramatically exceeded that in temperate forests. The number of cavity trees showed a left-skewed distribution with a peak at 10–20 cm diameter at breast height (DBH). The probability of cavity presence in a tree increased with DBH, although the patterns varied across species and crown positions. Moreover, cavity presence, which is influenced by topography in this tropical forest, decreased from valleys (concave terrain and low elevation) to ridges (convex terrain and high elevation). The results prove for the first time that topography is a good predictor of cavity presence, in addition to tree DBH.

However, the subjective evaluation fails to meet the automatic and precise requirements of tobacco production. The quality of tobacco leaves is affected by a variety of factors, such as color, oil content, maturity, and surface texture, among which color is one of the most important factors. Color evaluation is critical for quality management in the agricultural field. However, there is no specific standard color chart for flue-cured tobacco leaves, and there are few studies focusing the development of such a color chart. In this work, a framework for the development of a color chart was established by computer vision techniques and it was applied to flue-cured tobacco leaves. The color chart system (CCS) consisted of data acquisition, color representation for a single leaf, and the development of the color chart for flue-cured tobacco leaves. Firstly, an acquisition device was developed to collect digital color images of flue-cured tobacco leaves, which was equipped with CCD sensors that detect color information accurately. Secondly, a proportional threshold method was proposed to represent a feature color from the acquired images by taking into consideration the overall color information of a single leaf. Finally, color discrimination techniques were used to create digital color charts depicting synthetic, standard-color tobacco leaves at various degrees. The color charts established in this work faithfully express the flue-cured tobacco leaves color information, and the framework of CCS based on computer vision can be applied to other agricultural situations where color estimation is required. © MYU K.K.","30","Color","Color vision - Computer vision - Curing - Data acquisition - Flues - Quality control - Quality management - Tobacco","Acquisition device - Color charts - Computer vision techniques - Environmental factors - Proportional threshold - Subjective evaluations - Subjective experiences - Tobacco leaf","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.2 Vision - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 912.2 Management - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control","Number: 2016YN02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 2017YFD0400100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Research and Development; Number: 61673052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Research and Development Major Project (No. 2017YFD0400100), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61673052), and the Science and Technology Planning Project of Yunnan Province Tobacco Company (No. 2016YN02).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) occur in all tissues of the potato, and consuming potatoes with a high SGA content harms human health. Therefore, the effects of different cooking methods on the SGA content in potato foods were investigated in this study. The results indicated that adding food-grade acetic acid during the manufacturing process did not affect the SGA content in stir-fried shredded potatoes or fresh mashed potatoes. However, the SGA content in potato food after peeling was significantly lower than that in non-peeled food, and the volume ratio of potato skin to flesh decreased with the increase of the potato tuber volume. Therefore, potato breeders and farmers should make the most hard to increase the proportion of commodity potato via corresponding science and technology. In addition, frying significantly reduced the SGA content in potato chips. Further research indicated that SGAs degraded slowly at 150°C, while they degraded rapidly at 190°C within 30 min. The temperature of rapeseed oil in the frying process can be as high above 200°C. Thus, frying significantly decreased the SGA content in potato chips, which could be attributed to temperature. These results will provide a theoretical basis and practical guidance for potato breeding and cooking. © 2018 Xuheng Nie, Guanghai Zhang, Shidong Lv, Huachun Guo.","27","Oils and fats","Cooking - Peeling - Temperature","Cooking methods - Frying process - Glycoalkaloids - Manufacturing process - Potato tubers - Practical guidance - Science and Technology - Volume ratio","641.1 Thermodynamics - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 822.2 Food Processing Operations","Number: CARS-09-P15, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017FD025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017FD025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","We sincerely thank Zhiling Shao at the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Food and Oil Sciences for his guidance and National Potato Special Fund of the Modern Agricultural Industrial Technological System (CARS-09-P15) and the Youth Project Fund of the Scientific and Technological Departmentof Yunnan province (2017FD025) for their financial support in conducting the experiments.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Chiral polyaniline[(+)-PANI] was synthesized with aniline as monomer and D-camphorsulfonic acid[D-(+)-CSA] as chiral dopant. The silica dioxide was coated on the surface of (+)-PANI by sol-gel approach, thus to obtain the chiral polyaniline/silica dioxide core/shell composite[(+)-PANI@SiO2].

The UV-Vis absorption spectra, circular dichroism and specific rotation demonstrated that the (+)-PANI and(+)-PANI@SiO2 endowed with optical activity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to verify the surface groups and the scanning electron microscopy was used to verify the core/shell conformation. The (+)-PANI and (+)-PANI@SiO2 were used as chiral selectors for the enantioselective crystallization of alanine racemates, respectively. L-alanine was preferable induced from the racemic solution.

Firstly, the idea of proactive estimation is put forward and used to narrow down and restrict the feasible solution space, which helps to speed up the global search. Then, an adaptive standard deviation (SD) is presented to replace the constant SD in the original IWO, which helps the algorithm to improve the convergence speed, and make it more exploitive.

Laparoscopic surgery usually needs at least two doctors, a surgeon and a laparoscope assistant. The view of the operating surgeon is provided by the laparoscope assistant. As misunderstandings or conflicts of cooperation may happen, an ideal way is that the surgeon has a full control of all the instruments including the surgical tools and laparoscope. To achieve it, an eye based interaction method is introduced in this paper that allows surgeons to control the view by themselves. With recent developments in the eye tracker platforms and associated eye tracking technologies, many non-contact eye tracking systems are available. It can record where a person is looking at any time and a sequence of eye movements. This information can be used to know where is the attention and interest of the person on a display. As such, surgeon's attention can be captured and then be followed by moving the laparoscope to the region of interest. To have a safe and efficient evaluation on the usability, a virtual reality based laparoscopic surgery simulation is built. It is based on Unity with two haptic devices simulating the surgical tools, a 3D mouse providing 6 degrees-of-freedom control of the camera and an eye tracker capturing eyes' positions on a display. Experiments on moving a camera left, right, up, down, in, out and to specified locations using eyes are conducted, and moreover the performances of the proposed eye based self-control and the 3D mouse based other-control are compared. The results are promising where the proposed pointing method leads to 43.6% faster completion of the tasks against the traditional other-control method using the 3D mouse. © 2018 IEEE.","23","Eye movements","Cameras - Cybernetics - Degrees of freedom (mechanics) - Display devices - Eye tracking - Image segmentation - Laparoscopy - Mammals - Surgery - Surgical equipment - Virtual reality","Eye tracking systems - Eye tracking technologies - Eye-gaze - haptic - Interaction methods - Laparoscopic surgery - Pointing methods - Region of interest","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 462.1 Biomedical Equipment, General - 722.2 Computer Peripheral Equipment - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 742.2 Photographic Equipment - 931.1 Mechanics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The occurrence of debris flow has a great impact on the land cover. At present, remote sensing monitoring has been widely used in land use surveys due to its characteristic of non-directly contacting with the measured objects. Therefore, the use of remote sensing technology is a safe and efficient method for land cover surveys in debris flow area. Based on the 2016 Landsat remote sensing image, this paper selected the tributary of Xiaojiang River-Dabaini River Basin in Dongchuan County as the research object, monitored the land cover in the basin through the remote sensing interactive interpretation and then revealed the current status of land use. The results showed that: (1) According to the land cover of the Dabaini River Basin presented by remote sensing image, the land in the basin can be divided into two categories: debris flow area and non-debris flow area. (2) The remote sensing interpretation marks were established for debris flow area. The debris flow area was divided into three sections: source section, with an area of 174.70 ha; circulation section, with an area of 94.87 ha; accumulation section, with an area of 98.74 ha. Different sections exhibited different shapes and structural features. (3) The land use of non-debris flow area was divided into four types, including 767.61 ha of cultivated land, 682.33 ha of forest land, 112.78 ha of construction land, 414.87 ha of bare land. The spatial distribution of four land use types presented a variety of features. (4) However, there was still an irrational land use in the Dabaini River Basin, such as free to occupy cultivated land and indiscriminate felling of trees which caused inefficient and unsustainable land use. This phenomenon should be controlled and improved in order to reduce soil erosion and optimize the allocation of land resources, to make the land use in the Dabaini River Basin be intensive and rational. This paper has an important scientific significance for the study of debris flow land cover monitoring and land use evaluation in the Dabaini River Basin. © 2018 IEEE.","20","Remote sensing","Debris - Land use - Rivers - Surveys - Watersheds","Construction land - Debris flows - Land cover - Remote sensing images - Remote sensing interpretation - Remote sensing monitoring - Remote sensing technology - Structural feature",,"Number: 2015FA016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41561083, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015FA016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 41561083, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Supported by: National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.41561083); Natural Science Foundation of key projects of Yunnan Province(No.2015FA016).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Substituting the MSD into the constructed model a fuzzy corresponding matrix is acquired. Next, the energy function which contains three main terms is formulated in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The first term is based on the L2estimation (L2E) criterion, and the other two terms play a complementary role to improve the robustness and accuracy for transformation estimation at both global and local scales.

Advantages and processes for global C sequestration in AF are unknown. We used a meta-analysis of 427 soil C stock data pairs grouped into four main AF systems—alley cropping, windbreaks, silvopastures, and homegardens—and evaluated changes in AF and adjacent control cropland or pasture. Mean soil C stocks in AF (1-m depth) were 126 Mg C·ha−1, which is 19% more than that in cropland or pasture. The highest C stocks in soil were in subtropical homegardens, AF with younger trees, and topsoil (0–20 cm). Increased soil C stocks in AF were lower than aboveground C stocks in most AF systems, except alley cropping. Homegardens stored the highest C in both aboveground and belowground, especially in the subsoil (20–100 cm). Advantages of AF ecosystem services focusing on mechanisms of belowground C sequestration were analyzed. AF could store 5.3 × 109 Mg additional C in soil on 944 Mha globally, with most in the tropics and subtropics. AF systems could greatly contribute to global soil C sequestration if used in larger areas. Future investigations of AF should include (a) mechanistic- and process-based studies (instead of common monitoring and inventories), (b) models linking forest and crop growth with soil water and C and nutrient cycling, and (c) accurate assessments of the AF area worldwide based on the remote sensing approaches. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","83","Ecosystems","Biodiversity - Carbon - Forestry - Land use - Remote sensing - Soil moisture - Tropics","Agroforestry - Carbon sequestration - Ecosystem services - Homegardens - Meta analysis - Sustainable land use",,"Number: 2017YFC0505100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: 2017YFC0505100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China; ","Sino‐German (CSC‐DAAD) Postdoc Scholar ship Program; Key Project from the Ministry of Sciences and Technology of China, Grant/ Award Number: 2017YFC0505100We greatly acknowledge the work carried out by the researchers, whose published data were used for this meta‐analysis.

In most CNN-based image retrieval methods, deep CNNs features are verified as discriminative descriptors for effective image representation. This paper exploits the best practice for CNNs application to national costume image retrieval. Several important aspects that affect the discriminative ability of deep CNNs features are investigated thoroughly, including layers selection, aggregation and weighting methods. Firstly, an effective weighting method for sum-pooling features aggregation is given, which is more suitable for national costume image than some typical aggregation methods such as SPoC and SCDA. Secondly, in view of the complementary strengths, compact multi-layer CNN features combined with low dimensions are proposed and proven to be effective for national costume expression. Finally, a re-ranking strategy of diffusion process is applied to further enhance the performance for national costume images retrieval. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods remarkably, which will provide some new research ideas and technical references for researchers in the field of national costume image retrieval. © 2018 Totem Publisher, Inc.

(evergreen) and Robinia pseudoacacia Linn. (deciduous) forests on the Loess Plateau, China. Fine root C, N, and N:P of R. pseudoacacia were 22, 23, and 32% greater in 40-year stands than in 10-year stands, respectively, but did not differ significantly in P. tabulaeformis stands of different ages. Fine root P and C:P of both tree species significantly differed with respect to stand age. Fine root C:P and N:P of R. pseudoacacia were lower in 10- and 25-year stands than in 40-year stands. The age-related patterns of C, N, and C:N in fine roots were similar to those in green leaves. Fine root N:P of R. pseudoacacia was positively related to soil N:P. Our results suggest that stand age (temporal factor) plays a key role in fine root C:N:P stoichiometry in temperate forests. Differences in fine root C:N:P stoichiometry between P. tabulaeformis and R. pseudoacacia suggest that the nutrient-use strategy in evergreen tree forests is more conservative than in deciduous tree forests as age increases. © 2018","55","Forestry","Landforms - Nutrients - Plants (botany) - Sediments - Stoichiometry","Ecological stoichiometry - Fine roots - Pinus tabulaeformis - Robinia pseudo-acacia - Stand age","481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 801.4 Physical Chemistry","Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: A314021403-C9, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31370455, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31570438, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China ( 31570438 and 31370455 ), the Hundred Talents Program of Shaanxi Province, the Chinese Academy of Sciences , and the Special Fund from the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau ( A314021403-C9 ).

The influence of different temperature on the mechanical properties has been investigated, revealing that high sintering temperature is benefit for the mechanical properties of samples. Experimental results also indicate that the samples show excellent performance under MHPS.

Firstly, CT and MRI images are decomposed into a set of low and high frequency coefficients by NSST, PET images are transformed into the HSV color space, and then the V component of PET image in the HSV color space. Secondly, intersecting cortical models (ICMs) are utilized to extract the edges and outlines in a larger area from the high frequency coefficients, and S-PCNNs are employed to describe the subtly detailed information in a smaller area. Thirdly, different fusion rules are designed to fuse the corresponding low and high frequency coefficients. At last, the fused medical image is obtained by the inverse HSV and NSST transformation, successively. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective, and it can fuse more information into the final images than conventional methods. © 2018","56","Color image processing","Color - Computerized tomography - Image fusion - Inverse problems - Magnetic resonance - Magnetic resonance imaging - Medical imaging - Neural networks - Object recognition - Positron emission tomography","Color space - Intersecting cortical models - Multi-sensor information fusion - Multimodal medical image fusions - Pulse coupled neural network - Shearlet transforms","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 741.1 Light/Optics - 746 Imaging Techniques","Number: 2017YJS108, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: BIOINT, Sponsor: Biological Interactions Doctoral Programme; Number: 61640306, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61365001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their careful works and valuable suggestions for this paper.

However, there still remain some challenging issues on this direction, as how to effectively exploit complex contexts to improve prediction accuracy, and how to realize collaborative QoS prediction of multiple attributes. Inspired by the principles of deep learning, we have proposed a universal deep neural model (DNM) for making multiple attributes QoS prediction with contexts. In this model, contextual features are mapped into a shared latent space to semantically characterize them in the embedding layer. The contextual features with their higher-order interactions are captured through the interaction layer and the perception layers. Multi-tasks prediction is realized by stacking task-specific perception layers on the shared neural layers. Armed with these, DNM provides a powerful framework to integrate with various contextual features to realize multi-attributes QoS prediction. Experimental results from a large-scale QoS-specific dataset demonstrate that DNM achieves superior prediction accuracy in term of mean absolute error (MAE) compared with the state-of-the-art collaborative QoS prediction techniques. Additionally, the DNM model has a good robustness and extensibility on exploiting heterogeneous contextual features.

The results show that introducing CO2 enhances biomass pyrolysis by promoting cracking of benzene ring and fracture of hydroxyl, methyl and methylene groups, which promotes tar cracking and the release of volatiles and thus increases the yield of H2, CH4 and CO. Furthermore, the density of biochar briquette decreases as CO2 content increases, while the BET surface area increases with CO2 content.

And glacier changes have great impacts on the regional climate, ecology, water resources and so on. Remote sensing images are often used to study glacial changes. For plateau mountainous areas, the images usually have a larger area of the mountain shadows. Shadows cause loss or distraction of the information reflected by the ground target, making remote sensing image difficult to understand. Therefore, the identification of glaciers in the mountain shadow area based on remote sensing images becomes a technical difficulty. In this study, a large mountain glacier on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was chosen as experimental subject. Based on Landsat 8 OLI data, this study first analyzed the reflection characteristics of different bands for glacier and non-glacier in shadow area. The results showed that due to the fact that direct light is blocked and target objects in a shadow area are mainly irradiated by the scattered light, the blue band which has shorter wavelength and higher intensity of the scattered light is preferred band for glacier identification in shaded area. For longer wavelength band, the reflectance of ground target in the entire shadow region is very low, and it is difficult to distinguish between glaciers or non-glacial regions. On this basis, a shaded glacier information enhanced index is proposed. Compared with the conventional glacier information extraction methods, the proposed method can give a result to identify the segmentation threshold more clearly in the histogram; and get the best result both in accuracy of the extracted boundary and the total area. For large-scale glacier extractionin the plateau mountainous area, it is recommended to use the proposed method which can be helpful in improving the overall work efficiency. © 2018, Peking University Press.

The catalytic performance of N-BFO nanoparticles was evaluated through the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) under visible light irradiation. 12.5N-BFO was found to be an efficient catalyst of BPA, and the addition of H2O2(10 mmol/L) or H2O2(10 mmol/L)/L-cysteine (0.25 mmol/L) can further enhance the degradation efficiency up to 60% and 94% within 120 min, respectively. The 12.5N-BFO nanoparticles were very stable during photocatalytic processes and their photo-Fenton catalytic activity can be retained even after three recycling processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","57","Catalyst activity","Amino acids - Bismuth compounds - Catalysts - Degradation - Doping (additives) - Energy gap - Image enhancement - Iron compounds - Ligands - Light - Nanoparticles - Nitrogen - Phenols - Photodegradation - Saturation magnetization - Sol-gels - Synthesis (chemical)","Adsorption capability - Bis-phenol a - Catalytic performance - Degradation efficiency - L-cysteine - Nitrogen-doped - Photocatalytic process - Visible-light irradiation","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics","Number: 2017R1A2B4010490, Acronym: MSIP, Sponsor: Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning; Number: 2017R1D1A1B03032265, Acronym: MSIP, Sponsor: Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning; Number: 2017R1A2B2012241, Acronym: MSIP, Sponsor: Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning; Number: -, Acronym: NRF, Sponsor: National Research Foundation of Korea; Number: -, Acronym: KBSI, Sponsor: Korea Basic Science Institute; ","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning ( 2017R1D1A1B03032265 , 2017R1A2B2012241 and 2017R1A2B4010490 ).

The results showed that the DC corona discharge was effective in removing COS, H2S, and dust simultaneously. As the content of O2increased, the conversion of COS and H2S decreased. O3was produced at high O2content, resulting in more energy being shared. Higher temperature is not conducive to the conversion of COS and H2S. Dust could react with gaseous pollutant or serve as a carrier under the electric field. The conversion of COS and H2S and yield of CO2were slightly improved after the dust was introduced. In contrast, a significant decrease of the yield of SO2and CO was observed. Meanwhile, the removal efficiency of dust reached 99%. In a plasma reactor, the chemical bonds of COS and H2S were broken and then further oxidized to sulfur-containing and carbon-containing products caused by free electrons, oxygen radicals, and ozone. The CO and CO2products were generated from the COS, and sulfur compounds (S, SO2, and SO42-) were a result of the oxidation of COS and H2S.

According to these investigation results, Ni-doping content has a significant impact on the control of morphology and crystalline structure, hence the as-prepared LiNixMn2-xO4 samples exhibit polyhedral morphology with high crystallinity and average size of 100–200 nm. This unique polyhedral crystal structure has numerous surfaces fitting the (111) crystalline orientation which exhibit the smallest Mn dissolution in electrolytes, whilst stabilizing the spinel framework. Owing to the merits of both single crystalline polyhedral structure and appropriate Ni-doping, the as-obtained LiNixMn2-xO4 cathodes reveal enhanced rate capability coupled with long cycling performance. In especial, the LiNi0.08Mn1.92O4 presents a initial discharge capacity of 101.3 mAh/g and ultralong cycle stability up to 2000 cycles at 1C, whilst showing enhanced cycle performance when temperature increases to 55 °C.

Quantitative analysis of these non-mineral inorganics is therefore helpful to better understand their behavior during coal utilization. Lignite samples collected from the Mile Basin in southeast Yunnan Province, China, were studied to provide further insights into the modes of occurrence of the NMIE Al, Mg, Ca, and Fe. Geochemical and mineralogical investigations were performed using a multiple analytical approach, including a three-step sequential leaching process, oxygen plasma low-temperature ashing, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (FE-SEM), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The Mile lignites have an elevated content of authigenic gypsum, which was deposited from dissolved SO42−and organic-bound or dissolved Ca. A large proportion of the Ca, Mg, and Fe in the Mile lignite occurs as dissolved salts, ionic species attached to carboxylates, and metallic species held in organometallic complexes, which were completely leached by water, ammonium acetate, and NH4-EDTA, respectively. In contrast, only a low proportion of Al in the lignite occurs in non-mineral inorganic form. Non-mineral Fe, Al, and Ca largely occur as organometallic complexes; only a small proportion of Ca occurs in a water-soluble form or in extractable carboxylates if present. Magnesium, however, occurs in various non-mineral inorganic forms, and could be leached not only by NH4-EDTA but also by water and ammonium acetate solutions. Iron is effectively leached only by NH4-EDTA and the leaching does not appear to affect the occurrence of pyrite in the coals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","52","Coal combustion","Carboxylation - Dealloying - Dissolution - Enamels - Field emission microscopes - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - Leaching - Lignite - Organometallics - Pyrites - Scanning electron microscopy - Temperature - X ray powder diffraction - X rays","Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometries (ICPMS) - Inorganic elements - Low rank coals - Low temperature ashing - Modes of element occurrence - Organo-metallic complexes","524 Solid Fuels - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 813.2 Coating Materials - 932.1 High Energy Physics","Number: B17042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB238902, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41420104001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41420104001 ), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB238902 ), the 111 Project (No. B17042), and the Yue Qi Distinguished Scholar Project.

However, the intrinsic insulating nature and large volume change during lithium insertion/extraction process lead to drastic capacity loss upon cycling. Recently, great attention has been devoted to constructing P-based composites via mixing with carbon materials. Here, a novel P/C composite, in which red P nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed in cigarette filter-derived porous carbon (CPC), was fabricated by vaporization-condensation method. Due to the unique characteristics of porous carbon, including high specific area, good conductivity, and rich internal porous structure, CPC obtained by means of heat treatment that serves as conductive matrix to load red P could be of great benefits, which can not only improve the overall electrical conductivity but also mitigate the volume expansion issues. As a result, the RP/CPC composite as an anode material for LIBs delivers a good cycling stability (500 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with a high Coulombic efficiency above 99% after 50 cycles) and rate capability (355 mAh g−1 even at 1000 mA g−1). © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","58","Lithium-ion batteries","Anodes - Bandpass filters - Carbon - Cigarette filters - Ions - Phosphorus - Porous materials - Tobacco","Anode material - Anode material for lithium ion batteries - Electrical conductivity - Environmental friendliness - Porous carbons - Red phosphorus - Theoretical capacity - Vaporization-condensation method",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Although a great deal of work has been carried out to evaluate the biomass of this group as well as its contribution to ecosystem N budgets, empirical studies are needed to confirm the N input responses by cyanolichens under climate change conditions (dry-hot stress) as well as to determine the factors that control this process. We simulated climate change conditions by transplanting Lobaria retigera, a common cyanolichen in the area, to lower elevations, and measured nitrogenase activity in response to warmer and drier conditions. In addition, we conducted a series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments to determine the dominant factors influencing nitrogenase activity in this species. The results of this study show that mean annual nitrogenase activity at the higher site was 1.5 and 2.4 times that at the simulated warmer and drier (middle and lower) sites, respectively. Combining laboratory experimental conclusions, we show that thallus water content is a key factor determining the nitrogenase activity of L. retigera in early transplantation while insufficient carbon storage resulting from a combination of warming and desiccation was likely responsible for reducing nitrogenase activity in later months of the transplant experiment.

Herein, N-doped graphene is prepared by annealing a homogeneous mixture of graphene oxide (GO) and ionic liquid of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4) in N2 atmosphere. By entrapping effect, the ionic liquid serves as both N source and restacking protectant in formation of high-quality N-doped graphene sheets. Electrochemical characterizations reveal that the obtained N-doped graphene possesses excellent electrocatalytic properties for ORR in alkaline condition with onset potential of −39 mV (vs. Hg/HgO) and current density of 5.83 mA cm−2 at −0.9 V (vs. Hg/HgO) at 2500 rpm. The microstructure of the prepared catalysts and their ORR catalytic activities are highly sensitive to calcination temperature and the optimal temperature is 900 °C. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis indicates from the atomic point of view that N atoms with different configurations contribute unequally to the ORR performance enhancement. Pyridinic N at the edge of graphene plays the most significant role in improving ORR performance owing to the largest number of active sites and lower band gap. Based on the experimental and simulation results, the beneficial properties of the as-prepared N-doped graphene for ORR are ascribed to the superior conductivity of graphene, the high N doping content and the high proportion of active pyridinic N species. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","54","Density functional theory","Catalyst activity - Doping (additives) - Electrolytic reduction - Energy gap - Fuel cells - Graphene - Ionic liquids - Metals - Nitrogen - Oxygen - Secondary batteries","1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate - Electrocatalytic properties - Electrochemical characterizations - Heteroatoms - Metal-air battery - Metal-free catalysts - Oxygen reduction reaction - Performance enhancements",,"Number: 7004689, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 7004166, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014S07, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20160428154632404, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shenzhen Polytechnic; Number: 7200397, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: South University of Science and Technology of China; Number: KQCX20140522150815065, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shenzhen Peacock Plan; Number: GRF CityU 11207414, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao; Number: 51364007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: South University of Science and Technology of China; ","This research was supported by the Hong Kong General Research Fund (GRF CityU 11207414) and CityU Strategic Research Grant (Projects 7004689 and 7004923).

The highest exergetic efficiency values of 0.39 (8.3 MVA) and 0.42 (12.5 MVA) without recovery were obtained by the application of petcoke and charcoal. The exergetic efficiency was higher in the larger capacity furnace than in the smaller furnace for the same consumption of raw materials. The correlation between exergetic efficiency and carbon materials was evaluated and revealed that the moisture content and graphitization of raw materials have a significant effect on the exergetic efficiency. The reactivity of mixtures was improved by synergistic interactions between petcoke and coal or woodchips, which increased the carbothermic reduction utilization of silica based on the higher silicon yield indicator, but reduced the exergetic efficiency and silicon actual production, as it increased the specific electrical consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","41","Furnaces","Carbon - Charcoal - Electric arcs - Electric furnace process - Electric furnaces - Operating costs - Particulate emissions - Petroleum coke - Silica","Carbon material - Carbonaceous materials - Electric arc furnace - Electrical consumption - Energy intensive industries - Exergetic efficiency - Statistical analysis methods - Synergistic interaction","451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 513.3 Petroleum Products - 524 Solid Fuels - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 911.1 Cost Accounting","Number: 51334002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51461027, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for financial support from the NSFC (No. 51334002 and No. 51461027 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
