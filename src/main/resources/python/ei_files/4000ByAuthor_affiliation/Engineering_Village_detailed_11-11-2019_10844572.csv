However, the physicochemical properties of biochar vary greatly due to its diverse feedstocks and temperatures. In addition, after being applied in soil, the quantities and characteristics of biochar change continuously under the biological and abiotic action, which will affect the migration, transformation and biogeochemical cycle of biochars in environmental systems. Obviously, predicting its long-term environmental effects through the initial state of biochar is not feasible, while most of the researches treated biochar as static component, which is not conducive to the objective evaluation of the safety and environmental effects of biochar. In order to systematically understand the environmental effects of biochar application, it is necessary to dynamically describe and monitor changes in its properties. Unfortunately, there is no approved method available to separate biochar from the soil for determining its content and properties currently. How to describe the properties of biochar in a complex hybrid system has become a major technical obstacle for dynamic understanding the affect of biochar environment. The benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) molecular biomarker method is generally used to describe the content of carbon black or high condensed organic matter in soil and deduce its combustion history. Since biochar has similar highly aromatic structural units with carbon black, the method is suitable for describing the properties of biochar in soil systems as well. It was demonstrated that the BPCA method can be used to quantitatively or qualitatively analyze the relative content of biochar in complex systems. The monomer ratios (such as B5CA/B6CA and B6CA/B4CA) can not only describe the properties of biochar, its before/post-aging (especially the degree of aromatic condensation) and deduce its sources, but also indicate the adsorption properties of biochar (before/after aging) to organic pollutants. Moreover, the BPCA molecular marker method can promote the understanding of the interaction mechanisms between biochar and inorganic minerals in soil. In addition, isotope techniques can also be a vital complement to BPCA molecular marker technology, where stable isotope techniques for BPCA monomers (i.e.13C) can more accurately describe the migration and transformation of biochar. This review summarizes the research progress of BPCA molecular marker method in biochar field, and describes the quantitative and qualitative properties of biochar in complex soil systems. The merits and dismerits of BPCA method are analyzed and its prospects are forecasted. BPCA molecular marker method is expected to be a crucial technical means for biochar environmental behavior and function assessment, and the development and maturity of this technology will greatly promote the progress of biochar research. © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

However, during the production process of a TEOLED, the hole injection efficiency and electrical conductivity may be suppressed by environmental exposure, in particular, moisture and oxygen. Given this, aluminum is an unfavorable reflective anode due to the primary concern of its native insulating oxide layer. The native oxide tends to grow during the patterning of the metal anode.

The six years of field experiments were established in a Tibetan alpine meadow. An infrared heating system was used to simulate warming, and the grazing was conducted by a combination of sheep grazing and clipping. Total and active soil fungal community profiles were determined using MiSeq sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA and RNA, respectively. Fungal abundance and rDNA transcriptional activity were analyzed through real-time PCR. The results showed that the warming significantly changed the community structure of soil fungi, particularly the active populations. Specific changes in fungal community profiles under the warming scenario included an increase in the proportion of Dothideomycetes (a potential oligotrophic class) and a decrease in the proportion of active plant-symbiotic lineages (e.g., Glomerales). FUNGuild-based functional predictions suggested that warming significantly reduced the proportions of arbuscular mycorrhizal and active saprotrophic fungi. We compared our results to those of another investigation performed at the same location, and found that the ITS-FUNGuild approach was even more sensitive than the 18S rDNA-based method with respect to identifying arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal taxa. Additionally, the warming attenuated the interactions among fungal species, reduced the Chao 1 index of active fungal communities, increased the active fungal community dispersion, and tended to suppress the transcription of fungal rDNA. In contrast, no significant effects of grazing and warming-grazing interactions on soil fungal communities were observed. These findings indicate that global warming may weaken the capacity of soil fungi to decompose organic matter and to facilitate plant nutrient absorption, whereas fungi in Tibetan alpine meadow soils are insensitive to moderate grazing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","98","Fungi","Agriculture - Climate change - Gene encoding - Global warming - Polymerase chain reaction - Soil surveys - Soils","Arbuscular mycorrhizal - Fungal community - Internal transcribed spacers - Livestock grazing - Soil fungal communities - Soil microbes - Tibetan Plateau - Transcriptional activity","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 461.9 Biology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.2 Biochemistry - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control","Number: 2016YFC0501800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: XDA20050103, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Griffith University; Number: C176220100024, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 31570518, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2016YFC0501800 ), the Strategic Priority Research Program (A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( XDA20050103 ), the start-up funding from Yunnan University ( C176220100024 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31570518 ).

As we know, the six substances AiiA, LuxI, internal AHL, external AHL, AHL substrate, and H2O2 are the core parts of the quorum-sensing system. Here, the effects of several important factors, including time delay, variable H2O2, AHL synthesis rate induced by LuxI, and AHL degradation rate induced by AiiA on the oscillatory behavior of the quorum-sensing system are studied theoretically based on a part of mathematical model describing the interaction of the above six substances proposed by Prindle et al. [Nature 508, 387 (2014)10.1038/nature13238]. The results show that the time delay is a prerequisite for inducing oscillation of the quorum-sensing system. Furthermore, the length of time delay can determine the amplitude and period of oscillation. As a further matter, the change of H2O2 concentration can induce the oscillatory behavior of the quorum-sensing system. In addition, under the regulation of H2O2, the period robustness of the quorum-sensing system is increased. Similarly, the quorum-sensing system exhibits periodic oscillation when AHL synthesis rate induced by LuxI less than a certain critical value, unless it displays a steady state. Additionally, a too-high or too-low level of AHL degradation rate induced by AiiA will fail to generate oscillation of the quorum-sensing system, only the intermediate level will cause oscillation. Finally, the two and three parameter regions in which the quorum-sensing system exhibits oscillation behavior are generated. © 2019 American Physical Society.","50","Biosynthesis","Degradation - Lutetium compounds - Time delay - Timing circuits","Bacterial synthesis - Experimental evidence - Oscillation behavior - Oscillatory behaviors - Oscillatory dynamics - Period of oscillation - Periodic oscillation - Quorum-sensing systems","713 Electronic Circuits - 713.4 Pulse Circuits - 802.2 Chemical Reactions","Number: 11572278, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors express gratitude to the anonymous referee for his/her helpful suggestions and the partial supports of the National Natural Science Foundations of China (Grants No. 11762022, No. 11562021, and No. 11572278).

The physical parameters of FGM are assumed to continuously vary along the axis-x. Two magneto-electric types of crack surface are considered, permeable type and impermeable type. A semi-inverse method is used to reduce the problem to power-series equations with the boundary collocation method employed, as numerical method, to calculate these equations in the finite region. The effects on fracture behavior of the gradient parameter, combing magneto-electric loads and two types of crack surface, are investigated. An increase in the gradient parameter is accompanied by a decrease in the ability of FGM to fracture. Increasing the magnetic load, as opposed to the electric load, promotes crack initiation and growth. Under the magneto-electrically permeable assumption, the electric and magnetic loads have no impact on the potentials field in terms of the crack singularity.

The geological structure was quantified using the existing Quaternary cross-sections from various sources. The Quaternary cross-sections were vectorised and quantified in terms of the surface of section, horizontal length and using average thickness (average vertical length). All the data were processed for the first Quaternary layer from the ground surface. Next, data were processed for the whole Quaternary geological structure. Both the types of data are important for engineering geology, particularly for civil engineering purposes. In total, 60 cross-sections of 444 599 km in length were processed. The disadvantage of quantification is the fact that the real spatial structure is not reflected. On the contrary, the advantage is the reference quantified information on the basic types of geological environment for engineering-geological purposes for designers, engineering geologists and geotechnicians.

The lasing gain medium consists of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor-acceptor dye pair Rhodamine B (RhB)-LDS821 mixture solution, which has a lower refractive index than that of the optical fiber and flows in the PDMS microfluidic channel. The circular cross section of the optical fiber forms a ring resonator and hosts high-quality (Q) whispering gallery modes (WGMs). Pumping along the optical fiber axis, the FRET characteristic parameters, i.e., the FRET efficiency η and the Förster distance R0 of donor-acceptor dye pair, are firstly studied by using a continuous wave laser as a pump light source with a wavelength of 532 nm. The excited states are thencreated in the donor (RhB) by using a pulse laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and whose energy is transferred into the adjacent acceptor (LDS821) through the non-radiative FRET mechanism. Finaly, the emission of LDS821 iscoupled into the WGM of the ring resonator to lase.

Firstly, the optimal adsorption conditions were obtained by the response surface methodology (RSM) as follows: adsorption for 136 min at 60 °C with the dosage of 0.27 g. Under the optimal conditions, the deproteinization ratio (Dr%), recovery ratio (Rr%) and selectivity coefficient (KC) were 87.35 ± 0.44%, 92.89 ± 0.41% and 12.28 ± 0.64, respectively. Then, the adsorption kinetics and isotherms experiments indicated that the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous, and were fitted well by the pseudo-second-order equation and the Freundlich equation, respectively. In addition, compared with the classical Sevag method, the PAT method was proven to be reliable. More importantly, the palygorskite was reusable and the deproteinization process produced no pollutants. These results demonstrated that the PAT method present a highly efficient and environmental friendly technique for the large-scale deproteinization of polysaccharides. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","36","Adsorption","Dyes - Pollution - Polysaccharides","Adsorption conditions - Adsorption kinetics and isotherm - Deproteinization - Environmental-friendly - Palygorskites - Pseudo-second-order equations - Response surface methodology - Selectivity coefficient","802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds","","This work was partly supported by the Jiangsu Province College Students' Practical Innovation Training Program Project (NO. 201711049003Z), Open Funds of Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Palygorskite Science and Applied Technology (NO.

How to allocate limited channel resources reasonably and reliably to each competing user is a problem that the access protocol of the MAC (Multiple Access Control) layer needs to solve. As an important way of random access, NP-CSMA (Non Persistent Carrier Sense Multiple Access) has a higher network throughput rate when the arrival rate is higher. This paper analyzes and improves the implemented NP-CSMA model, and obtains a three-slot NP-CSMA model. The mathematical tool MATLAB is used to analyze the network throughput, delay and energy efficiency of the model, and compare several random multiple access protocols adheres to the network throughput, they are NP-CSMA, Three-slot NP-CSMA, 1-persistent CSMA, P-persistent CSMA, and concludes that the three-slot NP-CSMA is significantly letter than several other multiple access protocols. Finally, using Quartus to design the three-slot NP-CSMA circuit, the statistical value of the circuit system is compared with the theoretical value of the model, and the error is less than 0.01, which proves that the system is reasonable in design and can be applied to wireless communication networks.

Based on the above characteristics, combined with numerical simulation results, the effects of aspect ratio and karst scale on the ultimate bearing capacity of bridge piles are studied by using grey theory. The results show that the ultimate bearing capacity of piles increases with the increase of aspect ratio, and decreases with the increase of karst scale. The degree of influence of karst scale is larger than that of aspect ratio.

Furthermore, skewed XCI has been reported to be related to many X-linked diseases. However, no statistical method is available in the literature to measure the degree of the skewness of XCI for case-control design. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods for such a task. Results: In this article, we first proposed a statistical measure for the degree of XCI skewing by using a case-control design, which is a ratio of two logistic regression coefficients after a simple reparameterization. Based on the point estimate of the ratio, we further developed three types of confidence intervals (the likelihood ratio, Fieller's and delta methods) to evaluate its variation. Simulation results demonstrated that the likelihood ratio method and the Fieller's method have more accurate coverage probability and more balanced tail errors than the delta method. We also applied these proposed methods to analyze the Graves' disease data for their practical use and found that rs3827440 probably undergoes a skewed XCI pattern with 68.7% of cells in heterozygous females having the risk allele T active, while the other 31.3% of cells keeping the normal allele C active. Conclusions: For practical application, we suggest using the Fieller's method in large samples due to the non-iterative computation procedure and using the LR method otherwise for its robustness despite its slightly heavy computational burden. © 2019 The Author(s).","38","Iterative methods","Disease control - Genes - Higher order statistics - Random processes","Case-control - Confidence interval - Coverage probabilities - Likelihood ratio method - Logistic regressions - Skewness - Statistical measures - X-chromosome inactivation","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2017FB002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Basic Research Programs of Sichuan Province; Number: 201612121017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 81573207, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [81773544, 81373098, 81573207], the National and Guangdong University Students’ Innovation and Enterprise Training Project of China [201612121017], and the General Program of Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Province [2017FB002].

This work exposed laboratory-fabricated concrete samples to MgCl2 solutions of various concentrations along with freeze/thaw and wet/dry cycles, with NaCl solutions as the control. The laboratory investigation revealed a new chemical mechanism during the MgCl2-induced deterioration of concrete, i.e., the formation of multi-phase nano-sized crystals, including CaCl2, Mg(OH)2, and Mg3(OH)5Cl·(H2O)4. This mechanism was further corroborated by the testing of concrete samples cored from several selected concrete bridge decks, where cumulative exposure to MgCl2 deicer resulted in significantly compromised splitting tensile strength (as high as 50%) as well as reductions in microhardness (up to 60%, often at a depth of 25 to 50 mm). This study provides new insights into the risks of MgCl2 to the concrete-built environment.

Despite there being an abundance of reports of large numbers of NPs having bioactivity in preliminary cell-based assays of anti-inflammatory potential, their further optimization and exploration are limited by the lack of a comprehensive understanding of their effective scaffold structure or biological targets. To facilitate target-based studies of anti-inflammatory NPs, the details of 665 NPs reported to have anti-inflammatory activity were extracted from the literature and compiled into a data set we termed InflamNat. The physicochemical properties of the NPs were analyzed, and the distribution of their structures and scaffolds is presented. A compound-target network was constructed from data in the PubChem Bioassay database. The results demonstrated that, compared to natural anticancer compounds in the NPACT database, compounds from the InflamNat data set contained a comparable distribution of compound types but with a higher proportion satisfying Lipinski's rule. The all-atom structures and scaffold of the compounds were diverse and barely convergent, with flavonoids and triterpenoids being the groups with the greatest abundance. The biological targets of the InflamNat compounds were identified as belonging to a variety of protein families that had varied function. Seventy-two percent of InflamNat compounds involved in the network were identified as having more than one biological target, highlighting the potential for multitarget anti-inflammatory drug development. In conclusion, anti-inflammatory NPs provide a good library for the screening of target-based leads or fragment-based drug design. Thus, elucidation of their biological targets is fundamental for either a specific single-target or multitarget drug development strategy. Meanwhile, a large proportion of the chemical space of anti-inflammatory NPs is still unexplored, with novel active scaffolds remaining to be discovered. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","27","Scaffolds (biology)","Chemical engineering - Chemistry","Anti-inflammatories - Anti-inflammatory activity - Anti-inflammatory drugs - Anticancer compounds - Biological targets - Cell-based assays - Physicochemical property - Scaffold structures",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Subsequently, a magnet-driven mesoporous silica was synthesized by in situ self-assembly in the bilayer CnmimCl-stabilized magnetic fluid using the C16mimCl as template and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as silicon source via a hydrothermal synthesis and following calcination procedure. A systematic study was carried out addressing the influence of the alkyl chain length of CnmimCl in the primary and secondary layers on the stability of magnetic fluids. The characterization of TEM, XRD, VSM, electrophoresis experiments, TGA and DTA showed that stable water-based magnetic fluids can be synthesized based on the assembly of the well-defined bilayer-CnmimCl structure with long-chain C16mimCl as secondary layer on the magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles. The results of small and wide-angle XRD, TEM, VSM, and N2 absorption experiments indicated that the nano-scale magnetic Fe3O4 particles were inlayed into hexagonal p6mm mesoporous silica (MCM-41 type) framework.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated the feasibility of low temperature oxidation in a mixed acid system of H3PO4 and H2SO4. The higher degree of oxidation corresponds to lower defects and further demonstrates that low temperature oxidation can effectively prevent defects (CO2 formation) during the preparation process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) showed that the C-O content of the as-obtained GO was increased by 10% compared with the conventional method. The microwave absorption capability of GO was investigated by measuring the dielectric properties from room temperature to ∼800 °C at 2.45 Hz. The dielectric constant ( r′) and dielectric loss factor ( r″) increase slowly from room temperature to 150 °C. In the temperature range 150 °C ∼ 450 °C for GO, r′ increases rapidly from 2.04 to 39.92, but r″ rapidly increases to 4.54 at 250 °C and remains relatively stable. As the temperature increases further, r′ and r″ slowly increase to 52.22 and 8.32, respectively. The theoretical reflection loss (RL) of the sample suggest that the maximum microwave absorption with the reflection losses of -16.72 dB can be obtained for the GO having thicknesses of 1 to 10 mm at 2.45 GHz. The calculation of microwave penetration depth (Dp) shows that the microwave absorption capability of GO can be improved at high temperatures.

A novel relative change rate of singular value kurtosis (SVK) is proposed in order to determine the reconstructed order of singular values effectively. Since the bandwidth parameter of the band-pass filter designed by FBE need to be determined based on experience, obviously, there are significant deficiencies. Then, a optimized frequency band entropy (OFBE) method based on the principle of maximum kurtosis is proposed to optimize the bandwidth parameters. In addition, because the fault signal of the rolling bearing at the initial stage is very weak and submerged by ambient noise, SVD cannot extract fault features clearly, a new method for fault feature extraction of rolling bearing based on SVD and OFBE, named SVD-SVK-OFBE, is proposed. Firstly, the Hankel matrix is reconstructed from the original vibration signal in the phase space and the noise reduction is performed using SVD. Here, the relative change rate of singular value kurtosis is performed on the Hankel matrix to determine the reconstructed order. Secondly, the OFBE analysis is performed on the reconstructed signal to determine the center frequency and the bandwidth of the band-pass filter adaptively. The bandwidth of the designed band-pass filter is optimized by the kurtosis maximum principle. Thirdly, the reconstructed signal of SVD is filtered by the optimized filter, and the envelope demodulation analysis is performed on the filtered signal. Finally, the fault feature frequency is extracted and compared with the theoretical fault feature frequency to identify the fault type of the rolling bearing. The effectiveness and advantages of the method described in this paper are verified by the simulation analysis and experimental data analysis of the rolling bearing. © 2018","38","Singular value decomposition","Bandpass filters - Bandwidth - Condition monitoring - Entropy - Extraction - Failure analysis - Fault detection - Feature extraction - Higher order statistics - Maximum principle - Phase space methods - Roller bearings - Signal reconstruction - Speed control","Bandwidth parameters - Envelope demodulation - Experimental data analysis - Fault feature extractions - Model order - Rolling bearings - Simulation analysis - Singular values","601.2 Machine Components - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 703.2 Electric Filters - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 731.3 Specific Variables Control - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 2017FA028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 201601PE00008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 14118992, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: KKSY201401096, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51465022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51465022 ), Key scientific research projects of Yunnan Province (Gant Nos. 201601PE00008 , 2017FA028 ), and Yunnan Province Personal Training Projects (Grant Nos.

Structural, electrical and magnetic properties of the LCSMO:Agx ceramics were investigated in detail. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data analyses revealed that all the samples were crystalized in the orthorhombic structure with space group of Pnma. With the increase in Ag doping (x), the grain sizes of the LCSMO:Agx samples increased and the amount of grain boundaries (GBs) decreased accordingly. At the same time, the Mn-O bond distance and the Mn-O-Mn bond angles changed correspondingly, leading to the slight increase in the lattice constants (a, b and c) and slight expansion of cell volume (V). For the LCSMO:Agx sample with x = 0.3, the optimal values of temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) and magnetoresistance (MR) reached 16.22% K−1 (265.1 K) and 42.07% K−1 (270.48 K), respectively. In addition, the fitting analysis of ρ-T curves showed that the experimental data were consistent with the theoretical calculation data. In the T MI (metal-insulator transition temperature) region, the electrical conduction mechanism of LCSMO:Agx was clarified by electron-magnon, electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering. In the T > TMI region, the resistivity data were interpreted by using the adiabatic small-polaron hopping model. Furthermore, in the entire temperature range, the phenomenological equation called the percolation model was used to explain the resistivity data and the phase-separation mechanism of ferromagnetic metallic (FM) and paramagnetic insulating (PI) phases. All the obtained results indicated that the improvement in the electrical properties of the LCSMO:Agx samples was attributed to the doping of Ag, which changed the A-site (La, Ca and Sr ions) average ion radius, the Mn-O-Mn bond angles and the Mn-O bond distance. In addition, the grain size increased, which led to improvement in the Mn4+ ion concentration and the GBs connectivity in the LCSMO:Agx polycrystalline ceramics. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","38","Calcium compounds","Ceramic materials - Curve fitting - Electrons - Grain boundaries - Grain size and shape - Ions - Lanthanum compounds - Lattice constants - Manganese oxide - Metal insulator boundaries - Metal insulator transition - Phase separation - Phonons - Semiconductor insulator boundaries - Silver oxides - Sol-gels - Solvents - Strontium compounds - Structural ceramics - Temperature","Electrical and magnetic property - Electrical conduction mechanisms - Electrical transport properties - Electron phonon scattering - Phase separation mechanism - Phenomenological equations - Polycrystalline ceramics - Temperature coefficient of resistivity","641.1 Thermodynamics - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 812.1 Ceramics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice","Number: 20180179, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018M20172230057, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This study was supported by the Nature Science Foundation Committee (Grant No. 11674135), the Innovation Training Program for College Students (Grant No. 20180179), and the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2018M20172230057).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Resin fractionation is the most widely used technique which isolates fractions based on their hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. In this study, DAX-8 and XAD-4 resins were used to investigate the relationship between hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic matters and their contributions to chemical oxygen demand in three Chinese lakes and in treated sewage. In Chenghai Lake, the average chemical oxygen demand attributable to hydrophobic organic matter was 10.20 mg/L and that from hydrophilic organic matter was 3.08 mg/L. As a proportion of the total chemical oxygen demand, they were 27 and 8%, respectively. In Yangzonghai Lake, the hydrophilic organic matter contributed 42% of the total chemical oxygen demand, while the hydrophobic organic matter contributed only about 18%. In Dianchi Lake, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic matters adsorbed by the resins were comparable. In treated sewage, on average, about 21% of the TCOD was from hydrophobic organic matter and 13% was from hydrophilic organic matter. The ratios of hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic matters to total chemical oxygen demand in the three lakes and in the treated sewage were different, indicating the differences among the three typical major plateau lakes in chemical oxygen demand contribution origin and in pollution process. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","30","Chemical oxygen demand","Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Chemicals removal (water treatment) - Dissolution - Dissolved oxygen - Hydrophilicity - Hydrophobicity - Lakes - Resins - Sewage - Wastewater treatment","Dianchi lakes - Dissolved organic matters - Hydrophilic organic matter - Hydrophobic and hydrophilic - Pollution process - Resin fractionations - Xad-4 resins","452.1 Sewage - 452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.2 Geochemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A virtual basic surgical training framework integrated with real-time force rendering has been recognized as one of the most immersive implementations in medical education. Yet, compared to the original intraoperative data, there has always been an argument that these data are represented by lower fidelity in virtual surgical training. In this paper, a dynamic biomechanics experimental framework is designed to achieve a highly immersive haptic sensation during the biopsy therapy with human respiratory motion; it is the first time to introduce the idea of periodic extension idea into the dynamic percutaneous force modeling. Clinical evaluation is conducted and performed in the Yunnan First People's Hospital, which not only demonstrated a higher fitting degree (AVG: 99.36%) with the intraoperation data than previous algorithms (AVG: 87.83%, 72.07%, and 66.70%) but also shows a universal fitting range with multilayer tissue. 27 urologists comprising 18 novices and 9 professors were invited to the VR-based training evaluation based on the proposed haptic rendering solution. Subjective and objective results demonstrated higher performance than the existing benchmark training simulator. Combining these in a systematic approach, tuned with specific fidelity requirements, haptically enabled medical simulation systems would be able to provide a more immersive and effective training environment.

The coupling effects of cyclic deviatoric stress and cyclic confining pressure on undrained dynamic behaviors are studied. The influences of cyclic confining pressure and vibration frequency on permanent axial strain and pore pressure are further analysed. The experimental results show that under undrained condition, coupling of cyclic deviator stress and cyclic confining pressure limits the development of the cumulative plastic strain of saturated soft clay to some extent. With the increasing of the slope of loading paths η and vibration frequency f, the permanent axial strain decreases. The relationships between permanent axial strain rate and cyclic time are identical under different stress paths and frequencies. The relationship between strain rate and cyclic time are more obviously affected by the slope of loading paths η comparing with the loading frequency, and the strain rate decreases with the increase of η. However, the curves of strain rate under different vibration frequencies almost coincide with each other. On the other hand, the maximum pore water pressure increases with the increase of cyclic confining pressure and decreases with the increase of vibration frequency.

Optically pumped along the fiber axis, lasing threshold properties of the RhB glycerol aqueous solution have been investigated. With the increase of both RhB dye concentration and the RI of the glycerol aqueous solution, the recorded lasing threshold decreases at first and then increases. Therefore, there is a best dye concentration as well as a best RI of the dye solution that corresponds to the lowest lasing threshold. Additionally, lasing threshold for the mixed solution of ethanol and ethylene glycol doped with RhB molecules is also demonstrated, which is much higher than that of the glycerol aqueous solution for the same dye concentration and the same RI of the dye solution.

For ease of description, these kinds of right-turn motorized vehicles are called advance right-turn motorized vehicles (ARTMVs) in this paper. The authors analyzed four aspects of traffic conflict involving ARTMVs with other forms of traffic flow. A capacity model of ARTMVs is presented here using shockwave theory and gap acceptance theory. The proposed capacity model was validated by comparison to the results of the observations based on data collected at a single intersection with channelized islands in Kunming, the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) model and the VISSIM simulation model. To facilitate engineering applications, the relationship describing the capacity of the ARTMVs with reference to the distance between the conflict zone and the stop line and the relationship describing the capacity of the ARTMVs with reference to the effective red time of the nonmotorized vehicles moving in the same direction were analyzed. The authors compared these results to the capacity of no advance right-turn motorized vehicles (NARTMVs). The results show that the capacity of the ARTMVs is more sensitive to the changes in the arrival rate of nonmotorized vehicles when the arrival rate of the nonmotorized vehicles is 500 (veh/h)2000 (veh/h) than when the arrival rate is some other value. In addition, the capacity of NARTMVs is greater than the capacity of ARTMVs when the nonmotorized vehicles have a higher arrival rate. © 2019 Bing Li et al.","27","Vehicles","Behavioral research - Highway engineering - Highway traffic control - Motor transportation - Professional aspects - Traffic signals","Capacity modeling - Engineering applications - Gap acceptance theories - Highway capacity manual - Motorized vehicles - Signalized intersection - Single intersections - Traffic conflicts","432.4 Highway Traffic Control - 901.1 Engineering Professional Aspects - 971 Social Sciences",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the TOMA method has two main limitations. Firstly, the transmissibility function defined in frequency domain necessitates Fourier transform to acquire frequency-domain data, thus leading to leakage errors and window function selection problem. Secondly, it needs multiple sufficiently different load cases to estimate the modal parameters, and how to quantify the difference between different load cases remains a problem. To remove these two limitations, this paper proposes the time-domain representation of transmissibility based operational modal analysis technique. This technique contains two methods, namely time-domain transmissibility based method and correlation function transmissibility (CFT) based method. Both methods employ the time-domain data directly and thus avoid the Fourier transform. The CFT based method combines CFT functions with different transfer outputs instead of different load cases to estimate modal parameters.

This study is aimed at improving the accuracy of soil organic matter (SOM) content estimation in arid region, and the undesirable model precision caused by the missing information associated with the larger discrepancy between conventional integer-order, i.e., first order and second order, derivative, and raw spectral data. We utilized fractional derivative (of zeroth order to second order in 0.2-order interval) processing on the field spectral reflectance (R) of the salinized soil sample from Fukang, Xinjiang, and its square root-transformed (R), log-transformed (lgR), inverse-transformed (1/R), and inverse log-transformed (1/lgR) values. The correlation coefficient of each fractional derivative of transformed value with SOM content was calculated. The simulation showed the derivative reflectance value approximates zero. When increasing from zeroth order to first order, the derivative curve gradually aligns to the first-order curve, and the destination alignment was also seen while increasing from first order to second order. The significance test of 0.05 showed initial increase and later decay of bands in the five spectral transformations as the order increases. For specific bands, the derivative algorithm clearly justifies the correlation between soil spectra and organic matter content, and all of the absolute highest correlation coefficient values were obtained at fractional orders. When compared with integer-order derivative, fractional derivative is significantly better in improving correlation, showing overall superiority. The result supports the application of fractional derivative in the hyperspectral remote monitor of SOM in arid zone, which may in turn realize the timely and accurate SOM monitor in arid zone, and provides the basis for ecological restoration. © 2019 Cheng-Biao Fu et al.","37","Soils","Arid regions - Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Organic compounds - Reflection - Stream flow","Correlation coefficient - Ecological restoration - Fractional derivatives - Organic matter content - Soil organic matter contents - Soil organic matters - Spectral reflectances - Spectral transformations","407.2 Waterways - 443 Meteorology - 444 Water Resources - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 481.2 Geochemistry - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Comparative experiments including varying the pH of the solution and the content of titania demonstrated that the 5% TiO2/ZrO2 composites (nTi:nZr = 5:100) at pH = 10.3 possessed the best photocatalytic property.

By choosing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a new set of sufficient conditions is obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which ensures the finite-Time boundedness and dissipativeness of the resulting closed-loop system. Meanwhile, the solvability condition for the observer-based finite-Time nonfragile control is also established, in which the control gain can be computed by solving a set of matrix inequalities.

With the growing accumulation of microplastics in soils, a better understanding of the impact of microplastics on soil physical properties is crucial to conserve and manage soil quality. This study explored the effects of polyester microfiber (PMF) concentrations (0, 0.1% and 0.3%) on bulk density, porosity, aggregation and hydraulic conductivity of a clayey soil from a field experiment (1 year) and a pot experiment (6 wet-dry cycles). Polyester microfibers significantly increased the volume of >30 μm pores and reduced the volume of 2 mm) in the 0.3% PMF (44%) and 0.1% PMF (39%) treatments compared to the control treatment (31%) in the pot experiment, but this was not true in the field experiment. The efficient interaction between polyester microfibers and fine soil particles and the frequent wet-dry cycles enhanced the formation and stability of macro-aggregates induced by polyester microfibers in the pot experiment. Overall, our results provide valuable evidence for microplastic influences on soil physical properties.

Attribution of this warming in recent decades has mainly been focused on anthropogenic forcing. Yet, linkages to the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), an essential part of the climate system causing decadal to centennial fluctuations of temperature, remains poorly understood for the TP, especially at long time scales. Using wellreplicated tree-ring width records, we reconstructed 358 years of summer minimum temperature (MinT) of the whole TP. This reconstruction matches the recent warming signal recorded since the 1980s, and captures 63%of the variance in 1950-2005 instrumental records. Ateleconnection fromtheNorth Atlantic to theTP is further identified based in observations and simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). We propose that half of themultidecadal variability of TP summerMinT can be explained by theAMVover the past three and a half centuries. Both observations and AGCM simulations indicate that the AMV warm phase induces a zonal dipole response in sea level pressure across the Atlantic-Eurasia region, with anomalously high surface pressure and corresponding downward atmospheric motion over the TP. We propose that the descending motion during warm AMV phases causes negative rainfall and positive temperature anomalies over the TP. Our findings highlight that the AMV plays a role in the multidecadal temperature variability over the TP. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","58","Atmospheric temperature","Atmospheric thermodynamics - Deforestation - Sea level - Temperature","Anthropogenic forcing - Atlantic Ocean - Atmosphere-ocean interactions - Atmospheric general circulation models - Multidecadal variability - Paleoclimates - Permafrost degradation - Temperature variability","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 471.1 Oceanography, General - 641.1 Thermodynamics","Number: 31570645, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31600354, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41775038, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Plan (2017YFD0600106), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31600354, 31570645 and 41775038), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

The magnetizations of untreated and microwave-treated samples with various microwave powers are analyzed using vibrating sample magnetometer. It is found that magnetite is an active material, while ascharite and serpentine are inactive materials. The heating rate of magnetite is faster than those of ascharite and serpentine, resulting in temperature gradient and internal stress among different components in Ludwigite. The effect of microwave power on the internal stress for mineral phases is positive. The internal stress significantly induces intergranular fractures and facilitates mineral liberation. After microwave treatment from 0 to 4 kW exposed for 40 s, serpentine is dissociated and the crystallinity of magnetite is increased, which leads to the saturation magnetization of samples increasing from 12.39 to 24.51 emu/g. Compared with untreated ore, the energy demand for microwave-treated Ludwigite is only about 0.44 kWh/kg, the grade of iron concentrate of microwave-treated Ludwigite increases from 48.56% to 58.06% and iron recovery increases from 69.44% to 96.35%, respectively.

These CaMKs, which were retrieved from the A. oligospora genome according to their orthologs in fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa, were expressed at a low level in vitro during mycelial growth stages. Five deletion mutants corresponding to these CaMKs led to growth defects in different media and increased sensitivity to several environmental stresses, including H2O2, menadione, SDS, and Congo red; they also reduced the ability to produce conidia and traps, thus causing a deficiency in nematicidal ability as well. In addition, the transcriptional levels of several typical sporulation-related genes, such as MedA, VelB, and VeA, were down-regulated in all ΔCaMK mutants compared with the wild-type (WT) strain. Moreover, these mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to heat shock and ultraviolet-radiation stresses compared with the WT strain.

After treatment, occlusion and shifting of the parallel SGs are sometimes reported, which could be fatal and difficult to be re-operated. These issues are highly related to the local hemodynamic conditions in the stented region. In this study, a patient case treated by the octopus endograft technique (a head-SG with three limb-SGs) and experienced limb-SG occlusion is studied. 3-D models are established based on computed tomography (CT) angiography datasets pretreatment and posttreatment as well as during follow-ups. Hemodynamic quantities such as pressure drop, wall shear stress-related parameters, and flow division in limb-SGs and visceral arteries are quantitatively investigated. Optimizations on the length of the head-SG and diameter of the limb-SGs are analyzed based on various scenarios. The results indicate that when reconstructing the flow pathways via octopus stenting, it is important to ensure the flow distribution as physiologically required with this new morphology. Position (or length) of the head-SG and diameter of the limb-SGs play an important role in controlling flow division, and high time average wall shear stress (TAWSS) around the head-SG acts as a main factor for graft immigration. This study, by proposing optimization suggestions with hemodynamic analyses for a specific case, implicates that pretreatment SG scenarios may assist in wise selection and placement of the device and thus may improve long-term effectiveness of this kind of challenging endovascular repair techniques. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","35","Shear flow","Computerized tomography - Hemodynamics - Molluscs - Patient treatment - Repair - Shear stress - Shellfish","Computed tomography angiography - Endograft - Endovascular repair - Flow distribution - Optimization scheme - Optimization suggestions - Parallel techniques - Wall shear stress",,,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The effect of HTC temperature and residence time on the chemical compositions, structure, and combustion performance of the resultant GO-assisted hydrochars was evaluated. The carbon content and energy densification increased with the hydrothermal treatment intensity accompanying with the decline in hydrogen and oxygen contents. Meanwhile, the combustion behavior of hydrochars was analyzed based on the thermogravimetric curves and isoconversional Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose method.

We systemically examined the damage morphologies of the ablation site as a function of laser pulse energy and laser shot number. Laser induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) with different periods and orientations were observed for different pulse energy regimes. Comparison of the damage morphologies and the optical transmission reveals that the two new optical transmission phenomena origin from the refraction of the incident near-infrared pulses on the LIPSS covered damage surface followed by nonlinear propagation of the beamlets and even filamentation if the laser energy was high enough. We found that the interference of the neighboring white light emissions gives rise to radially orientated optical fringes.

Sanqi (Panax notoginseng) has been severely hampered by NPSF due to the build-up of soilborne pathogens and the accumulation of autotoxic ginsenosides. Steaming on soil followed by adding biochar was investigated. Greenhouse experiments demonstrated that consecutively cultivated soil treated with steaming (90 °C for 15 min) significantly increased seed germination rates and seedling survival rates of sanqi, but biochar amendment had no effects. The combination of steaming with biochar amendments (8 g L−1) was more effective on seed germination and seedling survival rates as well as increasing the biomass of sanqi than applying steaming alone. Steaming slightly degraded the content of autotoxic ginsenosides in the soil and completely eliminated the population of soilborne pathogens, including Ilyonectria spp. and Fusarium spp., in consecutively cultivated soil, and enhanced the release of nutritive substances into soil. Biochar showed a high adsorption capacity for autotoxic ginsenosides, and increased nutrient supplementation. Steaming plus biochar could effectively eliminate the negative effects of soilborne pathogens and autotoxicants to P. notoginseng. Four years of field studies further confirmed that consecutively cultivated soil could be successfully replanted after steaming plus biochar application. Thus, steaming plus biochar amendment was a promising practice for enhancing soil quality and health. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","55","Soils","Cultivation - Plants (botany) - Seed","Agricultural production system - Biochar amendments - Ginsenosides - Greenhouse experiments - High adsorption capacity - Panax notoginseng - Soil-borne pathogens - Soilborne disease","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products","Number: 2016FB148, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017YFD0201601-5, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 31660605, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31772404, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: SQ2017YFC170021-02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); ","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFD0201601-5 and SQ2017YFC170021-02), the Major Programme for Biomedicine of Yunnan Province (2016ZF001), the Natural Science Foundation of China (31660605 and 31772404), Program for Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology in University of Yunnan Province, the natural science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FB148), Project 2015ZR01 supported by YNAU Young Scientists Found and the Young and Middle-aged Academic and Technical Leaders Reserve Programme in Yunnan Province (2017HB024).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We collected water and phytoplankton samples at 107 sites in the Dongjiang River in two seasons to assess the impact of the sub-catchments land use composition. The results showed that (1) the forested sub-catchments had higher humic-like C1 (16.45%) and C2 (25.04%) and lower protein-like C3 (22.57%) and C4 (35.95%) than the urbanized and mixed forest-agriculture sub-catchments, while the urbanized sub-catchments showed an inverse trend (4.54%, 15.51%, 33.97% and 45.98%, respectively). (2) A significant variation in the proportion of C1 and C4 between the dry and rainy seasons was recorded in both the forested and the mixed forest-agriculture sub-catchments (p 0.05). Our findings indicated that the DOM composition was strongly dependent on the land use composition of the sub-catchments and varied seasonally, but the seasonal variation pattern could be disturbed by human activities in the extensively urbanized catchments.

Although many studies revealed the effects of the p53-Mdm2 circuit on p53 dynamics, a few studies explored the contribution of upstream kinases to p53 oscillation. In this paper, an integrated mathematical model of the p53 network in response to γ-irradiation is studied, which consists of five basic components, two ubiquitous time delays, and two negative feedback loops. It is found that recurrent p53 pulses are externally initiated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and the negative feedback loop formed between ATM and p53, via Wip1, plays a dominant role in generating p53 oscillation. In addition, p53 oscillation requires not only an appropriate Mdm2 negative strength but also a threshold level of Wip1 negative strength. Furthermore, the time delays required for transcription and translation of Mdm2 and Wip1 proteins are essential for p53 oscillation. In particular, the critical value of time delay for inducing oscillation and the properties of delay-driven Hopf bifurcation are theoretically analyzed. As expected, the results are clearly in consistence with biological experiments and observations. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","32","Feedback","Gamma rays - Hopf bifurcation - Internet protocols - Irradiation - Time delay","Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated - Biological experiments - Gamma irradiation - Genetic networks - Negative feedback loop - oscillation - Oscillatory dynamics - Threshold levels","713 Electronic Circuits - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A critical need is to determine sustainable management strategies to ensure their healthy growth and provision of various ecological functions under increased drought risk due to climate change. In 2016, a field experiment was established to study the effects of juvenile thinning on carbon assimilation and water use at the both tree- and stand-scales in a 16-year old lodgepole pine stand from June to October in 2016 and 2017. This study located northeast of Penticton, British Columbia, included two thinning treatments (T1: 4500 stems per ha; and T2: 1100 stems per ha) and one control (C: 27,000 stems per ha), randomly assigned in three blocks. Sap flow and microclimatic variables were continuously monitered in one plot of each treatment in one block, while tree diameter at breast height were measured across the three blocks. The results showed that C had the lowest tree radial growth (0.14 mm2/d), sap flow velocity (64.61 g/cm2d), and highest stand transpiration (4.36 mm/d), while T2 had the highest tree radial growth (1.28 mm2/d), sap flow velocity (149.14 g/cm2d), and lowest stand transpiration (0.36 mm/d) over the two-year study period. Significant differences of tree radial growth and sap flow velocity between T1 and T2 only occurred under the drought condition (in the summer season of 2017), with T2 having a significant higher resistant index of sap flow velocity than C and T1, by taking advantage of the change in microclimatic conditions following intense thinning. At the stand-level, only the stand transpiration of T1 statistically decreased in the drought year. We conclude that the thinning plays a significant and positive role in maintaining tree growth and water consumption in the short term, and the more heavily thinning (T2) would be more effective to mitigate the drought effect in young overstocking lodgepole pine forests in terms of water consumption. These findings improve our understanding on how thinning can be used to manage ecological responses to forest practices in a changing climate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","92","Climate change","Deforestation - Drought - Ecology - Flow velocity - Transpiration - Velocity - Water supply","Juvenile thinning - Pinus contorta - Sap flow - Thinning intensity - Water process","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.9 Biology - 631 Fluid Flow","Number: CRD, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: PR2015-00635, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSERC, Sponsor: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","The project was supported by the Collaborative Research and Development (CRD) Grants from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

However, many separation materials preparations are either rather time consuming or have suffered from the need of harsh conditions. In the present study, bamboo fiber was successfully modified to acquire simultaneously super-hydrophobic and super-oleophilic properties by just two steps: delignification and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The morphology and properties of MTMS-bamboo fiber were characterized by SEM, FT-IR, XPS and the oil/water contact angles. Moreover, the durability, recyclability and the practical application of selective separation were studied. The analysis results disclosed that the special surface wetting properties of MTMS-bamboo fiber resulted from the silanization of the bamboo fiber surface, notably, from its water contact angle being 153° and oil contact angle 0°. The fiber so prepared exhibited excellent durability in several kinds of chemical solutions. The absorbed oil can be recovered by simple mechanical squeezing and the bamboo fiber maintained a high oil absorption capacity after multiple squeezing-absorption cycles. The modified fiber acted as an absorbent for hot water oil/water separation and demonstrated also a high oil separation capacity.

Taking Lake Dianchi, Fuxian and Yangzong as the study cases, the trends of water level were analysed based on Mann-Kendall statistic approach, and an index system related to fluctuations of water level were established with extreme precipitation index generated from RClimDex and other metrological index. Coupling multiple linear regression and principal factor model, a model for water level alteration of plateau lakes was built to distinguish main driving factors and their effects. Results showed that no significant trend was observed in the annual water level fluctuation of these lakes from 1988 to 2015. However, water level had a significant increase trend in Lake Dianchi at a rate of 0.025 m per year, while no trends found in the other two lakes. The extreme climate index in the lake basins had no significantly statistic trend of temporal alteration. Reverse trends of evaporations were observed in Lake Dianchi and Fuxian that have been decreasing by 21.05 mm per year and increasing by 5.52 mm per year, respectively. The trend of evaporation in Lake Yangzong was not pronounced. Variation of water level in Lake Dianchi can be explained by climatic indexes which accounted for 49.7% of total variation, indicating that water level change can be ascribed to the combined effects of anthropogenic activities and climatic conditions. By contrast, water level variations of Lake Fuxian and Yangzong were mainly influenced by climatic conditions. For Lake Yangzong, evaporation, amount of precipitation and days of consecutive precipitation accounted for 93.3% of variation of water level. Index of precipitation and dry spell can explain 64.5% of variation of water level in Lake Fuxian.

Origin of these deposits has been a matter of debate and is thought to be related to Proterozoic basement rocks, Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and the late Permian flood basalts of the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP). The Tianbaoshan Pb-Zn-(Cu) deposit contains ~22Mt Pb-Zn ores @ 1.43 wt% Pb and 10.4 wt% Zn, and ~0.1Mt Cu ores @ 2.55 wt% Cu. Copper sulfide ores are composed dominantly of chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite, whereas Pb-Zn sulfide ores consist mainly of sphalerite and galena with minor chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite. In-situ δ34S values (+3.2–+4.6‰) of chalcopyrite in the Cu ores are similar to the bulk δ34S values (+3.9–+5.4‰) of chalcopyrite separates from the Cu ores and sphalerite separates (+1.7–+3.9‰) from the Pb-Zn ores. Such a sulfur isotope signature indicates that reduced sulfur of both the Cu and Pb-Zn ores was derived from a mixed source of magmatic sulfur (derived from igneous rocks) and sedimentary sulfur or evaporated marine sulfate by thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR). In-situ Pb isotopic ratios of chalcopyrite grains in the Cu ores are similar to those of galena grains from both the Cu and Zn-Pb ores, suggesting that they have the same metal sources. Hence, our study demonstrates that both the Cu and Pb-Zn ores were co-genetic and their mineralizing elements were derived from or flowed through a mixed source of basement rocks and sedimentary rocks, and even basalts. The Tianbaoshan Pb-Zn-(Cu) deposit is an epigenetic sulfide deposit hosted in carbonate rocks and was formed from an evolving hydrothermal system from Cu to Pb-Zn. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","71","Copper compounds","Basalt - Binary alloys - Deposits - Isotopes - Lead compounds - Lead zinc deposits - Ores - Sedimentary rocks - Sedimentology - Sulfur compounds - Zinc alloys - Zinc sulfide","Carbonate-hosted - Copper sulfide ores - Emeishan large igneous provinces - Hydrothermal system - Pb isotopes - Proterozoic basement - South China - Thermochemical sulfate reduction","481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2018YDJQ009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFC0602502, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: YJRC4201804, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 41872095, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Profs.

However, there is still no consensus regarding different aspects of the chemiluminescent mechanism of this system, which impairs the development of new applications. Herein, we have used a theoretical DFT and TD-DFT approach to (i) determine the identity of the dioxetanone species responsible for efficient chemiexcitation and (ii) identify the bioluminescent emitter and determine if light-emission occurs from the fluorescent or chemiluminescent state. Our results demonstrate that upon oxygenation of the imidazopyrazinone scaffold, a dioxetanone with a neutral amide group and a cationic guanidinopropyl group is formed. This species is efficiently chemiexcited (with no obvious charge transfer step) to the corresponding oxyluciferin with a neutral amide and cationic guanidinopropyl groups. After the 'dark' chemiluminescent state, this oxyluciferin species is converted into a bright blue-emitting fluorescent state. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","50","Chemiluminescence","Amides - Bioluminescence - Charge transfer - Fluorescence - Phosphorescence - Scaffolds - Signal to noise ratio","Amide groups - Bio-imaging - Bioanalysis - Blue-emitting - Fluorescent property - High signal-to-noise ratio - Light emitters - New applications","405.1 Construction Equipment - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: CEECIND/01425/2017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: FCT, Sponsor: Fuel Cell Technologies Program; Number: 11764026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This project is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 11764026).

The LIVs' functionality could be tuned by local perturbations and structural symmetry, but achieving large LIVs is still challenging and a clear guiding principle to this end thus remains to be established. Here, a long-range lattice strain approach that enables manipulating the crystal field and symmetry breaking is proposed to realize colossal LIVs. The tailored tensile and compressive strains are introduced into superconducting (La1.45Nd0.4)Sr0.15CuO4 epitaxial films that are fabricated by the pulsed laser deposition method. The experimental characterization indicates that long-range lattice compressive strain results in the epitaxially mosaic structures and the local crystal field transition from tetragonal to octahedral configurations that spontaneously breaks the symmetry. Such a structural transition and change through modulated compressive strain could greatly favor in-plane transport that contributes to a large anisotropy of the Seebeck coefficient ΔS of over 100μVK-1, achieving strikingly colossal LIVs of over 70 V, many times larger than those of existing materials reported. This would broaden LIVs' promising application in light or photovoltage response and also exemplifies a steady route to exploring new high-performance LIV materials with structural or transport anisotropy. © 2019 American Physical Society.","42","Crystal symmetry","Anisotropy - Copper compounds - Lanthanum compounds - Neodymium compounds - Pulsed laser deposition - Strain - Strontium compounds - Superconducting films","Anisotropic charge transport - Crystal field transitions - Experimental characterization - Guiding principles - Local crystal fields - Photovoltage response - Structural symmetry - Structural transitions","708.3 Superconducting Materials - 744.9 Laser Applications - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science","Number: 11464049, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 1156402, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21773205, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51702281, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 11464049, No. 1156402, No. 51702281, and No. 21773205), the Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2015FB112), the Key R&D program of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2018BA068), and the Open Project of the Key Laboratory for Surface Physics of Fudan University (Grant No. KF2015-06).

Due to its renewability and availability in large quantities, bioenergy is considered as a possible alternative to fossil energy and attracts the attention of the world with increased concerns about environmental protection and energy crisis. The depolymerization of cellulosic substrate to monomer is the rate-limiting step in the bioconversion of lignocellulose by cellulolytic microbes. Cellulosome, a multienzyme complex from anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria, can efficiently degrade the cellulosic substrates. Previous studies have shown that the reconstitution of cellulosome in vitro and its heterologous expression or display on the cell surface can help to solve the low yield problem of cellulosome in cellulolytic bacteria. This paper reviews the research progress in the reconstitution of cellulosome as well as its application in biorefinery, including the construction of cellulosome as well as different methods for cellulosome reconstitution and its surface display.

For the reactor with digestion temperature of 60, the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) at 120h was 8797mg/L, and the ratio of C/N (presented by SCOD/TN) and C/P (presented by SCOD/TP) were 11.738.2, respectively. Thus, the digestion supernatant can meet the requirement of carbon source in the process of biological nutrient removal. Digestion temperature significantly affects the molecular weight distribution of organic compounds during sludge digestion process, and those soluble microbial by-products can be transformed into other metabolic intermediate components under thermophilic digestion condition, and the macromolecules may be smoothly converted to small molecular intermediates. As digestion time exceeded 120h, the macromolecules with Mw>100000 in the digestion substrate presented a downward trend, and the small molecules with Mw © 2019, Chemical Industry Press.

In view of this situation, a watermarking algorithm that resists combined geometric attacks and has a larger embedded capacity is proposed in this paper. Firstly, feature points from the attacked image are extracted with SURF algorithm, then they are matched with a small amount of feature points of strong robustness, which are extracted from the original image. The matching point pairs are used to estimate the affine matrix accurately and then the geometric attacks are corrected to resynchronize the embedded watermarks. Due to positioning errors introduced during the attacking/correction process, some positioning watermarks are embedded in the spatial domain to improve the accuracy of the resynchronization. Considering the excellent erasure correcting performance of LT codes, the watermark bit sequence is encoded by LT-code such that the anti-cropping performance of the algorithm can be improved. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only has a larger embedding capacity, but also is resistant to the cropping and combined attacks. © 2019, Chinese Institute of Electronics.

To promote the discovery of natural mitochondria-targeted hepatic-protectants, we established a hepatocellular mitochondria-based capturing method by coupling affinity ultrafiltration with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), which is suitable for identifying mitochondrial ligands from medicinal herbs (MHs). After evaluating the feasibility of the method, it was applied for capturing mitochondria-targeting constituents from Peucedani Radix extract. A total of 10 active compounds were identified by LC/MS, all of which were newly identified mitochondrial ligands. The mitochondria-remedying activity of 4 of the 10 hits was confirmed by pharmacological tests in vitro. Additionally, the hepatic-protective abilities of 4 hits were verified in both carbon tetrachloride-damaged liver L02 cells and mice. These results indicated that the method could be used for identifying hepatic mitochondria-targeting constituents in MHs, which might be beneficial for hepatic-protective development. © 2019 Xing-Xin Yang et al.","34","Mitochondria","Cell death - Ligands - Liquid chromatography - Mammals","Active compounds - Energy productions - Hepatocellular - Hepatoprotective activities - In-vitro - Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry - Medicinal herb - Reactive oxygen species","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry","Number: 81460623, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81660596, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81760733, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 81660596, 81460623, and 81760733), the Application and Basis Research Project of Yunnan China (Grants 2016FD050, 2017FF117-(013), 2014FA035, and 2014FZ083), and the Young and Middle- Aged Academic and Technological Leader of Yunnan (Grant 2015HB053).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
