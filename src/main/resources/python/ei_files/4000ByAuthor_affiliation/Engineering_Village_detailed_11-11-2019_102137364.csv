The proposed method is based on an image patch that is decomposed into three different independent parts: contrast extraction, structure preservation, and intensity adjustment. For structure preservation and intensity adjustment, which are very important, this paper exploits three weight measurements, i.e., local weight, global weight, and saliency weight. Using those weights, the final fused image is better guided by not only the exposure level of a single image but also the relative exposure level between differently exposed images. Then, the three parts are fused, respectively. The desired patch is reconstructed and fed back to the fused image. Unlike the conventional patch algorithms, the proposed approach preserves more details of the input sequence images due to the three weight maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully produces pleasing fused images with better color appearance and more texture details than other existing exposure fusion techniques. © 2013 IEEE.","32","Image fusion","Color - Color image processing - Digital cameras - Flow visualization - Weighing","Dynamic range - global weight - Image color analysis - local weight - Multi-exposure images - patch - saliency weight",,"Number: 61365001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61463052 and 61365001.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Moreover, it is hard for physicians to identify the scalpers due to the complexity, ad-hoc, and multiscenario nature of healthcare processes. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the identification and creation of user groups of scalpers in mobile healthcare services. The approach utilizes and extends state of the art data analysis approaches in the event-logs of the mobile system to identify user groups. Based on the user groups, user profiles are extracted by identifying representative eventcases from hierarchical user-event clusters. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted in a selected test-set from the event-logs of a mobile healthcare APP.

However, it is very challenging to fairly allocate the incremental benefits of cooperation among all participant hydropower plants, which is critical to the implementation of operation polices in practice. A methodology that combines POA-DDDP–based multidimensional search algorithm(PDMSA) with game theory is proposed to address this challenge. The PDMSA is developed to determine optimal operation decisions and obtain the multi-yearly average revenue under all possible coalitions of plants. Thus, the cooperation benefit can be accurately calculated based on the differences of generation production revenue among various coalitions. The game-theoretic Shapley method is used to find the appropriate share of each cooperating plant from overall cooperation benefits. The cooperative core based on a set of necessary conditions helps select possibly stable allocation schemes, and their stability is evaluated by the propensity to disrupt(PTD). The proposed methodology is applied to a multiple-reservoir hydropower system on Lancang River, which is one of 14 large hydropower bases in China. This case shows that the method provides the most stable incremental allocation scheme by comparison with several commonly used methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","35","Hydroelectric power plants","Game theory - Hydroelectric power - Resource allocation","Benefit allocation - Coordinated operation - Hydropower plants - Hydropower system - Multidimensional search - Optimal operation - Propensity to disrupt - Shapley","611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 912.2 Management - 922.1 Probability Theory","Number: DUT16QY30, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51579029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 91547201, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51579029 , 91547201 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds supported this research for the Central Universities ( DUT16QY30 ).

Secondly, this paper implemented the measurement scheme through Huawei's E392u-92 terminal, GPS receiver, GENEX Probe software, ENNX Assistant software, SignalLTEMap software, and personal computer, and measured the field strength value of 2.6 GHz mobile communication network of Yunnan Normal University in China. Furthermore, we present a method to calculate the propagation distance based on elevation data, and use the least-square method to correct the propagation loss model (PLM) for different propagation environments. Finally, the three parameters of mean error, root mean square error, and standard deviation are used to evaluate whether the corrected PLM is suitable for real propagation environment.

The solid deposits in the debris flow are, transported at high speed under the action of water flow and self-gravity, have a great impact on the piers along the line, which greatly destroys the integrity and stability of the pier. Through the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of debris flow, the transient dynamic response of the pier under the impact of debris flow is analyzed. It is concluded that the pier is subjected to the punching and shearing form load, and the impact damage of the coarse solid particles in the debris flow to the pier is more obvious. The pier displacement reaches the maximum at the second impact of the debris flow; the maximum displacement is 10.9mm, which appears at the 5m above the bottom of the pier. A tensile stress concentration zone appears at the bottom of the pier, and the maximum tensile stress is 1.84MPa, which exceeds the concrete strength of the pier and so we can take corresponding measures to guard against this problem so as to ensure the safety of bridge structure. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","9","Piers","Debris - Flow of water - Insulating materials - Tensile stress","Bridge structures - Concrete strength - Corresponding measures - Ecological damage - Maximum displacement - Punching and shearings - Transient dynamic response - Transient dynamics","407.1 Maritime Structures - 413 Insulating Materials - 631.1.1 Liquid Dynamics",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

But cables are generally laid underground, and the fault is not easy to be found and the recovery time is long, the reliability of power supply was seriously threatened. The traditional planned maintenance has not been able to solve the existing problems accurately. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the reliability of power distribution and reduce the failure rate by assessing the operational status of power cables through the relevance analysis of massive monitoring and testing data. This paper proposes a power cable state assessment algorithm based on association rule data mining technology from the perspective of big data and information relevance. Firstly, by analyzing the online monitoring data, detection data, experimental data, and the interrelation of the state parameters of the cable and transformer fault types, the set of cable synthetic status parameters can be set up. Then, use the association rule method to calculate the weight coefficient of each state parameters; In order to effectively avoid the influence of subjective factors on the evaluation results, weighted theory of equilibrium function was used to calculate the weight coefficient of the synthetic status parameters; Finally, combined with the existing assessment process, an accurate and objective evaluation system power cable was established. The results of the example verify the validity and accuracy of the assessment method, which provides a new novel idea for cable status assessment. © 2018 IEEE","18","Data mining","Association rules - Cables - Electric power systems - Electric power transmission networks - Electric utilities - Failure analysis - Monitoring - Parameter estimation - Reliability analysis - Telecommunication cables - Underground cables","Continuous development - Data mining technology - Power cables - Reliability of power supply - Status evaluations - Synthetic status parameters - Theory of equilibrium - Variable weight","706 Electric Transmission and Distribution - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Researchers have been studying a simply and quick way to estimate the concentration or size of nanoparticles from their optical spectra and SPR feature for several years. The extinction cross-sections and the molar attenuation coefficient were one of the key parameters. In this study, we calculated the extinction cross-sections and molar attenuation coefficient (decadic molar extinction coefficient) of small gold nanoparticles by dipole approximation method and modified Beer-Lambert law. The theoretical result showed that the surface plasmon resonance peak of small gold nanoparticles was blueshift with an increase size. Moreover, small AuNPs (sub-10 nm) were prepared by using of dextran or trisodium citrate as reducing agent and capping agent. The experimental synthesized AuNPs was also shows a blueshift as increasing particle size in a certain range. And the concentration of AuNPs was calculated based on the obtained molar attenuation coefficient. For small nanoparticles, the size of nanoparticles and surface plasmon resonance property was not showed a positive correlation compared to larger nanoparticles.

However, the quality of the collected data depends on the labelers, among which inexperienced labelers may exist and produce unexpected labels that may degrade the performance of a learning system. In this paper, we investigate the multiclass classification problem where a certain amount of training examples are randomly labeled. Specifically, we show that this issue can be formulated as a label noise problem. To perform multiclass classification, we employ the widely used importance reweighting strategy to enable the learning on noisy data to more closely reflect the results on noise-free data. We illustrate the applicability of this strategy to any surrogate loss functions and to different classification settings. The proportion of randomly labeled examples is proved to be upper bounded and can be estimated under a mild condition. The convergence analysis ensures the consistency of the learned classifier to the optimal classifier with respect to clean data. Two instantiations of the proposed strategy are also introduced. Experiments on synthetic and real data verify that our approach yields improvements over the traditional classifiers as well as the robust classifiers. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed strategy is effective even on asymmetrically noisy data. © 2012 IEEE.","64","Classification (of information)","Noise pollution","Classification system - Convergence analysis - Multi-class classification - Multi-class learning - Multiclass classification problems - Optimal classifiers - Synthetic and real data - Training example","716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 751.4 Acoustic Noise",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Cone penetration test (CPT), Dynamic Shear Rheometer test (DSR), Brookfield viscosity test (BVT) and Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) were applied to research the shear resistance rheological property, rutting resistance, high-temperature viscosity characteristics and low-temperature property of asphalt mastic. With the application of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), the mechanism of ACG imposed on asphalt mastic was analyzed. Results indicate the possibility of ACG as inorganic filler derived from solid waste to improve the performance of asphalt. The ACG has better effect on improving the shear strength and temperature sensitivity of asphalt mastic than LMF. Besides, ACG has positive effect on high-temperature properties while some negative effect on low-temperature properties of asphalt mastic.

The experimental results of three kinds of model spacers, including a regular spacer, a spacer with a novel shape, and a spacer with charge adaptively controlled are provided. AC and DC surface flashover experiments and a polarity reversal test were performed. The effect of surface charges on triggering the surface flashover phenomenon are discussed. The results show that the surface flashover voltage increases both for the novel shaped spacer and the charge-adaptivelycontrolled spacer under application of AC bias, owing to a modification of the spacer shape that increases the creep distance. However, the surface breakdown voltage is the lowest for the novel shaped spacer under DC application and polarity reversal test. The charge adaptive control spacer displayed more advantages than the other samples under application of DC bias and in polarity reversal tests owing to its superior surface charge dissipation properties.

The use of charge carriers and their spins makes it possible for spintronic devices to be used for information storage, transmission and processing. Consequently, Mn-doped Ge quantum dots(QDs) diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors, as an important part of the microelectronics industry, have aroused enormous interests because of its compatibility with current Si microelectronics and the possibility to possess higher Curie temperature (TC) than those of group - materials. The prepared MnxGe1-x QDs spintronic devices exhibit excellent performances including small size, low energy consumption, fast data processing, high integration and favorable stability, which will play a crucial role in the future development of spintronic devices. Although Mn doped group MnxGe1-x QDs DMSs materials are considered to be ideal candidates for room temperature controllable electronic spin devices and controllable ferromagnetic properties. However, the MnxGe1-x QDs DMSs materials with high performance and stability are still confronted with great challenges.. Although high TC of the system can be obtained by raising the concentration of magnetic dopant in the matrix, the solubility limit of Mn dopant in Ge is far lower than the dopant concentration which endows the system with high TC. . The high concentration of Mn dopant in Ge1-xMnx QDs is likely to cause the formation of intermetallic precipitates (Mn5Ge3 and Mn11Ge8). . Low growth temperature and low surface diffusivity are demanded for incorporating Mn into Ge under the state much higher than chemical equilibrium, while high growth temperature and high surface diffusivity are always required in self-assembly growth of QDs. Namely, achieving higher doping levels of metastable may become a breakthrough point for enhancing TC in DMSs. . The theoretical explanation of ferromagnetism, the origin of high TC and enhancement mechanism of TC are still unclear and worth further exploration. Therefore, great attempts have been made and fruitful results have been achieved by researchers in optimizing the preparation process of MnxGe1-x QDs films by selecting suitable growth parameters in recent years. . The TC of MnxGe1-x QDs is raised above 400 K. . It is defined that the TC of intermetallic precipitates (Mn5Ge3 and Mn11Ge8) are 296 K and 270 K, which tends to room temperature. . The electric-field-controlled ferromagnetism and the magnetotransport properties have been found. Electric-field manipulation of ferromagnetism temperature has been raised over 300 K for the first time, which was attributed to the quantum confinement effect. . Due to the existence of quantum effects in MnxGe1-x QDs, the modulated doping of boron (B) can increase the hole concentration in the MnxGe1-x QDs, which contributed to enhancing the TC of the MnxGe1-x QDs. This review offers a retrospection of the research efforts with respect to the MnxGe1-x diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor materials, and provides elaborated descriptions about the MnxGe1-x QDs prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). And the effects of growth parameters on the morphology and magnetic properties of QDs are also introduced. The difficulties that remain to be solved in the current research are briefly described, and the application prospects for the material in the field of microelectronics are proposed. © 2018, Materials Review Magazine.

The proposed GPR models were then compared with the support vector machines (SVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and hybrid ANFIS-particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results proved that the GPR-squared exponential model with the R-square (R2) of 0.948 can forecast D80better than the SVM with the R2of 0.83, ANFIS with the R2of 0.81 and ANFIS-PSO with the R2of 0.89. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","22","Fuzzy inference","Blasting - Forecasting - Fuzzy neural networks - Fuzzy systems - Gaussian distribution - Gaussian noise (electronic) - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Rock bursts - Rocks - Support vector machines","Accurate modeling - Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) - Blasting operations - Civil constructions - Exponential models - Gaussian process regression - Predictive modeling - Rock fragmentation","502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In order to better preserve the interesting region and its corresponding detail information, a novel multiscale fusion scheme based on interesting region detection is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the MeanShift is used to detect the interesting region with the salient objects and the background region of IR and VI. Then the interesting regions are processed by the guided filter. Next, the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) is used for background region decomposition of IR and VI to get a low-frequency and a series of high-frequency layers. An improved weighted average method based on per-pixel weighted average is used to fuse the lowfrequency layer. The pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) is used to fuse each high-frequency layer. Finally, the fused image is obtained by fusing the fused interesting region and the fused background region. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can integrate more background details as well as highlight the interesting region with the salient objects, which is superior to the conventional methods in objective quality evaluations and visual inspection. © 2018 Kangjian He et al.","34","Image fusion","Image enhancement - Neural networks - Statistical methods","Conventional methods - Infrared and visible image - Multiscale fusion - Non subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) - Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms - Objective qualities - Pulse coupled neural network - Weighted average method","723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics","Number: 61365001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61463052, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 61365001 and 61463052).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Few studies, however, focused on the method to extract and detect the contents of phenolic compounds in the stems of Dendrobium officinale, a prized medicinal plant and functional food in China. Materials and methods: In this work, a very rapid, sensitive and reliable reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was established for the separation and quantification of two phenolic compounds, i.e., quercetin and erianin in D. officinale stems, but also an optimized extraction process. Result and discussion: Results showed that quercetin and erianin were eluted before around 35 min, providing a time-saving separation. Furthermore, the steeper gradient rate in the range of 2.66–4.85% acetonitrile/min was the best for the elution. Meanwhile, the maceration of 30 min by the extraction solvent should be performed for removing polysaccharides that interfered the detection of phenolic components and resulted in the blockage of the chromatographic column, followed by a shorten ultrasonic-assisted extraction time of 30 min. The solid-liquid ratio was 1:100. Conclusions: This method is broadly applicable for chemical analyses of phenolic components in other Dendrobium species, for which similar problem may emerge. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","42","Extraction","Flavonoids - High performance liquid chromatography - Liquids - Phenols - Plant extracts - Separation - Ultrasonic applications","Chromatographic column - Dendrobium officinale - Extraction process - Extraction solvents - Phenolic components - quantification - Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography - Ultrasonic-assisted extractions","461.9 Biology - 753.3 Ultrasonic Applications - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 2017FA049, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","This study was supported by the Key Project of Yunnan Province Science Foundation [Grant No. 2017FA049].",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the mechanisms of termite mound turnover and the effects of such turnover on temporal and spatial patterns of nutrients in surrounding soils have rarely been studied. Here, we investigated the relationship between the stabilization and redistribution of soil nutrient properties and the chronological development of termite mounds (primary, secondary-occupied and abandoned mounds). The study was conducted to assess the concentrations of nutrients and water content in the biogenic structures produced by two fungus-growing termites (M. annandalei and O. yunnanensis) in different mound stages. Samples were collected along a transect at regular intervals proportional to the size of the biogenic structure. We found the concentration of NO3−in the following sequence: active mound, abandoned mound, and the surrounding soils. The concentrations of organic carbon (Corg) and total N in the active mounds were significantly lower than those in the surrounding topsoils, although a weak difference was observed with subsoils. The concentrations of Corgand total N in the abandoned mounds were significantly higher than those in active mounds, whereas no difference was observed with surrounding soils. The mean concentrations of nutrients were significantly different between fresh parts (sampling locations 1–3) and old parts (locations 4–6) of the secondary-occupied mounds. The nutrients in the fresh parts of the mound approached the values in the primary mound; whereas the nutrients in the old part of the mound approached the values in the abandoned mound. Our results indicate that nutrient concentrations change through the chronological development of termite mounds, which are hot spots of nutrients that subsequently affect ecosystem processes at specific spatial and temporal scales through the stabilization and redistribution of nutrients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","48","Nutrients","Nitrogen - Organic carbon - Soils - Stabilization","Chronological development - Fungus-growing termites - Macrotermes annandalei - Odontotermes - Physical and chemical properties - Termite mounds","483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds","Number: 2014HB042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 135-Program, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017XTBG-F01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: BX201700278, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41701029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31570622, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Mr. Liu MN, Miss Fu Y, Miss Liu JQ, Miss Chen QF and the Central Laboratory of XTBG for their help.

In this paper, our extends One-Shot Video Object Segmentation by adding two branchs for Positioning foreground targets and propagating foreground semantic information. These two branches are parallel to the existing foreground segmentation branches, which facilitates efficient iterative and fine-tuning of the foreground segmentation branches. This foreground extraction method is different from the previous background subtraction and frame difference methods. Our method does not rely on the time information and only needs to give the manual annotation of one frame, which can extract all the specific foreground in the video sequence.

The method was induced with carbothermic reduction, followed by magnetic flocculation separation (MFS) and conventional magnetic separation (CMS). The effects of reduction temperature, as well as the amount of coal and sodium carbonate on iron recovery efficiency, were chiefly introduced according to the experimental mechanism. Results of carbothermic reduction showed that iron minerals in the IOT were transformed to metallic iron at the reduction temperature of 1100 °C for 120 min, with a C/Ore mass ratio of 25% and a mass ratio of Na2CO3to ore of 8%. The reduction activity of FeO increased and a deep reduction from FeO to metallic iron was observed with the addition of Na2CO3. The metallization mean of induced reduction ores reached 32.53%. Results of magnetic separation showed that the MFS concentrate grade was 74.02% Fe, with the recovery rate at 79.51% when the reduced samples were ground to 87.4% below 38 μm. This iron recovery increased by 4.19% compared with that of CMS, whereas the iron concentrate grade slightly changed. In addition, the microstructure and phase transformation of the carbothermic reduction process were studied by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and energy-disperse spectroscopy, thereby complying with the main force analysis of magnetic flocculation in the MFS to help understand the mechanism of the novel method.

Although physically-based watershed models have been widely used to estimate nutrient emissions, connections between nutrient abatement and compliance of water quality standards have been rarely considered in NPS hotspot ranking, which may lead to ineffective decision-making. It's critical to develop a strategy to identify priority management areas (PMAs) based on water quality response to nutrient load mitigation. A water quality constrained PMA identification framework was thereby proposed in this study, based on the simulation-optimization approach with ideal load reduction (ILR-SO). It integrates the physically-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an optimization model under constraints of site-specific water quality standards. To our knowledge, it was the first effort to identify PMAs with simulation-based optimization. The SWAT model was established to simulate temporal and spatial nutrient loading and evaluate effectiveness of pollution mitigation. A metamodel was trained to establish a quantitative relationship between sources and water quality. Ranking of priority areas is based on required nutrient load reduction in each sub-watershed targeting to satisfy water quality standards in waterbodies, which was calculated with genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed approach was used for identification of PMAs on the basis of diffuse total phosphorus (TP) in Lake Dianchi Watershed, one of the three most eutrophic large lakes in China. The modeling results demonstrated that 85% of diffuse TP came from 30% of the watershed area. Compared with the two conventional targeting strategies based on overland nutrient loss and instream nutrient loading, the ILR-SO model identified distinct PMAs and narrowed down the coverage of management areas. This study addressed the urgent need to incorporate water quality response into PMA identification and showed that the ILR-SO approach is effective to guide watershed management for aquatic ecosystem restoration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","64","Water quality","Aquatic ecosystems - Constrained optimization - Decision making - Genetic algorithms - Lake pollution - Lakes - Nutrients - Reduction - Regulatory compliance - Soil conservation - Water conservation - Water management - Watersheds","Best management practice (BMPs) - Critical source areas - Metamodeling - Non-point source - Non-point source pollution - Simulation optimization - Simulation-based optimizations - Soil and water assessment tool","444 Water Resources - 444.1 Surface Water - 445.2 Water Analysis - 453 Water Pollution - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 912.2 Management - 961 Systems Science","Number: 2015CB458900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51779002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The paper was supported by the National Science Foundation of China ( 51779002 ) and National Basic Research Program of China (2015CB458900).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, most current approaches assume that the source images are noise-free, which is not usually the case in practice. The performance of traditional fusion methods decreases significantly when images are corrupted with noise. It is therefore necessary to develop a fusion method that accurately preserves detailed information even when images are corrupted. However, suppressing noise and enhancing textural details are difficult to achieve simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a novel medical image fusion, denoising, and enhancement method based on low-rank sparse component decomposition and dictionary learning. Specifically, to improve the discriminative ability of the learned dictionaries, we incorporate low-rank and sparse regularization terms into the dictionary learning model. Furthermore, in the image decomposition model, we impose a weighted nuclear norm and sparse constraint on the sparse component to remove noise and preserve textural details. Finally, the fused result is constructed by combining the fused low-rank and sparse components of the source images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","45","Image enhancement","Diagnosis - Image denoising - Image fusion - Medical imaging","Component decomposition - De-noising - Dictionary learning - Image decomposition models - Low-rank decomposition - Quantitative evaluation - Sparse representation - State-of-the-art methods","461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 746 Imaging Techniques","Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Innovative Team of Jiangsu Province; Number: 2016FD039, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Technology Sydney; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Number: KKSY201403116, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: WX069051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61572486, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Xidian University; ","We would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their detailed review, valuable comments and constructive suggestions, and thank Dr Liu, Dr Zhu for providing the Matlab codes of their methods [ 1,40 ].

We investigated the influence of vacuum distillation temperature and time on the recovery of low-grade Sb2S3. The result indicated antimony recovery could reach about 97% for suitable vacuum distillation conditions, and the purity of Sb2S3 was about 95 wt%. As for high-grade stibnite, through two-step vacuum distillation, Sb could not only be recovered in the form of Sb2S3, but also purified to commercial Sb2S3 with a purity about 99.5 wt%.

ArcGIS and the big data platform of Baidu-Map API were also used to calculate fractal dimension, in order to identify the spatial structure of urban system. There are some findings discovered in this study. Firstly, the density of urban agglomeration in the middle of Yunnan Province is decreasing while taking Kunming as the center. The urban system has a large number of blanks in the coverage of the region, and the potential spatial development of urban agglomeration is huge. Secondly, the capacity dimension is much larger than the information dimension, which shows that the topography of Yunnan High-mountain and Flat-dam restricts the spatial distribution of the urban agglomeration in central Yunnan Province, and the urban agglomeration is still in the primary stage of development. Thirdly, the cow-crow dimension is generally low, showing that the urban agglomeration in central Yunnan Province is limited by natural factors such as topography and water system. The level of traffic correlation needs to be improved.

Ground surface change challenges feature point detection in amount and quality, which is a common dilemma faced by feature-based registration algorithms. Under severe appearance variation, detected feature points may contain a large proportion of outliers, whereas inliers may be inadequate and unevenly distributed. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) feature-based multi-temporal remote sensing image registration method with two key contributions: (i) we use a CNN to generate robust multi-scale feature descriptors and (ii) we design a gradually increasing selection of inliers to improve the robustness of feature point registration.

Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+and Zn2+. The isotherms and kinetics of adsorption process were well fitted to Langmuir and pseudo-second-order model, respectively.

The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of HPACB for Hg2+estimated from Langmuir model was 1293.71 mg/g, which was close to the experimental results. Moreover, the adsorbent can be easily regenerated and the removal rate was still higher than 92% after three cycles.

While a great progress has been witnessed, most of existing skeleton-based approaches neglect the fact that only parts of the human body move in an action, and they fail to consider the ordinal positions of the body joints. In this paper, we are motivated by the fact that the category of an action is determined by local movements of body joints, and propose an attended cuboid model for skeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, a cuboid arranging strategy is developed to organize the pairwise displacement vectors among all body joints, where a cuboid representation of actions is obtained. Such a representation is well structured and allows the deep CNN models to analyze an action in a concentrated way. Moreover, an attention mechanism is exploited in the deep model, such that the most relevant features can be extracted. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-arts. © 2018 IEEE.","27","Musculoskeletal system",,"Action recognition - Attention mechanisms - Displacement vectors - Feature cuboid - Human-action recognition - Microsoft kinect - Relevant features - State of the art","461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics","Number: 61572486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61772455, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1713213, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61772455, Grant 61572486 and Grant U1713213, the Yunnan Natural Science Funds under Grant 2016FB105, the Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University under Grant WX069051, and the Project of Innovative Research Team of Yunnan Province.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Conversely, artificial muscles based on soft, smart materials possess the attributes of being lightweight, compact, highly flexible, and have mute actuation, for which they are considered to be the most similar to natural muscles. Among these materials, dielectric elastomer (DE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel exhibit considerable actuation strain, high actuation stress, high response speed, and long life span, which give them great potential for application in wearable assistance and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, there is very little research on the application of these two materials in these fields. In this review, we first introduce the working principles of the DE and PVC gel separately.

The results show that there was no significant variation in the euphotic depth (Zeu) across the four seasons, and no significant correlations between Zeu and potential influencing factors in seasons other than summer, suggesting that the water itself may be a major factor regulating the Zeu in general. Nevertheless, significant differences in Zeu between the north region (NR) and the south region (SR) were observed in all seasonal tests except spring. This finding relates to a higher abundance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the NR due to runoff, especially in the rainy seasons (summer and autumn). CDOM and its terrigenous component had an important impact on Zeu in summer, with the highest precipitation, and impacts from suspended solids and non-algal particles were also found in the NR in summer. The Secchi disk depth in the lake decreased clearly over the years, with significantly negative correlations with the increasing permanganate index and air temperature, implying that organic contaminants (CDOM and/or phytoplankton) are important regulators of water transparency. We estimate that the combined effects of climate warming and changes in land use and land cover are also indirect regulating factors. These findings should be considered in the protection of Lake Fuxian, owing to the importance of light penetration in aquatic ecosystems. © 2018","58","Lakes","Aquatic ecosystems - Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Land use - Organic compounds - Transparency","Chromophoric dissolved organic matter - Diffuse attenuation coefficients - Euphotic depth - Guizhou - Photosynthetic active radiations - Secchi disk depth",,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 41601208, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41601208 , 41325001 ), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. QYZDB-SSW-DQC016 ), the State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment (No. 2016SKL007 ), and the Yunnan Science and Technology Project (Nos. 2016RA081 , 2017FD029 ).

Because phosphate rock was chosen as the raw material from the phosphorus chemical process, its application can reduce the desulfurization cost. In addition, the produced sulfuric acid in the present desulfurization system can provide replacement of sulfuric acid required in typical phosphorus chemical activity. Accordingly, this desulfurization technology is of environmental and economic importance and also exhibits potential in treating other industrial SO2 pollution processes.

Biomass carbon materials were explored for their low cost and wide range of sources. Here, a hard carbon material with a 'honeycomb' structure using pine pollen (PP) as a precursor was successfully prepared and applied as an anode. The initial discharge capacity can reach 370 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. After cycling 200 times, the reversible capacity also stabled at 203.3 mA h g-1 with the retention rate of 98%. We further studied the sodium storage mechanism by different methods, especially the Na+ diffusivity coefficient (DNa+) calculated by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, which was more accurate. Interestingly, the trend of DNa+ coincides with cyclic voltammetry curves. Carbonized PP exhibited excellent electrochemical properties because of its three-dimensional structure and larger layer spacing (â0.41 nm), which reduces the resistance of sodium ions to intercalation and deintercalation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","60","Sodium-ion batteries","Anodes - Carbon - Cyclic voltammetry - Energy storage - Honeycomb structures - Metal ions - Storage (materials)","Cyclic voltammetry curves - Diffusivity coefficient - Energy storage systems - Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Techniques - Hard carbon - High-performance anode materials - Initial discharge capacities - Three-dimensional structure",,"Number: 51404120, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2017FB085, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC project no. 51604132, 51404120, and 51764029) and the Applied Basic Research Plan of Yunnan Province (nos. 2017FD091 and 2017FB085).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results show that Ratio operator detection results are superior to Canny operator and Steger operator. Then, the Hough change is performed on the image detected by the Ratio operator edge, and the exact position of the wire in the infrared image is extracted to prepare for the next calculation of the ice thickness. Finally, on the basis of the extracted infrared image, the calculation of the ice thickness on the ice-covered wire is converted into the solution of the image pixels. Then the image data is used to calculate the inclination of the overhead transmission line in the image, and the thickness of the ice coating is corrected. Finally,the results obtained by experiment show that the error between the calculation results of the ice coating thickness obtained by the pixel solution method and the thickness of the ice coating obtained by the numerical calculation is very small.

Such contamination is avoided here through preparing MoS2atomically thin film via direct sulfurization of molybdenum thin film on quartz plate, which permits a direct assessment of its toxicity without any contamination. Six different types of cells, including normal, cancer, and immortal cells, are cultured in the media containing MoS2thin film on quartz plates or dispersed MoS2microparticles and their viability is evaluated with respect to the concentrations of samples. Detached thin films from the quartz plates are also investigated to estimate the toxicity of dispersed MoS2in biological media. Allergy testing on skin of guinea pigs is also conducted to understand their effect on animal skins. By avoiding possible organic contamination, the low toxicity of MoS2atomically thin film and microparticles to cells and animal skins paves the way for its applications in flexible biosensing/bioimaging devices and biocompatible coatings. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this paper, the research hotspots, theme structure, and development trends of ME were surveyed based on literatures in CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure). Firstly, among all the extracted keywords, 33 high-frequency keywords representing research hotspots were identified. Secondly, the status and relationship of the research hotspots were calculated and described through social network analysis (SNA). Finally, three research themes were classified by cluster analysis, and their distribution was depicted in a two-dimensional map. In conclusion, the results show that the current research direction of ME in China mainly revolves around two main lines and three research theme areas.

Water development infrastructures are increasingly being constructed in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, which is a major concern considering its potential impact on Tonle Sap Lake. This study aimed to investigate variations in the area of the lake and discuss their possible linkage to runoff alterations in the Lancang River (Upper Mekong) by comparing runoff at the Yunjinghong hydrological station before and after significant changes in runoff trends that occurred in 2008. First, four commonly used water body extraction methods (MNDWI, NDWI, NDVI, and EVI) were compared and MNDWI was found to provide a better and more stable performance. Based on MOD09A1 data, MNDWI was used to extract the water area of the lake from 2000 to 2014, and characteristics of variations in the area before and after 2008 were analyzed. The water area of Tonle Sap Lake displayed an overall decreasing trend, and specifically decreased by 8.3% during the flood season and by 1.5% on average during the dry season after 2008. Seasonal variations in the water area of Tonle Sap Lake were dominantly influenced by runoff from the Mekong River. Compared with the period 2000-2007, runoff at Yunjinghong station were increased during the dry season (20.74%) and decreased during the flood season (34.25%) between 2008 and 2014. Changes in upstream runoff contributed to runoff at the Stung Treng station in the lower Mekong River by 6.17% (dry season) and -2.41% (flood season). Evidently, the operation of dams in the Lancang River does not primarily account for the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake during the flood season. In contrast, runoff increase during the dry season mitigates the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake to a certain extent. © 2018 by the authors.","62","Extraction","Drought - Floods - Lakes - Rivers - Runoff","Mekong River - Mekong river basins - MODIS - Seasonal variation - Stable performance - Tonle saps - Water index - Water-body extractions","444 Water Resources - 444.1 Surface Water - 802.3 Chemical Operations","Number: 41661099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the National Key R & D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFA0601601) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41661099).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

It essentially focuses on extracting or learning feature representations followed by a matching model using a distance metric. In fact, person reidentification is a difficult task because, first, no universal feature representation can perfectly identify the amount of pedestrians in the gallery obtained by a multicamera system. Although different features can be fused into a composite representation, the fusion still does not fully explore the difference, complementarity, and importance between different features. Second, a matching model always has a limited amount of training samples to learn a distance metric for matching probe images against a gallery, which certainly results in an unstable learning process and poor matching result. In this paper, we address the issues of person reidentification by the ensemble theory, which explores the importance of different feature representations, and reconcile several matching models on different feature representations to an optimal one via our proposed weighting scheme. We have carried out the simulation on two well-recognized person reidentification benchmark datasets: VIPeR and ETHZ. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Copyright © 2018 Yun Yang et al.

In the previous work of Lei and Khalil, a high-gain observer is designed for a time-delay nonlinear system taking advantage of time delay so that a constraint on lower bound occurs to high-gain-observer parameter (besides there is an upper bound on ). Unlike the previous work, in this paper the time delays are totally ignored in high-gain-observer construction. It is demonstrated that the output feedback using this high-gain observer will still semiglobally stabilise the system. In return, the is required to be sufficiently small without restriction on its lower bound (except zero and besides there is also an upper bound on ). Meanwhile, the nominal and the uncertain time delays are required sufficiently small. To pursue the essence of the distinction between these two high-gain observer design schemes, an insight is given into the theoretical analysis. Moreover, simulations are conducted in order to distinguish the specifics of features of these two schemes, which relates to the theoretical reasons. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","26","Nonlinear systems","Perturbation techniques - Time delay - Timing circuits","High- gain observers - Lower bounds - Output feedback - Semi-global - Singular perturbation method - Systems with time delay - Time delay nonlinear system - Uncertain time delay",,"Number: 61364012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China [grant number 61364012], [grant number 11361076].

However, for those traditional facial recognition algorithms, the facial images are reshaped to a long vector, thereby losing part of the original spatial constraints of each pixel. In this paper, a new tensor-based feature extraction algorithm termed tensor rank preserving discriminant analysis (TRPDA) for facial image recognition is proposed; the proposed method involves two stages: in the first stage, the low-dimensional tensor subspace of the original input tensor samples was obtained; in the second stage, discriminative locality alignment was utilized to obtain the ultimate vector feature representation for subsequent facial recognition. On the one hand, the proposed TRPDA algorithm fully utilizes the natural structure of the input samples, and it applies an optimization criterion that can directly handle the tensor spectral analysis problem, thereby decreasing the computation cost compared those traditional tensor-based feature selection algorithms. On the other hand, the proposed TRPDA algorithm extracts feature by finding a tensor subspace that preserves most of the rank order information of the intra-class input samples. Experiments on the three facial databases are performed here to determine the effectiveness of the proposed TRPDA algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","42","Face recognition","Discriminant analysis - Extraction - Feature extraction - Spectrum analysis - Structure (composition) - Tensors - Vectors","Facial image recognition - Feature extraction algorithms - Feature representation - Feature selection algorithm - Optimization criteria - rank preserving - Spatial constraints - Tensor representation","802.3 Chemical Operations - 921.1 Algebra - 922 Statistical Methods - 951 Materials Science","Number: 61402458, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61432014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61562053, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61572486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61772402, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61772455, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61562053, Grant 61572486, Grant 61432014, Grant 61772402, Grant 61772455, and Grant 61402458, in part by the Yunnan Natural Science Funds under Grant 2016FB105, in part by the Guangdong Natural Science Funds under Grant 2014A030310252, in part by the Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University under Grant WX069051, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2016QY01W0200, in part by the National High-Level Talents Special Support Program of China under Grant CS31117200001, and in part by the Project of Innovative Research Team of Yunnan province.

Recently, motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) has become an active research field where a subject's active intent can be detected. The accurate decoding of MI-EEG signals is essential for effective BCI systems but also very challenging due to the lack of informative correlation between the signals and the brain activities. To improve the precision performance of a BCI system, accurate feature discrimination from input signals and proper classification are necessary. However, the traditional deep learning scheme is failed to generate spatio-temporal representation simultaneously and capture the dynamic correlation for an MI-EEG sequence. To address this problem, we propose a long short-term memory network combined with a spatial convolutional network that concurrently learns spatial information and temporal correlations from raw MI-EEG signals. In addition, spectral representations of EEG signals are obtained via a discrete wavelet transformation decomposition. In order to achieve even higher learning rates and less demanding initialization, we employ a batch normalization method before training and recognition. Various experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed deep learning architectures. Results indicate a high level of accuracy over both the public data set and the local data set. Our method can also serve as a useful and robust model for multi-task classification and subject-independent movement class decoder across many different methods. © 2013 IEEE.","40","Brain computer interface","Biomedical signal processing - Brain - Convolution - Decoding - Deep learning - Discrete wavelet transforms - Electroencephalography - Interfaces (computer) - Long short-term memory - Wavelet decomposition","Convolutional networks - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Discrete wavelet transformation - Feature discrimination - Intelligent apparatus - Learning architectures - Motor imagery - Spectral representations",,"Number: 61863036, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61640306, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61863036 and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61640306.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Compared to polarity classification, predicting sentiment intensities for texts can achieve more fine-grained sentiment analyses. By introducing word embedding techniques, recent studies that use deep neural models have outperformed existing lexicon- and regression-based methods for sentiment intensity prediction. For better performance, a common way of a neural network is to add more layers in order to learn high-level features. However, when the depth increases, the network degrades and becomes more difficult to train. Since the errors between layers will be accumulated, and gradients will be vanished. To address this problem, this paper proposes a stacked residual LSTM model to predict sentiment intensity for a given text. By investigating the performances of shallow and deep architectures, we introduce a residual connection to every few LSTM layers to construct an 8-layer neural network. The residual connection can center layer gradients and propagated errors. Thus it makes the deeper network easier to optimize. This approach enables us to stack more layers of LSTM successfully for this task, which can improve the prediction accuracy of existing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms lexicon-, regression-, and conventional NN-based methods proposed in previous studies. © 2018","60","Long short-term memory","Data mining - Forecasting - Neural networks - Sentiment analysis","Deep architectures - High-level features - Intensity prediction - Neural models - Polarity classification - Prediction accuracy - Stacked residual LSTM - Word embedding",,"Number: 2017ZZX030, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61762091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61702443, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61702443 and 61762091 , and in part by Educational Commission of Yunnan Province of China under Grant No. 2017ZZX030.

However, it is noted that the occurring probabilities of the elements in the HFE are equal, which is obviously problematic; thus, the preference relations on the HFEs can be inaccurate. To address this issue, this paper proposes the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy preference relations (PHFPRs) based on the probabilistic HFE (PHFE). It seems difficult to provide accurate probabilities that describe the occurring possibilities of the elements in the PHFPRs. This paper further demonstrates the probability calculation method for the PHFPEs based on a proposed variable, which is called the expected consistency. Moreover, the expected consistency index and the judgment principle are designed to evaluate the degree to which the PHFPRs are consistent. For the inconsistent PHFPRs, this paper presents an iterative optimization algorithm to improve their expected consistency by optimizing some elements in the PHFPRs. When the iteration terminates, the consistent PHFPRs and the priorities of the alternatives are identified.

However, the absence of a band gap and ferromagnetic order in graphene seriously limit its applications in spintronics. How to utilize its high carrier mobility as well as mediate its electronic structure remains a challenge. Herein, we design a novel composite, which is composed of graphene and Mn-doped monolayer MoS2. The magnetic properties and electronic structures of graphene/Mn-doped monolayer MoS2 heterostructures were studied by using density functional theory (DFT) with the van der Waals (vdW) correlations (DFT-D). We found that the heterostructures show increased magnetic moments and more stable ferromagnetic (FM) states compared with that of isolated Mn-doped MoS2 monolayer. Our further studies show that many electrons are transferred to Mn-doped MoS2 monolayer from graphene, which causes the Fermi level to shift down below the Dirac cone about 0.59 eV. The transfered electrons also enhance the FM coupling between Mn ions. Graphene is partially spin polarized because of the magnetic proximity effect, which leads to the spin-dependent gaps for spin-up (16.1 meV) and spin-down (5 meV) at Dirac point, respectively. The introduction of sulfur (S) vacancy to the interface results in a much more stable FM structure and a higher total magnetic moment of the FM state; furthermore, it raises the spin polarization of graphene π orbitals and opens up a small band gap of about 7 meV. These findings propose a new route to facilitate the design of spintronic devices which both need stable ferromagnetism and finite band gap. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","63","Graphene","Carrier mobility - Density functional theory - Design for testability - Electronic structure - Energy gap - Ferromagnetic materials - Ferromagnetism - Frequency modulation - Heterojunctions - Interface states - Layered semiconductors - Magnetic moments - Magnetic properties - Manganese compounds - Molybdenum compounds - Monolayers - Spin polarization - Spintronics - Van der Waals forces","Dirac point - Ferromagnetic orderings - High carrier mobility - Magnetic proximity - Spintronic device - Spintronic materials - Stable ferromagnetism - Sulfur vacancies","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.4 Magnetic Materials - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 932 High Energy Physics; Nuclear Physics; Plasma Physics - 932.1 High Energy Physics","Number: 2013FA035, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FD017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2012HA007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11304273, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61564010, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11764047, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61564010, 11304273 and 11764047), the Applied Basic Research Programs for Youths of Yunnan Province (No. 2014FD017), the Key Applied Basic Research Program of Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Yunnan Province (No. 2013FA035), the Innovative talents of Science and Technology Plan Projects of Yunnan Povince (No. 2012HA007).","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, due to inherent difficulties in both data acquisition and data analysis methods, studies on large-scale brain dynamics of mouse with local field potential (LFP) recording are very rare. In this paper, we did a series of works on modeling large-scale mouse brain dynamic activities responding to fearful earthquake. Based on LFP recording data from 13 brain regions that are closely related to fear learning and memory and the effective Bayesian connectivity change point model, we divided the response time series into four stages: 'Before,' 'Earthquake,' 'Recovery,' and 'After.' We first reported the changes in power and theta-gamma coupling during stage transitions. Then, a recurrent neural network model was designed to model the functional dynamics in these thirteen brain regions and six frequency bands in response to the fear stimulus. Interestingly, our results showed that the functional brain connectivities in theta and gamma bands exhibited distinct response processes: In theta band, there is a separated-united-separated alternation in whole-brain connectivity and a low-high-low change in connectivity strength; however, gamma bands have a united-separated-united transition and a high-low-high alternation in connectivity pattern and strength. In general, our results offer a novel perspective in studying functional brain dynamics under fearful stimulus and reveal its relationship to the brain's structural connectivity substrates. © 2018 IEEE.","60","Recurrent neural networks","Brain - Brain models - Data acquisition - Data structures - Dynamics - Earthquakes - Electrophysiology - Hidden Markov models - Mammals - Separation - Timing circuits","Brain dynamics - Clinical neuroscience - Data analysis methods - large-scale LFP recordings - Local field potentials - Mice - Recurrent neural network (RNN) - Structural connectivity",,"Number: -, Acronym: ZJU, Sponsor: Zhejiang University; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Support Program for Longyuan Youth and Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Gansu Province; ","Manuscript received November 27, 2017; revised March 7, 2018 and August 2, 2018; accepted September 9, 2018.

Its long synthesis time and high reaction temperature, however, limit the production of its commercial product. In this work, we applied HSC Chemistry 6 software, ab initio molecular dynamics, and X-ray diffraction to investigate the thermal decomposition of AlN. We calculated the decomposition temperatures of AlN under vacuum and simulated the decomposition mechanism of AlN by the ab initio molecular dynamics method. According to the thermodynamic calculations, the decomposition temperature of AlN decreased following a decrease in the system pressure. The ab initio molecular dynamics results indicated that wurtzite-type AlN (w-AlN) was decomposed by the layer-by-layer mechanism and followed a decomposition reaction equation of AlN → Al(g) + 0.29N2(g) + 0.42N(g), which originated from the inequality sp3hybridization. The zinc-type AlN (z-AlN) decomposed from the surface to interior of the structure because of the equality of the sp3hybridization, and the z-AlN decomposition reaction equation followed AlN → Al(g) + 0.5N2(g). The AlN decomposition experiments further verified that Al(g) was the product of the wurtzite-type AlN thermal decomposition. This work can provide valuable information for the preparation of the AlN single crystal. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","36","Nitrogen compounds","Aluminum nitride - Calculations - Decomposition - III-V semiconductors - Molecular dynamics - Reaction kinetics - Single crystals - Temperature - Thermolysis - Zinc - Zinc sulfide","Ab initio molecular dynamics - Ab initio molecular dynamics methods - Decomposition mechanism - Decomposition reaction - Decomposition temperature - High reaction temperatures - Thermal decomposition mechanism - Thermodynamic calculations","546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921 Mathematics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 51474116, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51664032, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51734006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1502271, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Regional Foundation of the NSFC (51664032), the NSFC (51734006), the General Program of the NSFC (51474116), Joint Foundation of the NSFC-Yunnan Province (U1502271), the Cultivating Plan Program for the Leader in Science and Technology of the Yunnan Province (2014HA003), the Program for Nonferrous Metals Vacuum Metallurgy Innovation Team of Ministry of Science and Technology (2014RA4018), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0400404), and the Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China (IRT_17R48).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
