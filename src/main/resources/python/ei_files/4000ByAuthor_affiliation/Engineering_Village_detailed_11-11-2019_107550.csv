The method not only improves the local optimal problem of grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) but also can adaptively determine the mode number and penalty parameter of VMD. Firstly, the convex-concave decreasing strategy is introduced to adjust the decreasing coefficient of GOA. Then, energy entropy mutual information (EEMI) index is introduced to consider the energy distribution of modes and the dependence between modes and the original signal. Secondly, the optimal parameters of VMD matching with the input signal are obtained by taking the maximum EEMI as the objective function. Finally, the bearing signal is decomposed by the optimized VMD and the sensitive mode with maximum kurtosis is determined, and the fault feature contained in the sensitive mode can be extracted by envelope demodulation. The optimization experiments of 23 sets of benchmark functions show that the convex-concave strategy enhances the balance between exploration and exploitation, and the global and local search ability and stability of the GOA are improved. The experiments on simulation signal and bearing signal show that IGOA-VMD has better decomposition performance than VMD with fixed parameters and GOA-VMD. Therefore, this method provides a new idea and solution for fault feature extraction of bearing and other key components. © 2019, ICIC International.

Such searches enable the data owner to search on the encrypted data stored on the cloud without leaking any information. To obtain a better search experience, researchers have proposed many schemes which mainly focus on conjunctive and disjunctive keyword searches. However, conjunction of all the keywords may result in very few results, whereas a disjunction will return too many results. With the current schemes, customizing the relevancy of the keywords to obtain the desired results is difficult. To solve these problems, we propose a novel scheme that supports the search with the user-specified number of keywords contained in the search result. This number n can be used to customize the keyword relevancy. As a result, the data owner could obtain the desired search results containing any n keywords of a keyword set. The proposed scheme also supports the traditional disjunctive and conjunctive keyword searches when n equals 1 or the size of the keyword set, respectively. The keyword could be positive or negative. We first formally define its security and then prove that the proposed scheme is secure against the adaptively chosen keyword attack in the standard model and can defend against the offline keyword guessing attack to some extent. Furthermore, we present a theoretical performance comparison with other schemes as well as the experimental performance evaluations on our implemented scheme. © 2013 IEEE.","40","Cryptography","Search engines","Cloud securities - Experimental performance evaluations - Multi keywords - Off-line keyword guessing attack - Privacy protection - Searchable encryptions - Searching on encrypted data - Theoretical performance","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications","Number: 61863036, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; ","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61363084 and Grant 61863036, and in part by the China Scholarship Council Program.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The relatively short instrumental record of northern Pakistan makes long-term climate change assessments difficult. In this paper, tree-ring width chronologies were developed from two stands of spruce species (Picea smithiana) in the Karakoram region of northern Pakistan. The results of the correlation analysis revealed that tree-ring growth of spruce was limited by annual (June–May) precipitation. Based on the regional chronology, we developed an annual precipitation reconstruction for the period 1540–2016 CE. The precipitation reconstruction equation accounts for 40% of the regional precipitation variance during the instrumental period 1946–2016. Dry episodes with rainfall below the 477-year average occurred from 1569 to 1577, 1598 to 1612, 1621 to 1621, 1638 to 1654, 1673 to 1680, 1697 to 1720, 1728 to 1739, 1753 to 1761, 1777 to 1793, 1801 to 1840, 1860 to 1874, 1914 to 1932, 1960 to 1985, 1998 to 2011. Wet episodes occurred from 1540 to 1568, 1578 to 1597, 1613 to 1620, 1632 to 1637, 1655 to 1672, 1681 to 1696, 1721 to 1727, 1740 to 1752, 1762 to 1776, 1794 to 1800, 1841 to 1859, 1875 to 1913, 1933 to 1959, 1986 to 1997. Furthermore, the results of spatial correlation analyses show that the reconstructed precipitation represents the regional precipitation variations for northern Pakistan and nearby high-altitude mountains. The out-of-phase relationship in tree-ring records of the Karakoram region and surrounding areas suggests that the Karakoram was under the control of large-scale ocean–atmosphere–land circulations on a decadal timescale in the past centuries. In addition, by the comparison between the precipitation reconstruction and the instrumental data, we found that the drought risk of Karakoram has increased in the past 70 years and that extreme events are likely to become more severe and more frequent under the backdrop of climatic warming. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","42","Climate change","Correlation methods - Drought - Forestry - Metamorphic rocks - Rain - Water resources","Karakoram - Pakistan - Picea smithiana - Precipitation reconstruction - Tree rings","443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation - 444 Water Resources - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Thus, miRNA-disease association prediction is transformed into a link prediction problem on a MDHIN. Meta-path based similarity is used to measure the miRNA-disease associations. Since different meta-paths between a miRNA and a disease express different latent semantic association, MPSMDA make full use of all possible meta-paths to predict the associations of miRNAs with diseases.

Annual streamflow of the Lhasa River is reconstructed from Juniperus tibetica tree rings. The streamflow reconstruction developed for the southern Tibetan Plateau goes back to 1546 CE and has a R2 of 0.485. Spectral and wavelet analysis indicates the existence of decadal (34 and 16 years) and interannual (8.1, 5.7, 4.8, 3.8, 3.5, 3.2, 2.7, 2.3 and 2.1 years) cycles that may reflect climate forcings. Lhasa River streamflow is significantly correlated with precipitation over a vast part of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, and represents streamflow of the upper Yarlung Zangbo River to a certain extent. Lhasa River variation is linked with large-scale climate circulation features, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Asian summer monsoon. Some years of abnormally high and low streamflow are related to ENSO events. Based on the reconstruction, the probability that annual streamflow does not exceed a target defined as the instrumental-period mean was lower (48% non-exceedance probability) than during the instrumental period. This study indicates that the instrumental record does not contain the full range of streamflow, especially the lowest streamflow events, and the reconstruction makes up for this shortcoming. Future water resource supply planning based on the instrumental record and streamflow reconstructions will be able to effectively reduce the risks posed by climate change. © 2019","80","Stream flow","Atmospheric pressure - Climate change - Forestry - O rings - Rivers - Water supply","Asian summer monsoons - Exceedance probability - Lhasa rivers - Southern oscillation - Tibetan Plateau - Tree rings - Tree-ring reconstruction - Yarlung zangbo river basins","407.2 Waterways - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 619.1.1 Pipe Accessories","Number: 91547115, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1803341, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the NSFC (91547115 and U1803341) and National Youth Talent Support Program.

Finite element analyses are conducted on 8 kinds of sections in the composite beams with different constraint degrees. The analyses indicate the axial and bending rigidities increase with the section height of the steel beam, which lead to an increase in both constraint degrees and distributed internal forces. The final internal forces of the concrete slab decrease and the internal forces of the steel beam increase, that is, the reduced internal forces in the concrete slab are transferred to the steel beam. The variations of deflections also increase with the constrain degrees, which show the same trend when the increase of constraints.

Here, a nanocomposite thin film of tetra-sulfonated copper phthalocyanines and reduced graphene oxide (TS-CuPc/rGO) was investigated as the interfacial layer in perovskite-based photodetectors.

The isolate displayed a minimum inhibitory concentration of 84.5 mg·L−1 for Hg(II) and volatilized >86% of Hg(II) from LB liquid medium with an initial concentration of 7.0 mg·L−1 within 16 h. Hg(II) contents in soils and grown lettuce shoots decreased by 13.3–26.1% and 49.5–67.7%, respectively, with DC-F1 and/or biochar addition compared with a control over 56 days of incubation. Moreover, treatment with both bioagents achieved the lowest Hg content in lettuce shoots. Hg presence and DC-F1 addition significantly decreased the number of fungal ITS gene copies in soils. High-throughput sequencing showed that the soil fungal community compositions were more largely influenced by DC-F1 addition than by biochar addition, with the proportion of Mortierella increasing and those of Penicillium and Thielavia decreasing with DC-F1 addition.

Here, in a novel prediction approach, we developed the relevant climate niche (RCN) of plants, based on thorough selection of climate variables and implementation of a non-parametric Bayesian network for climate simulations. The RCN was conditionalized to project the fate of Silene acaulis in North America under moderate (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5; RCP4.5) and extreme (RCP8.5) short-term (2011–2040) climate scenarios. We identified a three-variable climate hypervolume for S. acaulis. Within 20 years >50% of current locations of the species will be outside the defined climate hypervolume. It could compensate for climate change in 2011–2040 through a poleward shift of 0.97 °C or an upshift of 138 m in the RCP4.5 scenario, and 1.29 °C or 184 m in the RCP8.5 scenario. These results demonstrate the benefits of redefining the climate niche of plant species in the form of a user-defined, data-validated, hierarchical network comprising only variables that are consistent with species distribution. Advantages include realism and interpretability in niche modeling, and new opportunities for predicting future species distributions under climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","55","Climate change","Bayesian networks - Forecasting - Population distribution","Climate simulation - Network likes - Non-parametric Bayesian - North America - Silene acaulis L","405.3 Surveying - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory","Number: QUEX-ESC-QP-RD-18/19, Acronym: QP, Sponsor: Qatar Petroleum; ","Qatar Petroleum (QUEX-ESC-QP-RD-18/19) supported J.M.A. J.D. was supported by National Key R & D Program of China (2018YFA0606100).

In this paper we propose an integrating-bucket method to stabilize the phase of FoFPs which is applicable to both linear phase shifting (LPS) profilometry and sinusoidal phase shifting (SiPS) profilometry. The method requires no extra modulation of the interference phase; instead, it divides the interference signal period into N (N > 2) episodes with equal time intervals and directly integrates these episodes to obtain N discrete data. By manipulating these data the interference phase can be calculated and accordingly phase disturbance can be eliminated by the feedback loop. The proposed method is as effective as the PTAC technique but at the same time more computationally efficient because the operations involved are merely add, subtraction and arctangent solution. We built a digital phase controller with the proposed method, and managed to restrict the maximum phase drift of an FoFP to within 15 mrad in 5 min for both LPS and SiPS, which is similar to the result obtained with the PTAC technique. What's more, we measured the mean value variation of the recovered phase map of a stabilized FoFP profilometer, and results are 30 mrad for LPS and 50 mrad for SiPS in 5 min. © 2019","19","Fiber optics","Modulation - Profilometry - Silicon compounds - Stabilization - Visibility","3-d shape measurement - Computationally efficient - Fringe projection - Fringe visibilities - Integrating buckets - Interference signal - Phase stabilization - Sinusoidal phase modulation","741.1.2 Fiber Optics - 741.2 Vision","Number: 2016QNRC001, Acronym: CAST, Sponsor: China Academy of Space Technology; Number: 51775377, Acronym: NNSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61501319, Acronym: NNSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61505140, Acronym: NNSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Key Research and Development Plan (2017YFF0204800), National Natural Science Foundations of China (No. 61501319, 51775377 and 61505140), Tianjin Natural Science Foundations of China (no. 17JCQNJC01100), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by Cast of China under Grant No. 2016QNRC001, Open project of Key Laboratory of Micro Opto-electro Mechanical System Technology, Tianjin University, Ministry of Education, China (No. MOMST2015-7), Photoelectric Information and Instrument—Engineering Research Center of Beijing Open Project (No. GD2015007).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A robust formation of Pt/Mn2 trimer structures is demonstrated at the bifunctional interfaces irrespective of the Ptn cluster's size, which can provide spatially separated sites for CO adsorption and O2 dissociation. The binding strength of CO at the interfacial Pt sites is in the optimal range due to the charge transfer from Pt clusters to oxide, while the strong polarization of Mn2 dimers induced by Pt clusters with stable three-dimensional morphologies can lower the energy barrier of O2 dissociation. Based on the microkinetics analysis, the O2 dissociation is the rate-determining step in the full CO oxidation cycle, and the introduction of Mn-Fe hetero-dimers at the interface is predicted to further enhance the low temperature CO oxidation activity of Pt/SmMn2O5 catalysts. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.","71","Samarium compounds","Binary alloys - Binding sites - Catalysis - Catalyst activity - Charge transfer - Dimers - Dissociation - Metals - Mullite - Nickel compounds - Oxidation - Platinum compounds - Silicate minerals - Temperature","Binding strength - Interfacial effects - Interfacial structures - Low-temperature CO oxidation - Metal oxide composite - Rate determining step - Three dimensional morphology - Trimer structure","482.2 Minerals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 801.2 Biochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers","Number: 51835005, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51871103, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51871103, 51835005, 51801067, 51575217 and 51572097), Major Science and Technology Projects of Yunnan Province (2018ZE017), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M630856).

However, owing to the visual ambiguities arising from the variability in viewing angles and illumination, and the presence of occlusions, PRID continues to present many challenges, especially when only a single image per view is available for each person. To overcome this problem, we propose a top distance regularized projection and dictionary learning (DL) model for PRID. The model incorporates both projection and DL to form a unified optimization framework to enhance the effectiveness of both these types of learning. Thus, the dictionary and projection matrix are jointly learned within this framework. In particular, the learned projection maps the coding coefficient into a discriminative space and minimizes the distance between the same persons across non-overlapping views such that the dictionary and projection can be discriminated. Moreover, we exploit listwise distances to capture all pairwise similarities. Based on this design, we derive a top distance regularization term to refine the solution space of the DL model such that the discriminative ability of the learned projection matrix and dictionary are further improved.

When samples are processed by grinding for 30 min, the residual stress value reaches a maximum of 73.13 MPa, approximately 7.2 times higher than the one obtained with untreated sample. Under these conditions, the thickness of the anodic film was abound 1200 nm, three times that of the TA2 anodic film. Furthermore, the results of electrochemical tests showed that following the surface mechanical attrition treatment, the anodic film show lower density vacancies, higher resistance to the diffusion of Cl-, higher density, and an improved corrosion resistance when compared to TA2. Generally speaking, the growth behavior of the anodic film can be improved by identifying the suitable residual stress. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","30","Anodic oxidation","Corrosion resistance - Metallic films - Nanocrystalline materials - Nanocrystals - Oxide films - Residual stresses - Surface treatment - Titanium dioxide - Titanium oxides","Anodic titanium oxides - Defect chemistry - Electrochemical test - Growth behavior - Growth mechanisms - Growth strategy - Surface mechanical attrition treatments - Surface residual stress","539.1 Metals Corrosion - 539.2.1 Protection Methods - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 51165016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51404120, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51404120 and 51165016).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Considering that recent studies have not specifically focused on this issue, the characteristics of chloride penetration in the interfacial zone of joints in precast and post-cast concrete are investigated through long-term erosion experiments in this study, wherein wet-dry cyclic exposure is used to accelerate the chloride penetration. Additionally, three interface roughness values and two durations of erosion are set as the main variables. The results indicate that the chloride content in the interfacial zone is higher than that present elsewhere and this phenomenon is termed the 'interfacial zone effect' (IZE). This is mathematically described as a GaussAmp function. The IZEs at 180 d are distinctly lower than those at 60 d. The IZEs are minor for superficial parts, but major for deep parts. Specimens with a moderate roughness have the least IZE, whereas those with lower and higher roughness both have greater IZEs.

These alkali-rich magmatic rocks include granites and syenites. The former includes granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry, and the later consists of syenite porphyry and trachyte. In this paper, we report major and trace elemental composition, zircon U-Pb geochronology and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition of these alkali-rich magmatic rocks. The zircon U-Pb dating indicates that the granites and syenites formed at 35. 1 - 36. 1Ma and 35.7 - 35. 8Ma, respectively, consistent with the Cenozoic alkali-rich magmatic rocks in western Yunnan. Geochemical results showed that the granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry belong to high-K calc-alkalic series, with SiO2 contents of 67. 92% ∼69. 93% and K2O/Na2O ratios of 0. 86 ∼ 1. 22. The syenite porphyry and trachyte belong to shoshonite series, with SiO2 contents of 53. 94% ∼63. 51% and K2O/Na2O ratios of I. 20 ∼ 2. 68. They are both enriched in alkali, K2O, light rare-earth elements (LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), but depleted in high field strength elements (HFSEs) relatively. The granite porphyry and quartz-monzonite porphyry geochemically show adakitic affinity, characterized by high Sr contents and high ratios of Sr/Y, La/Yb, but low Y and Yb contents. These geochemical signatures, along with Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions, reveal that the granites were product of partial melting of thickened mafic lower crust and the syenites were derived from direct partial melting of metasomatized lithospheric mantle with various degree of fractionation. These alkali-rich magmatic rocks in the Jianchuan area formed during the late stage of collision between Indian and Eurasian continents. The Cenozoic alkali-rich magmatism is the response to asthenospheric upwelling, following the thinning of mantle lithosphere in western Yunnan. © 2019 Eco-Vector LLC.

In this study, we report NiO decorated biomass porous carbon derived from pine nut shells as a promising microwave absorbing material by a facile strategy. The NiO/biomass porous carbon (BPC) is thermally converted from Ni(OH)2/BPC with BPC as the base for precipitation. All products were characterized by XRD, Raman, and SEM techniques, which reveals that the NiO nanoflakes were uniformly self-assembled on the surface of the activated carbon. Compared with counterparts of pure Ni(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2/BPC, a large reflection loss peak of -33.8 dB at 16.4 GHz is achieved for the NiO/BPC composites, and the absorption bandwidth less than -10 dB can reach up to about 6.7 GHz (from 11.3 to 18.0 GHz) with a thickness of 8 mm. The enhanced microwave absorption properties originate from the electric/dielectric polarization and the unique NiO decorated BPC structures. The expanded interfaces, such as NiO-NiO, Ni-BPC and NiO-paraffin interfaces in the complicated porous composites, could boost the interfacial polarization as well as related relaxation which results in enhanced dielectric loss and electromagnetic absorbing properties. In addition, NiO/BPC nanocomposites exhibit comparatively better matching of permittivity and permeability. It is expected that our present investigation could provide a new possibility for biomass based fabrication of potential microwave absorbing materials. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","71","Nickel oxide","Activated carbon - Biomass - Dielectric losses - Electromagnetic wave absorption - Microwaves - Polarization - Porous materials","Electromagnetic absorbing - Interfacial polarization - Microwave absorbing materials - Microwave absorption properties - Pine nut shells - Porous carbons - Porous composites - Reflection loss","708.1 Dielectric Materials - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 951 Materials Science",,,"Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Few studies have quantitatively analyzed the relationship between intensification and pollutant nutrient emissions in Chinese hog production. In this study, we first propose an analytical framework from which we determine the effect of intensification on pollutant nutrient emissions, and deduce the theoretical hypothesis. Then, based on a microeconomic survey data set of 754 hog farms from five provinces in China, we provide a careful empirical analysis to verify the proposed hypothesis using ordinary least squares (OLS) and instrumental-variable two-stage least squares (IV-2SLS) regression models. The empirical results show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between intensification and pollutant nutrient emissions, and that medium-scale hog farms perform the worst from an environmental point of view. The degree of integration of crop and hog production, environmental regulation, and financial capacity are the main mechanisms responsible for the inverted U-shaped curve. We suggest that enhancing environmental performance in the intensification of hog production requires having fewer farms with a higher production density, because this will cause less environmental damage than having a higher number of farms with a lower production density. Our conclusions provide an important scientific basis for the sustainable intensification of livestock production in China, as well as in other countries confronting a similar situation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","47","Environmental regulations","Agriculture - Climate change - Environmental management - Nutrients - Pollution - Regression analysis","China - Environmental damage - Environmental performance - Instrumental variables - Intensification - Livestock production - Ordinary least squares - Two stage least squares",,"Number: 71303099, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015YZD16, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; ","We would like to thank the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71673123 ; No. 71303099 ; No. 41461118 ; No. 71362014 ) the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 2015YZD16 ), and Research Center on Low-carbon Economy for Guangzhou Region .

Hydrochloric acid-extracted pectin (HEP) and chelating agent-extracted pectin (ChEP) satisfy the commercial pectin requirements (GalA% > 65%) and are smooth pectin with high homogalacturonan segments (70.6 and 65.4%, respectively). As the structure results suggest, HEP has fewer and shorter branches compared with ChEP. As titration results suggest, gallotannin is bound by pectin and forms insoluble gallotannin–pectin complexes, the maximum combination gallotannin to pectin mass ratios are 0.28 and 0.47 for HEP and ChEP, respectively. Yet as distribution of volume-weighted diameter, micrographs and values of surface-weighted diameter suggest, the emulsions stabilized by HEP show better stability than ChEP.

Based on numerous computation simulations, it is unveiled that compared with the setup of multigame, coevolution mechanism can effectively resolve the problem of collective cooperation. While for this observation, it is attributed to the fact that vast majority of players changed their games to snowdrift game (i.e. lower social dilemma), where cooperation-defection bistable state guarantees cooperation clusters.

By analyzing the solutions, we find the transition phenomenon when the dimension of Lévy path changes from integer to non-integer: the energy changes from discrete to continuous and wave functions change from non-degenerate to degenerate. Then we study the effect of the minimal length on the fractional Schrödinger equation in the Earth's gravitational field and the solutions. We find that the presence of the minimal length brings a perturbation to the Hamiltonian in equation but it does not change the transition phenomenon. Based on these result, we prove the existence of bound states in the continuum (BICs) for the fractional quantum system in the Earth's gravitational field and compare our BICs with those previous ones.

First, the delay summation in the main channel is replaced by the linear filtering algorithm, which is beneficial to further improving the suppression ability of incoherent noise. Second, by considering the difference in signal energy among channels, using the optimized blocking matrix can reduce the amplitude of the desired signal and improve the performance, comparing to the original blocking matrix obtained by simple subtraction among the main channels. Finally, the method using linear filtering instead of the original adaptive algorithm can achieve noise cancellation without reducing the sensitivity of the main antenna and improve the algorithm's operating speed. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, an experimental platform is set up in laboratory environment and a series of control experiments are designed. Experimental results show that the designed analog circuits can suppress 50 Hz and its harmonic components and that the improved GSC algorithm is better than the original algorithm in terms of improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) and the noise floor. © 2019, The Editorial Board of Journal of Xidian University.

The bright loop-like structures in the corona, which are called coronal loops, are hot plasma to be bound to the solar coronal magnetic fields. Studying these magnetic features can help to better understand the dynamics of coronal magnetic fields and coronal oscillations, and further clearify the debate of coronal heating. Accurate identifying coronal loops are crucial for the relevant studies. However, due to the complexity of the coronal magnetic fields, it is very difficult to identify and extract the loop-like structures. In this case, we propose a novel algorithm based on guided filtering and wavelet transform modulus maxima to automatically detect and extract them. The steps are as follows: we use (1) a fuzzy function to enhance the contrast of solar corona images; (2) guided filtering to highlight the edges of coronal loops; (3) wavelet transform modulus maxima to identitify the edges of coronal loops; (4) image binarization to extract coronal loops; (5) morphological operate to remove those non-loop structures. The images observed by the Transition and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics (SDO/AIA) intruments in the 171 Å channel are selected to illustrate the porcess and further evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages over provious identification methods and the detected and extracted structures can be further applied to scientific researchs. © 2019, Science Press.

Two different surfactants of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) are added to improve the stability of Al2O3- EG nanofluids. Firstly, sedimentation observation and TEM images confirm its stability and observe inherent morphology. Secondly, the ratio of surfactant mass fraction to volume fraction of nanofluid (ωpvp/φ) is optimized by measuring viscosity and thermal conductivity. Thirdly, two different evaluated criteria based on properties enhancement ratio (PER) and figure of merit (FOM) are used to assess the overall thermal performance of nanofluids under single phase forced convective flow. The results show that, according to TEM images and quantitatively calculated by the velocity ratio (uB/ut) of the Brownian to settling velocity ratio of nanoparticles, Al2O3 - EG nanofluids with PVP surfactant provide the best stable suspensions due to polymeric chain interaction. With the increase in PVP surfactant concentration, both viscosity and thermal conductivity firstly increase up to a maximum value, after which, it decreases. There is an optimum PVP concentration (ωpvp/φ = 0.15 for 1.0 vol% Al2O3- EG nanofluids) resulting in the highest thermal conductivity and relative low viscosity. From evaluated criteria, Al2O3-EG nanofluids with ωpvp/φ ratio ranged from 0 to 0.15 and temperature below 50 °C can be considered as efficient working fluids under the laminar and turbulent forced convective process. Therefore, this nanofluid is a promising approach for energy management in the low temperature waste heat recovery system. © 2018","33","Nanofluidics","Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Convergence of numerical methods - Energy efficiency - Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Sodium dodecyl sulfate - Stability - Sulfur compounds - Temperature - Thermal conductivity of liquids - Velocity - Viscosity - Volume fraction - Waste heat - Waste heat utilization - Waste management","Figure of merit (FOM) - Forced convective flows - Low-temperature waste heats - Nanofluids - Performance evaluations - Surfactant concentrations - Thermal Performance - Thermo-physical parameters","525 Energy Management and Conversion - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 761 Nanotechnology - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921.6 Numerical Methods","Number: 2016YFB0600201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FD035, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51666006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (No. 2016FD035 ), National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFB0600201 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51666006 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Interestingly, we find that interdependence by means of asymmetric information sharing function can dramatically promote the evolution of cooperation by restraining negative feed-back effect to provide a better environment for cooperators to mushroom. The result shows that the stronger the level of asymmetry, the higher the level of cooperation. And we further inquiry why this asymmetric information sharing updating mechanism can strikingly promote the cooperation in the upper network and find that the value of combined Fermi–Dirac Function of defector in the upper network is relatively larger than the original Fermi–Dirac Function, which can eventually lead to the fraction of cooperation to one in the upper network.

In this study, N-hexadecanoylglycine (C16Gly) was used as a collector in the flotation system of fluorapatite (FA) and dolomite. Microflotation tests using single minerals implied that C16Gly could be applied as an efficient collector for FA over dolomite at pH 9 and 11. Zeta potential analyses indicated that the C16Gly anion was preferentially adsorbed onto the FA surface at pH 9. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the C16Gly ion could bind to two metal atoms on the dolomite surface in a bidentate fashion. On the other hand, the C16Gly ion interacted with two calcium atoms on the FA surface to generate tridentate binding structures. In these tridentate binding models, hydrogen bonding between the NH of C16Gly and PO4 groups occurred on the FA surface. Adsorption of the C16Gly ion on the FA surface through tridentate binding was significantly favored over bidentate binding to dolomite surface.

In NMR spectra and LC-MS data collected on a series of metabolite mixtures, signals of the same individual metabolite are quantitatively correlated, based on the fact that NMR and LC-MS signals are derived from the same metabolite covary. Deconvoluting NMR spectra and LC-MS data of the mixtures through this kind of statistical correlation, NMR and LC-MS spectra of individual metabolites can be obtained as if the specific metabolite is virtually isolated from the mixture. Integrating NMR and LC-MS spectra, more abundant and orthogonal information on the same compound can significantly facilitate the identification of individual metabolites in the mixture. This strategy was demonstrated by deconvoluting 1D 13C, DEPT, HSQC, TOCSY, and LC-MS spectra acquired on 10 mixtures consisting of 6 typical metabolites with varying concentration. Based on statistical correlation analysis, NMR and LC-MS signals of individual metabolites in the mixtures can be extracted as if their spectra are acquired on the purified metabolite, which notably facilitates structure identification. Statistically correlating NMR spectra and LC-MS data (CoNaM) may represent a novel approach to identification of individual compounds in a mixture. The success of this strategy on the synthetic metabolite mixtures encourages application of the proposed strategy of CoNaM to biological samples (such as serum and cell extracts) in metabolomics studies to facilitate identification of potential biomarkers.

Based on the complex velocity model, the fast sweeping method (FSM) is an algorithm to calculate the first arrival time of the seismic wave by using the eikonal equation. This method has been widely applied in the fields of earthquake localization and geophysical exploration. In this study, this method was introduced in the field of microseismic monitoring in geotechnical engineering. Especially for layered velocity models, a fast localization technique was established based on the fast sweeping method (FSM). Firstly, the fast sweeping method (FSM) in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system was proposed to calculate the initial travel time of the point source in the single velocity model and horizontal layered velocity model. Compared with the theoretical solution, the accuracy of the algorithm and its error distribution characteristics were analyzed. The travel time results calculated by the fast sweeping method (FSM) and theoretical solutions were compared to analyze the algorithm precision and error distribution characteristics. Secondly, a rapid seismic source localization technique was put forward for the layered velocity model based on the database of the arrival time differences which were calculated by fast sweeping method (FSM). Finally, the positioning accuracy and computational efficiency between the new localization technique and traditional method based on the isotropy velocity model were compared and analyzed. This study showed that the proposed technique for the layered velocity model presented a favorable accuracy and computational efficiency, and also reduced the location time significantly compared with traditional location methods. The technique can provide significant theoretical and technical support for the microseismic source localization in complex layer and acoustic emission monitoring in the laboratory. © 2019, Science Press.

Firstly, the 10/35 kV ferroresonance simulation circuits based on PSCAD/EMTDC software were founded in this paper and the calculated results show that the PT current waveform under the fundamental resonance behaves the distinct characteristic with respect to the normal current waveform, which can be used to recognize the fundamental resonance. Then a secondary elimination control model based on the combined detection of the zero-sequence voltage and PT current was established, specifically with which it could be controlled to close the switch device by detecting the zero-sequence voltage combined with PT current, and to open the switch device by detecting the PT open-delta current combined with the Joule heat of the damping resistor. Furthermore, the influence of the damping resistances and the threshold value of PT open-delta current on effectiveness of anti-ferroresonance were discussed and the appropriate ranges of the two values were given correspondingly. Finally, the validity of this secondary resonance elimination method has been verified by the simulating experiments in the testing platforms and the substation. © 2019 IEEE.","11","Magnetic resonance","Computer software - Damping","Combined detections - Fundamental resonance - Potential transformer - Potential Transformers (PTs) - Secondary resonances - Simulating experiments - Simulation circuits - Zero sequence voltage","701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 931.1 Mechanics",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results show that the uncalibrated coaxial transmission reflection method can be used to measure and analyse the dielectric properties of high frequency bands of powder materials. Dielectric constant ( ′) and Dielectric loss factor ( '') of agricultural by-products at room temperature have a relationship between microwave frequency and moisture content.

The ARM9 is used as the control core of the system. The application software is a kind of Windows visualization program, developed in the environment of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. The system includes the carpool meter system, the display control system and the unlock tool. The carpool meter system can set different price parameters according to different regions, and it can charge preferentially for multiple passengers at the same time according to the parameters and the mileage pulse received per second, and prints the paper through the printer. The wireless inspection module identifies whether a taxi is a legitimate vehicle, and sends the traffic information to the relevant management. In the display control system interface can be handwritten to input the name of the destination. By pressing the button to select passenger information available in the car, then the LED display strip screen on the top of the taxi will display the passenger information. At the same time, it has the function of robbing the alarm to warn the outsider to help the driver to call the police. Also, unlock tool is designed for the carpool meter system. The preliminary application results show that the multi-window taximeter that meets the design requirements is very convenient.

Various methods based on different principles of technology have been used to deal with this issue. In recent years, the Web API ecosystem has accumulated a wealth of knowledge that can be used to enhance the recommendation models, and however, current concerns in this regard still remain. To cope with this issue, we present a graph-based algorithmic framework for the task of mashup-oriented API recommendation. Especially, we design a concise schema of the knowledge graph to encode the mashup-specific contexts and model the mashup requirement with graphic entities. We then exploit random walks with restart to assess the potential relevance between the mashup requirement and the Web APIs according to the knowledge graph. In addition, we propose the query-specific weighting strategies to enhance the knowledge graph construction. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is much superior to some state-of-the-art methods, also achieves robust effects on reducing computational overhead, and suppresses the negative Matthew effect in APIs' recommendation. © 2013 IEEE.","31","Economics","Graphic methods - Query processing - Random processes","Algorithmic framework - API recommendation - Computational overheads - Knowledge graphs - Mash-up - Random Walk - State-of-the-art methods - Weighting strategies","922.1 Probability Theory - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 2016M592721, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 61562090, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61562090, Grant 61472345, and Grant 61562092, and in part by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2016M592721.","Open Access","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The community researchers have designed many methods to automatically and accurately identify Android malware samples. However, the rapid increase of Android malicious samples outpowers the capabilities of traditional Android malware detectors and classifiers with respect to the cyber security risk management needs. It is important to identify the small proportion of Android malicious samples that may produce high cyber-security or privacy impact. In this paper, we propose a light-weight solution to automatically identify the Android malicious samples with high security and privacy impact. We manually check a number of Android malware families and corresponding security incidents and define two impact metrics for Android malicious samples. Our investigation results in a new Android malware dataset with impact ground truth (low impact or high impact). This new dataset is employed to empirically investigate the intrinsic characteristics of low-impact as well as high-impact malicious samples. To characterize and capture Android malicious samples' pattern, reverse engineering is performed to extract semantic features to represent malicious samples. The leveraged features are parsed from both the AndroidManifest.xml files as well as the disassembled binary classes.dex codes. Then, the extracted features are embedded into numerical vectors. Furthermore, we train highly accurate support vector machine and deep neural network classifiers to categorize the candidate Android malicious samples into low impact or high impact. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of our designed light-weight solution. This method can be further utilized for identifying those high-impact Android malicious samples in the wild. © 2013 IEEE.","50","Mobile security","Android (operating system) - Computer crime - Deep neural networks - Machine learning - Malware - Reverse engineering - Risk management - Semantics - Static analysis - Support vector machines","Android malware - High impact - Highly accurate - Intrinsic characteristics - Low impacts - Neural network classifier - Security incident - Semantic features","723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Test results show that the new process is very effective. Sodium sulfide was used as a vulcanizing agent in the flotation process, and butyl xanthate was used as a collector to obtain a qualified copper concentrate with a copper grade of 29.37% and a recovery rate of 32.22%. The flotation tailings were subjected to high-gradient magnetic separation to obtain magnetic concentrates and magnetic tailings, and copper was recovered by leaching from the magnetic concentrates and tailings. After secondary grinding of the magnetic concentrates, the leaching rates of copper from the magnetic concentrates and magnetic tailings were 26.85% and 26.95%, respectively. The total copper recovery was 86.02%. The new process introduces high-gradient magnetic separation, enriches refractory chrysocolla, leaches chrysocolla at 65 °C, leaches malachite from the magnetic tailings at 40 °C, and saves heating costs.

TEM images demonstrate that ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles are spherical in shape (9 ± 2 nm) and ZnFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposite exhibits spherical-like morphology (11 ± 3 nm).

A specific situation is thin poly-Si layer in tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) structure in high-efficiency solar cells. In this paper, we present a systematic study using a wide range UV-Raman spectroscopy to measure the crystalline structure and chemical bonding configurations in the TOPCon structure. Because of the high absorption coefficient of 325-nm laser in silicon films, the Raman probes only the top surface region and minimizes the contribution from c-Si substrate. However, the comparison with the Raman spectra collected with a green laser of 532 nm, the UV-Raman spectrum of a-Si:H shows a very different spectral shape with the disappearance of the LA mode of Si-Si vibration and an appearance of additional signal at 325 cm−1. In addition, the UV-Raman spectrum of the pre-crystallized P doped a-Si:H layer shows most of the vibration modes of Si–Si, Si–H, Si–O–Si and Si–O–H bonds, where the Si–O–H bonds are in the top surface oxide layer. After the crystallization, the Si-Si TO mode shows a high degree of crystallization, the Si-H vibration modes disappear, and an additional Si-O-Si mode is observed which is believed from the ultrathin SiOx passivation layer. In addition, we provide a set of UV-Raman measurements on the samples made with the same layer structure but at different annealing temperatures to show the correlation between the UV-Raman spectra and the passivation quality of the TOPCon structure on the n-type c-Si wafers. These observations prove that UV-Raman spectroscopy is a useful characterization tool for high efficiency c-Si solar cells with TOPCon structure. In addition, the impacts of the material properties on the passivation quality are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","33","Silicon solar cells","Chemical bonds - Crystallography - Efficiency - Film thickness - Passivation - Raman scattering - Raman spectroscopy - Silicon compounds - Silicon oxides - Silicon wafers - Solar cells - Substrates - Thin films - Ultraviolet spectroscopy","Absorption co-efficient - C-Si solar cell - Chemical bonding configuration - Degree of crystallization - High-efficiency solar cells - Thin film silicon - TOPCon - Ultrathin silicon oxide","539.2.1 Protection Methods - 702.3 Solar Cells - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 913.1 Production Engineering - 933.1 Crystalline Solids","Number: 2016B10004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016YFB0700202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: LR16F040002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province; Number: 2014B10026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017A610020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo; Number: 2015D10021, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: ZJUAMIS1704, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61874177, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61574145, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51502315, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61704176, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB0700202 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61574145 , 51502315 , 61704176 , 61874177 ), Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. LR16F040002 ), Major Project and Key S&T Program of Ningbo ( 2016B10004 ), Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo City ( 2017A610020 ), International S&T Cooperation Program of Ningbo ( 2015D10021 ), the Key S&T Research Program of Ningbo ( 2014B10026 ), Open project of Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Advanced Microelectronic Intelligent Systems and Applications (Grant ZJUAMIS1704 ).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We developed four candidate models to simulate nutrients-Chla relationship. Model selection results showed the relationship has changed and only one change point exists. Further research based on the selected model showed that (1) the change point was around the 96th observation, (2) nutrients increase did not drive the relationship change, (3) total phosphorus (TP) plays a more important role than total nitrogen on Chla increase, and (4) nutrients reduction is a better strategy than ecosystem recovery to effectively reduce Chla concentration. Therefore, TP reduction should have the priority in Yilong Lake. BCPM is convenient for model selection, posterior distribution acquisition, and relationship change quantification.

The present study is a report of biosynthesizing AgNPs using Chlorophytum borivilianum L. (Safed musli) callus extract as a novel source of reducing agent. AgNO3 solution challenged with the methanolic callus extract displayed a change in color from yellow to brown owing to the bioreduction reaction. Further, AgNPs were characterized by using UV-visible spectrophotometry, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). UV-vis spectrum revealed the surface plasmon resonance property of AgNPs at around 450 nm. XRD pattern with typical peaks indicated the face-centered cubic nature of silver. AFM analysis confirmed the existence of spherical-shaped and well-dispersed AgNPs having an average size of 52.0 nm. Further, FTIR analysis confirmed the involvement of different phytoconstituents of the callus extract role in the process of bioreduction to form nanoparticles. The AgNPs were more efficient in inhibiting the tested pathogenic microbes, namely, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Methicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans compared to callus extract. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay confirmed the cytotoxic property of AgNPs against human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29) in a dose-dependent manner. At higher concentrations of 500 μg/mL AgNPs, the cell viability was observed to be only 7% after 24 hours with IC50 value of 254 μg/mL.

Here, we determined the lipidomic profile of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) using ultraperformance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). Using a nontargeted approach, we detected approximately 3000 species. Analysis of the lipid metabolic profiles at young adult and ten-day-old ages among wild-type N2, glp-1 defective mutant, and double mutant daf- 16;glp-1 uncovered significant age-related differences in the total amount of phosphatidylcholines (PC), sphingomyelins (SM), ceramides (Cer), diglycerides (DG), and triglycerides (TG). In addition, the age-associated lipid profiles were characterized by ratio of polyunsaturated (PUFA) over monounsaturated (MUFA) lipid species. Lipid metabolism modulation plays an important role in reproduction-regulated aging; to identify the variations of lipid metabolites during germ line loss-induced longevity, we investigated the lipidomic profiles of long-lived glp-1/notch receptor mutants, which have reproductive deficiency when grown at nonpermissive temperature. The results showed that there was some age-related lipid variation, including TG 40:2, TG 40:1, and TG 41:1, which contributed to the long-life phenotype. The longevity of glp-1 mutant was daf-16-dependent; the lipidome analysis of daf-16;glp-1 double mutant revealed that the changes of some metabolites in the glp-1 mutant were daf- 16-dependent, while other metabolites displayed more complex epistatic patterns.

The source regions for the regional Zn-Pb mineralization in the SYG are still controversial, mostly in regard to the Emeishan flood basalts, basement rocks and host rocks. The Maozu Zn-Pb deposit is geographically close to the SYG center, which could also indicate that it is closer to the regional Zn-bearing fluid center than those deposits along the SYG margin. However, the origin of the ore-forming Zn in the Maozu deposit has not been constrained until now. In this study, the Zn and S isotopic compositions and Fe and Cd concentrations of the sphalerite from the Maozu deposit are investigated to evaluate the Zn isotopic fractionation during sphalerite precipitation, the source regions of the ore-forming zinc and sulfur, and the center of the regional Zn-bearing fluid system. It is suggested that the Zn isotopic fractionation between the sphalerite and original fluid during sphalerite precipitation could be limited due to the striking decrease in the temperature of the incoming fluid. The Zn isotopic variation of the sphalerite from four mining levels in the Maozu deposit is really small (−0.06 to +0.23‰), which could be attributed to heterogeneous Zn isotopic compositions in original incoming fluid rather than Zn isotopic fractionation during sphalerite deposition. As such, in the Maozu deposit, the Zn isotopic compositions of original hydrothermal fluid could approximately be represented by the Zn isotopic signals documented in sphalerite (−0.06 to +0.23‰). We found that the Zn isotopic signatures of incoming fluid are largely overlapped with those of the basement rocks (+0.10 to +0.34‰), signifying that the ore-forming Zn could be predominantly sourced from the basement rocks. However, in the Maozu deposit, the ore-forming sulfur is most likely derived from the sulfur-bearing evaporates hosted in the country rocks via thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR). The contrasting sources of ore-forming zinc and sulfur suggest the mixing of Zn-bearing fluid from the basement rocks and sulfur-bearing fluid from the host rocks, which could be responsible for the sharp decrease in the temperature of the incoming fluid in the Maozu deposit. Combined with the results of previous studies, the integrally lower Zn isotopic compositions of sphalerite in the Maozu deposit compared to those deposits along the SYG margin may demonstrate that the Maozu deposit is closer to the regional Zn-bearing fluid center. If this is the case, Zn isotopes could be an effective proxy to trace the Zn source of Zn-enriched ore deposits and to identify the regional Zn-bearing fluid center of Zn-enriched metallogenic provinces. © 2019","58","Zinc","Basalt - Binary alloys - Deposits - Economic geology - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Lead zinc deposits - Mixing - Ore reduction - Ores - Silver deposits - Sulfur compounds - Zinc sulfide","Fluid mixing - Guizhou - Isotopic composition - Isotopic fractionations - Isotopic signatures - Isotopic variations - S isotopes - Thermochemical sulfate reduction","481.1 Geology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds","Number: 2014CB440906, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41430315, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41573011, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1812402, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: XDB18030302, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: YIPA, Sponsor: Youth Innovation Promotion Association; ","This project was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0602503), the Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB18030302), the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB440906), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1812402, 41430315, 41573011), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS.

Insufficient local observations can increase parameter uncertainty, leading to modeling outputs of limited credibility. This paper proposes an event-based multiple pattern inverse modeling approach to estimate regional-scale parameters characterizing the buildup and washoff processes in urban watersheds. The approach explicitly accounts for system uncertainties by simultaneously using a wide range of storm events. A genetic algorithm was employed to solve the inverse models. The solution populations that minimize the error between the observed and predicted values were then filtered into distinct parameter groups using a K-means clustering algorithm. Each identified parameter group may be used to represent the buildup and washoff processes. The proposed approach was applied for the New England region (United States) using two study sites with impervious land cover: Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Stormwater monitoring data of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in small to medium size rainfall events were used to identify representative parameter sets for the region. Of the 21 identified candidate parameter combinations, 13 were found to have acceptable Root Mean Square Error for both TN and TP. The 13 parameter sets were grouped into four distinct patterns to represent different potential buildup and washoff mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the approach is capable of estimating robust sets of buildup and washoff parameters at a regional scale.

The effect of Sr doping (x) on crystal structure, surface morphology, magnetic, and electrical transport properties of LSMO ceramics were investigated systematically. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that all samples crystallized in single phases with rhombohedral structure (R3 ¯ c space group), without any detectable impurity phases. With the increase of x content, lattice parameters expanded, whereas grain size of LSMO ceramic enlarged and grain boundaries (GBs) decreased accordingly. For LSMO ceramics with x = 0.16, peak value of temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) reached 2.7% K−1 as the peak-TCR temperature (TK) approached room temperature at 292.5 K, as well as the maximum magnetoresistance (MR) value arrived 17.9% at 300.2 K. In addition, peak TCR of LSMO (x= 0.2) was obtained at 6.4% K−1 as TK at 329.4 K. These properties of modulation TCR and MR at room temperature in LSMO ceramics were interpreted by the interaction of double exchange mechanism and Jahn-Teller effects.

The IoV users can offload their computing tasks to the edge computing devices (ECDs) for low latency execution and the cloud can be engaged to process big data with sufficient computing resources. Though galactic convenience brought by the IoV cloud-edge computing system, it remains a challenge to manage the resource of ECDs by reducing the energy and time consumption while avoiding the situation of overload or underload of the ECDs to maintain the system-stability. Moreover, during the movement of the vehicles, the computing tasks and data may be uploaded to different ECDs and the data continuity may be destroyed. In this paper, a multi-objective computation offloading method (MOC) for IoV in cloud-edge computing is proposed to deal with the challenges above. A vehicle-to-vehicle communication-based route obtaining algorithm is designed first. Then, in order to ensure the trustworth of the IoV data, which ECD to upload the computing tasks to is selected. Under the case that all ECDs are overloaded, the computation offloading between ECDs and cloud is considered. In addition, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III is adopted to realize the multi-objective optimization of decreasing the load balancing rate and reduce the energy consumption in ECDs and shorten the time during processing the computing tasks. Furthermore, we employ the simple additive weighting and multiple criteria decision making to evaluate the solutions of our proposed method. Finally, experimental evaluations are conducted to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","48","Vehicle to vehicle communications","Decision making - Edge computing - Electrochromic devices - Energy utilization - Genetic algorithms - Green computing - Motor transportation - Multiobjective optimization - System stability - Vehicles","Computation offloading - Data trustworthy - Experimental evaluation - Multiple criteria decision making - Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms - NSGA-III - Real-time traffic information - Simple additive weighting","525.3 Energy Utilization - 714 Electronic Components and Tubes - 716 Telecommunication; Radar, Radio and Television - 912.2 Management - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 961 Systems Science",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

As a consequence, the mining semantic information contained in the video itself is a more feasible way. In this paper, we propose an action parsing-driven video summarization model based on reinforcement learning. The model is mainly divided into two parts, video cut by action parsing and video summarization based on reinforcement learning. In the first part, a sequential multiple instance learning model is trained with weakly annotated data to solve the problem of full annotation's time consuming and weak annotation's ambiguity. In the second part, we design a deep recurrent neural network-based video summarization model that selects the most distinguishable frames comparing with other actions. Meanwhile, the quality of the extracted key frames could be evaluated by the categorization accuracy.

Mapping of the spatiotemporal variations of ground deformation is urgently needed, along with summarization of the causes of the subsidence over Kunming with the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, for the first time, a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique with L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-1) and X-band Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) data was applied to Kunming to derive the time series deformation from 2007 to 2016. The annual deformation velocity revealed two severe subsiding regions in Kunming, with a maximum subsidence of 35 mm/y. The comparison of the deformation between InSAR and leveling showed root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of about 4.5 mm for the L-band and 3.7 mm for the X-band, indicating that our results were reliable. We also found that the L-band illustrated a larger amount of subsidence than the X-band in the tested regions. This difference was mainly caused by the different synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-acquired times and imaging geometries between the L-and X-band SAR images. The vertical time series deformation over two severe subsiding regions presented an approximate linear variation with time, where the cumulative subsidence reached 209 mm during the period of 2007–2016. In view of relevant analyses, we found that the subsidence in Kunming was the result of soft soil consolidation, building load, and groundwater extraction.

MEM has been tested on two fraud related datasets to compare with three state-of-the-art classifiers: neural network, naive Bayes and logistic regression. The experimental results show that MEM performs better than the other three classifiers in both datasets under the four measures: accuracy, recall, F-value and kappa.

However, because of the sensitivity limit of TIMS, it is still not possible to obtain high precision 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios for picogram-level sample sizes (30-100 pg) due to the lack of a highly sensitive emitter. This study is the first to employ a highly sensitive silicotungstic acid emitter to measure Sr isotopes at the picogram-level using TIMS. This emitter produces a 3-fold enhancement in the ionization efficiency of Sr and not only significantly reduces the required sample size but also has good external precision. Analyses of the NIST 987 standard yield an external reproducibility (2 RSD, n = 8) better than ±0.013% even for 30 pg of Sr. It is possible to yield an internal precision (2 RSE) of ±0.003% for 100 pg of sample using the default 1011 Ohm feedback resistors. This method was verified by using a suite of silicate reference materials. Replicate digestions and analyses (n = 8) of the basalt standard BCR-2 (87Sr/86Sr = 0.704998 ± 0.000028, 2 SD) at the 326 ± 30 pg level demonstrates that good external reproducibility is reached on ultratrace level silicate samples.

By adopting Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II with the feasible solution, we obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions to minimize both energy consumption and makespan. Finally, we perform experiments on several real workloads to evaluate the solutions produced by our proposed algorithm and analyze the trade-off relationship between energy and makespan. The results show that the Pareto optimal solutions are close to the lower bound obtained by the relaxation of the integer linear bi-objective optimization model and can also assist system manager to make intelligent resource allocation decisions for Mapreduce applications based on the energy efficiency and performance needs of the system. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","22","Green computing","Artificial intelligence - Economic and social effects - Energy efficiency - Energy utilization - Genetic algorithms - Integer programming - Optimal systems - Pareto principle - Resource allocation","Bi-objective optimization - Efficiency and performance - Makespan - Map-reduce - Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii - NSGA-II - Pareto optimal solutions - Resource allocation problem","525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 912.2 Management - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 961 Systems Science - 971 Social Sciences","Number: 61662088, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61762091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61762091, 61662088), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province of China (No. 2017ZZX228), Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University, and Training Program of National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The results showed that compared to the soils aged only for 2 and 21 d, the concentrations inhibiting 50% reproduction (EC50) significantly increased by 2.8–5.2 fold and 1.7–2.6 fold, the concentrations causing 50% mortality (LC50) were higher than the highest test concentration in four soils aged for 150 d. Furthermore, the aging effects correlated significantly with soil amorphous Fe oxides. The EC50 values of Cr significantly differed in ten soils aged for 150 d, ranging from 27 to 512 mg kg−1, which were associated with the variations in reduction and sorption capacity in different soils. Regression analysis indicated that soil clay was the most important single factor predicting soil Cr toxicity to reproduction, and the inclusion of cation exchange capacity in the clay regression could best explain the toxicity variance (87.2%).

The purpose of this study was to check concentration level of arsenic in Boletus edulis, Tricholoma matsutake and Suillellus luridus, estimate arsenic bioaccessibility and find out which arsenic species occur in mushrooms to assess if they may pose a threat to human health. An analytical methodology based on ion chromatography (IC) hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with dynamic reaction cell (DRC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with UV–Vis detection and ICP-DRC-MS detection. Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE), microwave assisted extraction (MAE) and enzymatic assisted extraction (EAE) were applied. Quantification of As species in extracts was performed by IC/ICP-DRC-MS in the first dimension. Slightly better extraction efficiencies were obtained for MAE (from 75% to 90%) then for UAE. EAE was used for estimation of bioaccessibility by application of a modified BARGE bioaccessibility method (UBM) for in vitro studies. Bioaccessibility values were in the ranges of 73%–102%, 74%–115% and 18%–87% for step 1 (S1), for step 2 (S2) and for step 3 (S3) of EAE, respectively. Extracts obtained after EAE were subjected to SEC-UV-Vis/ICP-DRC-MS analysis as the second dimension. The main signal was obtained in the area of a molecular mass of ∼5 kDa for all mushroom extracts.

Currently, based on contrasting interpretations of their origin, two competing reconstruction models, the internal model and the external model, have been formulated to constrain the paleogeographic position of the South China block in Rodinia. In this study, we examined 17 representative samples from three intrusions (Kuchahe, Leidashu, and Qizanmi) within the Ailao Shan-Red River belt, located in the southwestern Yangtze block. Laser-ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating suggests that they were emplaced during the mid-Neoproterozoic (ca. 750 Ma). The Kuchahe and Leidashu intrusions share geochemical characteristics of S-type and A2-type rocks, respectively. Elemental and isotopic data suggest that the Kuchahe intrusion was derived by biotite-dehydration melting of a metapelitic source, whereas the Leidashu intrusion was produced by partial melting of earlier Neoproterozoic granodiorites in the middle crust (~15 km), with mixing of basaltic magmas. The Qizanmi intrusion is composed of hornblende gabbro and was likely derived by partial melting of a shallow and enriched lithospheric mantle source modified by slab-released fluids, with accumulation of plagioclase and fractionation of mafic minerals. The three intrusions were emplaced in a back-arc setting, in response to the roll-back of a subducted slab rather than mantle plume activity. The mid-Neoproterozoic (ca. 750 Ma) subduction process argues against the South China block occupying an internal setting in Rodinia, which was finally assembled before 0.9 Ga. © 2019 The Authors.","113","Geochemistry","Feldspar - Geochronology - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry - Laser ablation - Lead alloys - Melting - Mica - Silicate minerals - Zircon","Geochemical characteristic - Hornblende gabbro - Internal modeling - Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometries (LA ICP MS) - Lithospheric mantle - Representative sample - Subduction process - Zircon U-Pb dating","481 Geology and Geophysics - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations","Number: 41703022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 41703022), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (lzujbky-2018-52), the Plateau Mountain Ecology and Earth's Environment Discipline Construction Project (grants C176240107), and the Joint Foundation Project between Yunnan Science and Technology Department and Yunnan University (grants C176240210019).

However, the parameter distribution that affects system reliability often lacks strict regularity in engineering. Even the parameters generally obey a certain distribution, they always drift. Information-loss is another concern when traditional methods are used to deal with such uncertainties. Therefore, a new method to conduct system reliability analysis under uncertain information is proposed by introducing probability-box theory. Firstly, the probability-box is used to model uncertain parameters. Secondly, the probability-box model of system reliability is obtained by discretizing each parameter into equally confidence levels and calculating Cartesian product with the system reliability equation. Finally, the risk zone and the stable zone are divided with zero as boundary, and the system reliability is quantitatively analyzed by integral calculating the area of probability-box. The cantilever beam system is analyzed in the experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, and can also improve the accuracy compared with other related approaches. © 2019, Science Press.

Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to collect images with very fine spatial and temporal resolutions. However, acquired image pairs of the same scene often contain scale changes, noises and rotated changes at different temporal scales. To address these problems, we propose a small UAV-based multi-temporal change detection for cultivated land cover in mountainous terrain which contains the following contributions. First, the multi-scale feature description includes convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature descriptor (CFD) and neighbouring structure descriptor (NSD), where CFD is generated using layers formed via a pretrained Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16 architecture. Second, a gradually increasing selection of inliers is defined for improving the robustness of feature point registration. Finally, intuitionistic fuzzy C-Means (IFCM) classifier is adopted to generate a similarity matrix between image pair of geometric correction process. The performance of proposed method is validated on multi-temporal image pairs taken by the small UAV. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect cultivated land cover change at small size and scattered distribution landscapes, obtain satisfactory change detection results. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","15","Aircraft detection","Antennas - Fuzzy sets - Image registration - Land use - Landforms - Neural networks - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Change detection - Convolutional neural network - Cultivated lands - Geometric correction - Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means - Multi-temporal - Small UAV - Spatial and temporal resolutions","403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 481.1 Geology - 652.1 Aircraft, General - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing","Number: 41661080, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work were supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No: 41661080] and Yunnan Ten-thousand Talents Program.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, the conventional frequency response curve obtained from the time domain transient response only contains the frequency domain information of signal, and the time domain information is neglected. Furthermore, the traditional approach of using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in processing the non-stationary signal could result in lack of useful information. This paper proposes a novel winding deformation fault diagnostic technique which is modified from IFRA, the detected transient signals of pulse response are processed based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) algorithm, and the wavelet time-frequency diagram are plotted and analyzed. The simulation of a simple transformer high frequency model and experiment analysis show that the various types of winding deformation can be distinguished by the proposed technique. The data processing result by the wavelet transform conforms with the variation pattern of frequency response to different winding fault types. Besides, the verification result of experiment indicates that the wavelet time-frequency diagram obtained by the proposed technique shows better performance than the frequency response curves obtained by the conventional FFT on processing the transient signals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","24","Wavelet transforms","Data handling - Deformation - Failure analysis - Fast Fourier transforms - Fault detection - Frequency response - Measurement - Power transformers - Time domain analysis - Transformer windings - Transient analysis - Winding","Continuous Wavelet Transform - Continuous wavelet transforms - Frequency response analysis - Frequency-response curves - High-frequency modeling - Transformer - Transformer winding deformations - Winding deformations","691.2 Materials Handling Methods - 704.1 Electric Components - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations","Number: 51807166, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: SWU118031, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51807166 and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant SWU118031.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Identity loss and attribute loss can provide complementary information on a different perspective by integrating multi-context information. Identity focuses on the overall contour and appearance, while attribute focuses on local aspects and dresses of one person. Identification loss and verification loss are used to optimize the distance of samples. Identification loss used to construct a robust category space, while verification loss used to optimize the space by minimizing the distance between similar images, and maximizing the distance between dissimilar images. Moreover, an effective verification loss named constraint contrast verification (CCV) is proposed to restrict the distance between feature pair to a foreseeable range that ensures the network has better convergence.

However, interactions between AgNPs and proteins are poorly understood. Two dehydrogenases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), are chosen to investigate these interactions. Ag bound to thiol groups of these enzymes significantly decreases the number of free thiols available. Dose-dependent inhibition of enzyme activities is observed in both AgNPs and Ag+ treatments. Based on the concentration required to inhibit 50% activity, GAPDH and MDH are 24–30 fold more sensitive to Ag+ than to AgNPs suggesting that the measured 4.2% Ag+ containing AgNPs can be responsible for the enzymes inhibition. GAPDH, with a thiol group in its active site, is more sensitive to Ag than MDH, displaying many thiol groups but none in its active site, suggesting that thiol groups at the active site strongly determines the sensitivity of enzymes toward AgNPs. In contrast, the dramatic changes of circular dichroism spectra show that the global secondary structure of MDH under AgNPs treatment is more altered than that of GAPDH. In summary, this study shows that the thiol groups and their location on these dehydrogenases are crucial for the AgNPs effects. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The shortage of freshwater has been identified as a crucial issue all around the world. Solar desalination is one of the options to produce fresh water from any type of contaminated water (brackish, contaminated and sea water) in a sustainable way. A solar still is a simple device used to purify the water using solar energy through evaporation and condensation processes. In general, the productivity of the conventional solar still (CSS) is about 2–5 l/m2/day. But this quantity is not sufficient for an individual to lead an adequate life. Hence either more than 1 m2 is required per person or better yet are modifications to improve the yield of the fresh water (likely more than 5 l/m2/day). In this work, an attempt has been made to categorize the different solar still designs with productivity exclusively more than 5 l/m2/day. Here, we identify as such efficient high productivity stills and discuss their novel modifications and heat transfer mechanism to arrive at useful conclusions.

LMWLs have practical utility as a hydrologic framework and as benchmarks for evaluating hydroclimatic processes in isotope-enabled climate models. In this manuscript, we characterize the global distribution of LMWLs and compare them to LMWLs from model data. To evaluate the sensitivity of the covariance of stable isotope ratios to data set length, we paired time series rarifaction with Bayesian ellipse estimation. We then applied a threshold of 48 months and estimated LMWLs at 398 sites in 25 Köppen climate classes using orthogonal distance regression. Slopes ranged from 4.8 to 10.9, with an average of 7.64 ± 0.64. Intercepts ranged from −24‰ to 27‰, with an average of 6.85 ± 6.2‰. We identified three processes: (1) subcloud evaporation of rain, (2) atmospheric remoistening by rainfall evaporation, and (3) conditions of snow formation as important controls on slopes and intercepts in arid, humid, and seasonally snowy regions, respectively. We compared observational LMWLs with those from a suite of isotope-enabled climate models. At arid and snowy sites, model data produced higher slopes and intercepts than observational data. At humid sites, model data exhibited dampened variability in slopes and intercepts relative to observational data. These results indicate potential for improvement in the precipitation and/or isotope parameterizations of raindrop evaporation, advection of reevaporated water, evapotranspiration fractionation, and supersaturation in mixed-phase clouds. This meta-analysis demonstrates LMWLs utility for identifying specific hydroclimatic and isotopic processes in observations and models. © 2019. American Geophysical Union.

This paper comprehensively considers the factors of recent available time, criticality and execution time, and then proposes a fuzzy scheduling algorithm of high priority random tasks (FSA-HPRT) for CPS. The algorithm first obtains the applicable time slice by maximizing delayed the execution time of the periodic task, and calculates the difference between the end time of the periodic task and the deadline time as the error time slice. Then use the fuzzy set to process the latest available time, criticality and execution time of the random task to decide the random task priority. Finally, the task-scheduling queue is established for the system to perform scheduling according to the priority of the random task by using the applicable time slice and the error time slice. The simulation results show that compared with the ISS algorithm, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the submission rate of important random tasks. At the same time, high-priority random tasks can get responses preferentially. © 2019 IEEE.","11",,,,,"Number: 61562051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 61562051.",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Genes from different gene families or genes with redundant functions in the same gene family can be examined by assembling multiple CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) in a single vector. However, the activity and efficiency of CRISPR/Cas12a in the non-vascular plant Physcomitrella patens are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that LbCas12a together with its mature crRNA can target multiple loci simultaneously in P. patens with high efficiency via co-delivery of LbCas12a and a crRNA expression cassette in vivo. The mutation frequencies induced by CRISPR/LbCas12a at a single locus ranged from 26.5 to 100%, with diverse deletions being the most common type of mutation. Our method expands the repertoire of genome editing tools available for P. patens and facilitates the creation of loss-of-function mutants of multiple genes from different gene families. © 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","60","Genes","Efficiency","CRISPR/Cas12a - CRISPR/Cas9 - Expression cassette - High-efficiency - Loss-of-function mutants - Mutation frequency - Physcomitrella patens - Technical advances","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 913.1 Production Engineering",,,,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The crystallinity of the GeSn layer was investigated via high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) and the strain relaxation degree of the GeSn layer was evaluated to be approximately 50%. A novel method was also proposed to evaluate the averaged threading dislocation densities (TDDs) in the GeSn layer, which was obtained from the rocking curve of GeSn layer along the (004) plane. The photoluminescence (PL) measurement result shows the significant optical emission (1870 nm) from the deposited high-quality GeSn layer. To verify whether our deposited GeSn can be used for optoelectronic devices, we fabricated the simple vertical p-i-n diode, and the room temperature current-voltage (I-V) characteristic was obtained.

Although an alternative ranking is available, specific portfolio and optimal investment ratios cannot be obtained by using the qualitative decision-making methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hesitant fuzzy linguistic portfolio model based on the max-score rule and the hesitant fuzzy linguistic element with variable risk appetite (HFLE-RA). The HFLE-RA is able to express qualitative evaluation information by using the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set and describe the variable investor risk appetites by introducing the asymmetric sigmoid semantics. Thus, different investors can be distinguished by the risk appetite parameters according to the asymmetric sigmoid semantics, and the optimal investment ratios can be obtained by applying the proposed portfolio model. Moreover, the investment opportunities and efficient frontiers of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic portfolio model are investigated. Also, a value-at-risk fitting approach is introduced to calculate the risk appetite parameters. Based on these works, a qualitative investment ratio calculation process is provided in the HFLE-RA environment. Lastly, a real example of calculating the optimal investment ratios for four newly listed stocks in the Growth Enterprises Market board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange is provided to demonstrate the proposed approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","51","Investments","Decision making - Electronic trading - Financial markets - Semantics - Value engineering","Financial decisions - Fuzzy linguistics - Investment opportunities - Investment ratios - Portfolio model - Qualitative decision making - Qualitative evaluations - Shenzhen stock exchanges","723.5 Computer Applications - 911.5 Value Engineering - 912.2 Management","Number: 71561026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71571123, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71840001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71561026, 71571123 and 71840001) and Applied Basic Research Programs of Science and Technology Commission of Yunnan Province under Grant (No. 2017FB102).",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"
