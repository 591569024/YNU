Biotechnol. Biotechnol. Equip.,"Domestic guinea pig is a model animal for human disease research. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) is an important human disease-related gene. In this study, the complete coding sequence of domestic guinea pig gene UGT1A1 was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The open reading frame of the domestic guinea pig UGT1A1 gene is 1602 bp in length and was found to encode a protein of 533 amino acids. Sequence analysis revealed that the UGT1A1 protein of domestic guinea pig shared high homology with the UGT1A1 proteins of degu (84%), damara mole-rat (84%), human (80%), northern white-cheeked gibbon (80%), Colobus angolensis palliatus (80%) and golden snub-nosed monkey (79%). This gene contains five exons and four introns, as revealed by the computer- assisted analysis. The results also showed that the domestic guinea pig UGT1A1 gene had a close genetic relationship with the UGT1A1 gene of degu. The prediction of transmembrane helices showed that domestic guinea pig UGT1A1 might be a transmembrane protein. Expression profile analysis indicated that the domestic guinea pig UGT1A1 gene was differentially expressed in detected domestic guinea pig tissues. Our experiment laid a primary foundation for using the domestic guinea pig as a model animal to study the UGT1A1-related human diseases. © 2015 The Author(s).

RSC Adv.,"CaO-Al2O3-SiO2(CAS) glass-ceramics were prepared by a melting method using different amounts of natural cooling yellow phosphorus slag as the main material, and afterwards the effects of the slag on the crystallization and properties of glass-ceramics were studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystallization activation energy E of the glass-ceramic samples was calculated by modified Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) and Ozawa methods, and Avrami indices n of the samples were analyzed with Augis-Bennett equations. The results showed that the crystallization behavior of glass ceramics was surely affected with the addition of different amounts of slag. The crystallization activation energy calculated with the modified Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) equation ranged from 200.8678 kJ mol-1(Slag-1) to 380.0184 kJ mol-1(Slag-3) and from 220.7858 kJ mol-1(Slag-1) to 400.6569 kJ mol-1(Slag-3) by the Ozawa method. The crystallization indices increased from 3.20 (Slag-1) to 4.07 (Slag-3). The main crystalline phases were gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7) and akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) in Slag-1 and Slag-2, while anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) and akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) were the main crystalline phases in Slag-3. The structure of the grains in the samples changed from spherical to columnar. The Slag-3 sample showed stronger acid resistance, alkali resistance and lower water absorption than Slag-1 and Slag-2. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20163802820953,,"Liu, Hong-Pan (1); Ma, Li-Ping (1); Huang, Xiao-Feng (1); Tang, Jian-Xiao (1); Yang, Jie (1); Yang, Jing (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",RSCACL,482.2 Minerals - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Acid resistance - Activation energy - Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Crystalline materials - Crystallization - Differential thermal analysis - Feldspar - Glass ceramics - Magnesium compounds - Phosphorus - Scanning electron microscopy - Silica - Water absorption - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ma, Li-Ping(lpma2522@hotmail.com) ",10.1039/c6ra07854k,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,90,2016,English,Slags,,24.0,87696-87702,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Effect of different amounts of slag on the crystallization behavior of glass-ceramics produced by natural cooling yellow phosphorus slag,,Crystalline phasis - Crystallization activation energy - Crystallization behavior - Crystallization index - Differential thermal analyses (DTA) - Johnson Mehl Avrami equation - Johnson-mehl-avrami - Yellow phosphorus,6
J. Mater. Chem. C,"Here, CuO micro-sheets were successfully synthesized from Cu foil using the annealing procedure. Cupric oxalate (CuC2O4·xH2O) micro-sheets were firstly peeled off by immersing Cu foil in oxalic acid solution at room temperature, and then they were converted into CuO with preserved configuration after thermal treatment at 350 °C. Various techniques were employed for the characterization of the structure and morphology of as-prepared products. Results revealed that the samples were composed of a large amount of porous CuO micro-sheets, which were constructed by plenty of nano-sized primary particles. A gas sensor was fabricated using as-prepared CuO micro-sheets and was systematically investigated for its ability to detect n-butanol. Due to the porous structure of CuO micro-sheets, the sensor based on CuO micro-sheets manifests a remarkably improved sensing performance, including high response, good selectivity, excellent reproducibility and stability, and limit of detection as low as 10 ppm at 160 °C, suggesting its greatly promising applications in gas sensing. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,20160601895543,,"Dong, Chengjun (1, 2); Wang, Lihong (1); Chen, Gang (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 2); Djerdj, Igor (3); Wang, Yude (1, 2) ","(1) School of Physics Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Tecnhology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Ruer BoŠkovi Institute, Bijenika 54, Zagreb; 10000, Croatia ",JMCCCX,544.1 Copper - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,,,,,Copper oxides - Gas detectors - Metal cladding - Oxalic acid,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c5tc02821c,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20507526,,,,20507534,5,2016,English,Copper,,31.0,985-990,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,Journal of Materials Chemistry C,,Facile synthesis of CuO micro-sheets over Cu foil in oxalic acid solution and their sensing properties towards n-butanol,,Annealing procedures - Limit of detection - Oxalic acid solution - Porous structures - Primary particles - Reproducibilities - Sensing performance - Structure and morphology,4
Energy Build.,"A semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/poly(polyethylene glycol diacrylate) (PPGD) composites as novel form-stable PCMs was successfully prepared via in situ polymerization. The mass percentage of PEG reached 70 wt% without any leakage above the melting point of PEG. The prepared form-stable PCMs were investigated by scanning election microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarization optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG), respectively. SEM and FTIR results show that the PEG is uniformly dispersed into the PPGD network and there are only physical interactions between PEG and PPGD. POM images and XRD patterns reveal that the crystalline structure of PEG is not affected by PPGD network and the crystal size of PEG in form-stable PCMs decreases due to the restriction of PPGD network. DSC analysis results present that the melting and freezing temperatures and the latent heats of form-stable PCM were measured as 58.62 and 37.45 °C and 117.41 and 115.17 J/g, respectively. Thermal cycling test and TG analysis confirm that the prepared form-stable PCMs exhibit good thermal reliability and stability. The prepared form-stable PCMs have great potential application in the area of solar energy storage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Int. Arch. Photogramm., Remote Sens. Spat. Inf. Sci. - ISPRS Arch.","Recently, high resolution remote sensing image segmentation is a hot issue in image processing procedures. However, it is a difficult task. The difficulties derive from the uncertainties of pixel segmentation and decision-making model. To this end, we take spatial relationship into consideration when constructing the interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks for high resolution remote sensing image segmentation. First, the proposed algorithm constructs a Gaussian model as a type-1 fuzzy model to describe the uncertainty contained in the image. Second, the interval type-2 fuzzy model is obtained by blurring the mean and variance in type-1 model. The proposed interval type-2 model can strengthen the expression of uncertainty and simultaneously decrease the uncertainty in the decision model. Then the fuzzy membership function itself and its upper and lower fuzzy membership functions of the training samples are used as the input of the neuron network which acts as the decision model in the proposed algorithm. Finally, the relationship of neighbour pixels is taken into consideration and the fuzzy membership functions of the detected pixel and its neighbourhood are used to decide the class of each pixel to get the final segmentation result. The proposed algorithm, FCM and HMRF-FCM algorithm and an interval type-2 fuzzy neuron networks without spatial relationships are performed on synthetic and real high resolution remote sensing images. The qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate the efficient of the proposed algorithm, especially for homogeneous regions which contains a great difference in its gray level (for example forest).",Open Access,20163102657164,,"Wang, Chunyan (1); Xu, Aigong (2); Li, Chao (3); Zhao, Xuemei (2) ","(1) School of Mining Industry and Technology, Liaoning Technical University, Huludao; 125105, China (2) School of Geomatics, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin; 123000, China (3) Yunnan Technology Center of Basic Surveying and Mapping, Yunnan; 650034, China ",,"461.9 Biology - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 912.2 Management - 921 Mathematics",122460.0,"July 12, 2016 - July 19, 2016","Prague, Czech republic","23rd International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences Congress, ISPRS 2016",Decision making - Fuzzy inference - Fuzzy logic - Fuzzy neural networks - Image segmentation - Membership functions - Neurons - Pixels,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B7-385-2016,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 20122121110007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41271435, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41301479, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (No. 20122121110007) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41271435; No. 41301479).,,16821750,,2016,English,Remote sensing,"23rd ISPRS Congress, Commission VII",17.0,385-391,1of1,2016,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",,Interval type-2 fuzzy based neural network for high resolution remote sensing image segmentation,,Expression of uncertainty - Footprint of uncertainties - Fuzzy membership function - High resolution remote sensing images - Interval type-2 fuzzy - Interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks - Neuron networks - Qualitative and quantitative analysis,41

IMPC - Int. Miner. Process. Congr.,"As sulfide zinc ore deposits become exhausted, nonsulfide zinc ore deposits become the other resource for zinc production. However, flotation for zinc recovery from nonsulfide deposits is much more difficult than the flotation of sphalerite from sulfide deposits and may become an option for zinc production only if a suitable processing technology is developed. In this regard, research efforts are being devoted to the flotation of nonsulfide zinc oxide minerals. Some common methods which have been used for the flotation of zinc oxide minerals include sulfidization-flotation, activation, and direct flotation with anionic and cationic collectors. The traditional flotation techniques have low efficiency and difficulty in separation and recovery of the zinc minerals from gangue minerals, for example, smithsonite (ZnCO3) from other carbonate gangue minerals and hemimorphite (Zn4Si2O7(OH)2·H2O) from silicate gangue minerals. In this study potassium lauryl phosphate was evaluated as a collector for the flotation of nonsulfide zinc minerals. Results from contact angle and microflotation experiments at pH 6–9 show that hemimorphite (Zn4Si2O7(OH)2·H2O) can be floated from quartz and that smithsonite (ZnCO3) can be floated from calcite. However, when dodecylamine, which is a common collector reported in literature for the flotation of nonsulfide zinc minerals, was used as collector, no significant difference between nonsulfide zinc minerals and gangue minerals was observed at any pH value. Initial evaluation suggests that potassium lauryl phosphate is effective at low concentration and may be a promising collector for zinc oxide mineral flotation. © 2016 TAPPI Press.

For. Sci.,"Pinus yunnanensis is the main species used for reforestation in Yunnan province, China. To manage the genetic resources of this economically and ecologically important species efficiently, greater knowledge of the distribution of its genetic diversity is needed. In this study, the genetic diversity of 20 natural populations representing most of the P. yunnanensis range was examined using seven simple sequence repeats. No loci showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Most genetic diversity was found within populations, and overall genetic differentiation was low (FST=0.045). There was no sign of isolation by distance. Clustering of populations using both neighbor joining pair groups and principal coordinates analysis based on Nei’s genetic distance showed the presence of two major clusters. This result was reinforced using the Bayesian software STRUCTURE, which identified two southern populations as clearly separate from the others. There were no signs of genetic erosion, but some populations should be a focus of conservation efforts because of their higher level of genetic diversity and the presence of private alleles. These results will inform conservation and management of P. yunnanensis and will guide future studies of population genetics and breeding programs. © 2016 Society of American Foresters.",,20160501885320,,"Xu, Yulan (1); Cai, Nianhui (1); Woeste, Keith (2); Kang, Xiangyang (3); He, Chengzhong (1); Li, Genqian (1); Chen, Shi (1); Duan, Anan (1) ","(1) Southwest Forestry University, Key Laboratory for Forest Genetic and Tree Improvement and Propagation, Universities of Yunnan Province, China (2) USDA Forest Service Hardwood Tree Improvement, Regeneration Center at Purdue University, West Lafayette; IN, United States (3) The State Engineering Laboratory for Tree Breeding, College of Biological Science and Biotechnology, Beijing Forestry University, China ",FOSCAD,454 Environmental Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering,,,,,DNA sequences - Reforestation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.5849/forsci.15-064,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19383738,,,,0015749X,1,"February 8, 2016",English,Biodiversity,,67.0,38-47,,2016,Society of American Foresters,Forest Science,,Genetic diversity and population structure of pinus yunnanensis by simple sequence repeat markers,,Genetic differentiation - Genetic diversity - Genetic structure - Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium - Micro satellite - Principal coordinates analysis - Simple sequence-repeat markers - Yunnan pine,62
Phys A Stat Mech Appl,"Complex network approach has become an effective way to describe interrelationships among large amounts of biological data, which is especially useful in finding core functions and global behavior of biological systems. Hypertension is a complex disease caused by many reasons including genetic, physiological, psychological and even social factors. In this paper, based on the information of biological pathways, we construct a network model of hypertension-related genes of the salt-sensitive rat to explore the interrelationship between genes. Statistical and topological characteristics show that the network has the small-world but not scale-free property, and exhibits a modular structure, revealing compact and complex connections among these genes. By the threshold of integrated centrality larger than 0.71, seven key hub genes are found: Jun, Rps6kb1, Cycs, Creb312, Cdk4, Actg1 and RT1-Da. These genes should play an important role in hypertension, suggesting that the treatment of hypertension should focus on the combination of drugs on multiple genes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20154601547550,,"Wang, Huan (1, 2); Hu, Jing-Bo (2, 3); Xu, Chuan-Yun (2); Zhang, De-Hai (4); Yan, Qian (5); Xu, Ming (2, 6); Cao, Ke-Fei (2); Zhang, Xu-Sheng (7, 8) ","(1) School of Computer Science and Technology, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji; Shaanxi; 721016, China (2) Center for Nonlinear Complex Systems, Department of Physics, School of Physics Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China (3) School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji; Shaanxi; 721016, China (4) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China (5) School of Physics and Electronic Science, Chuxiong Normal University, Chuxiong; Yunnan; 675000, China (6) School of Mathematical Sciences, Kaili University, Kaili; Guizhou; 556011, China (7) Modelling and Economics Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, London; NW9 5EQ, United Kingdom (8) Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London; W2 1PG, United Kingdom ",PHYADX,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Distributed computer systems - Genes - Structure (composition),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cao, Ke-Fei(kfcao163@163.com) ",10.1016/j.physa.2015.10.048,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: ZK14035, Acronym: BUAS, Sponsor: Baoji University of Arts And Sciences; Number: 15RKX-1-5-6, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guizhou Science and Technology Department; Number: 61263043, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant Nos. 11365023 and 61263043 ), the Projects of the Science and Technology Research and Development Program of Baoji City (Grant Nos. 15RKX-1-5-14 and 15RKX-1-5-6 ), the Key Project of Baoji University of Arts and Sciences (Grant No. ZK14035 ), and the Joint Fund of Department of Science and Technology of Guizhou Province, Bureau of Science and Technology of Qiandongnan Prefecture, and Kaili University (Grant No. LH-2014-7231 ).

IOP Conf. Ser. Earth Environ. Sci.,"The static ice refrigeration air conditioning system (SIRACS) driven by distributed photovoltaic energy system (DPES) was proposed and the test experiment have been investigated in this paper. Results revealed that system energy utilization efficiency is low because energy losses were high in ice making process of ice slide maker. So the immersed evaporator and co-integrated exchanger were suggested in system structure optimization analysis and the system COP was improved nearly 40%. At the same time, we have researched that ice thickness and ice super-cooled temperature changed along with time and the relationship between system COP and ice thickness was obtained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Open Access,20164903086720,012027,"Xu, Y.F.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"The mechanism of resource allocation for cloud computing not only affects the users’ fairness, but also has a significant impact on resource utilization. Most current resource allocation models did not take into account the indivisible demands, the heterogeneity servers, and the situations multi-server. Dominant resource fairness allocation in heterogeneous systems (DRFH) is a fair and efficient resource allocation mechanism. But solving the DRFH problem is NP-hard. There are significant gaps between solutions obtained by existing heuristic algorithms and optimal solutions. They cannot effectively use server resources, resulting in a waste of resources of servers. In this paper, we propose a novel discrete interior search algorithm (DISA) to solve indivisible demands in heterogeneous servers, with a specific repair operator and task-fit value. Experimental results demonstrate that DISA can well adapt to dynamic changes in user resource request type, obtain the near-optimal solutions, maximize the value of minimum global dominant share and resource utilization. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20163002641216,,"Liu, Xi (1); Zhang, Xiaolu (1); Li, Weidong (1); Zhang, Xuejie (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, No. 2, North Cuihu Road, Wuhua District, Kunmming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.1 Computer Programming - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 912.2 Management - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 961 Systems Science",178619.0,"August 2, 2016 - August 5, 2016","Lanzhou, China","12th International Conference on Intelligent Computing Theories and Application, ICIC 2016",Cloud computing - Heuristic algorithms - Intelligent computing - Learning algorithms - Optimal systems - Optimization - Resource allocation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Xuejie(xjzhang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-42291-6_61,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 61170222, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11361048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11301466, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","The work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 61170222, 11301466, 11361048], and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province of China [No. 2014FB114].",9783319422909.0,03029743,,2016,English,Computation theory,"Intelligent Computing Theories and Application - 12th International Conference, ICIC 2016, Proceedings",17.0,615-626,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Discrete interior search algorithm for multi-resource fair allocation in heterogeneous cloud computing systems,,Dominant resource fairness - Efficient resource allocation - Fair allocation - Heterogeneous servers - Near-optimal solutions - Resource allocation model - Resource utilizations - Search Algorithms,9771
Zhongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban),"In order to investigate the secondary pollution from the recycling process of yellow phosphorus slag by moulding under thermal state, the chemical composition of yellow phosphorus slag was analyzed, and the thermodynamic equilibrium states of harmful elements S, As, F and P in systems of the preparation of the porous ceramics and the glass-ceramics from yellow phosphorus slag were calculated respectively by using the thermodynamic computer software package FactSage 6.1. The results show that in the preparation process of porous ceramics, the release amount of gaseous pollutants from raw material increases gradually with the rise of temperature, and the increases in concentration of S- and As-containing gaseous pollutants are no longer obvious when the temperatures climb up to 900 and 300, respectively; In preparation of glass-ceramics, although the temperature at which each gaseous pollutant begins to release is different from that in the preparation of porous ceramics, the release rules of gaseous pollutants are consistent. When the temperatures in the preparations of the porous ceramics and the glass-ceramics reach 1 200 and 1 400, respectively, all S forms S-containing gaseous species which appears in the form of SO2or the mixture of SO2and SO3, more than 85% of As changes into the gaseous AsF3, less than 4% of F changes into gaseous SiF4, and all P exists in molten Ca3(PO4)2. © 2016, Central South University of Technology.

Chin. Opt. Lett.,"We demonstrate laser-ranging results for non-cooperative targets at ranges of 237 m and 19 km using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SSPD). We upgrade the kilohertz rate laser-ranging system with a newly developed SSPD module, and the equivalent detection diameter is enlarged to 50 μm with a fiber and micro-lenses. Both retroreflectors and non-cooperative surfaces of aluminum foil, a solar panel, and a concrete panel at distances of 237 m and 19 km, whose echoes are of single-photon level, are ranged with sub-centimeter precision. Experimental signal-to-noise ratio curves with the product of quantum efficiency and system transmittance are obtained, which indicates that our system, with an average laser power of 0.8 W and a receiving aperture of 1.2 m, may be capable for space debris ranging at a distance of 800 km.

Adv. Energy Environ. Mater. Sci. Proc. Intern. Conf. Energy Environ. Mater. Sci.,"This paper proposes a novel model of volumetric heat transfer coefficient for Direct-Contact Heat Exchanger (DCHE). This model is based on an integration of single bubble heat-transfer characteristics and the drift-flux model. Bases on experiment, experimental volumetric heat transfer coefficient is obtained at variations initial heat transfer temperature difference, refrigerant flow rate, heat transfer oil flow rate, heat transfer oil height, respectively. These experimental values are used to validate the theoretical model of this paper. The result show that there is a good agreement between the theoretical and experimental values, and the errors are almost within 20%.

Ore Geol. Rev.,"The Luping Pb deposit, a newly discovered Pb-(Fe-Au-Ag-Zn) polymetallic deposit close to the Cenozoic Beiya porphyry-related Au-(Fe-Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag) deposit, is located in the central Sanjiang (three rivers: Jinshajiang, Lancangjiang and Nujiang) region (western Yangtze Block) in southwestern China. Ore bodies of the Luping deposit are mainly stratiform type, host in the Middle Triassic Beiya Formation limestone and Lower Triassic Qingtianbao Formation sandstone, and occur along NNW-trending bedding-plane faults within axis of Beiya-Qinghe syncline. Three ore types, namely the Pb-Au sulfide, Fe-Au, and Au ores, can be discerned regarding their ore metal association with reserves of 2.7million tonnes (Mt) (average grade: 3.06wt.% Pb, 0.66g/t Au, 41g/t Ag, and 0.82wt.% Zn), 3Mt (average grade: 30wt.% Fe, 0.96g/t Au and 31g/t Ag), and 0.67Mt (average grade: 2.16g/t Au and 13g/t Ag), respectively. Pb-Au sulfide ores contain mainly galena, siderite, native gold, sphalerite, and pyrite, with minor chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite, and gangue minerals such as quartz, calcite and dolomite. Sulfide ore textures include mainly brecciated, banded and vein, and minor massive and disseminated. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of alkali-rich quartz syenite porphyry from drill holes yielded a Late Eocene (Priabonian) age (36.2±0.4Ma), broadly coeval to the zircon U-Pb ages (ca. 38Ma-31Ma) of alkaline porphyries and molybdenite Re-Os age (36.9±0.3Ma) from the Beiya deposit near Luping. Calcite separates have δ13CPDB and δ18OSMOW values ranging from -5.8‰ to -5.1‰ (average: -5.6‰) and +13.2‰ to +14.7‰ (mean: +13.6‰), respectively, suggesting association with the mantle. The sulfides have a narrow range of δ34SCDT values (+0.8‰-+2.8‰, mean +1.8‰), which is similar to that of mantle-derived S (0±3‰). 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb values of the sulfides range from 18.62 to 18.69, 15.66 to 15.70 and 38.92 to 39.08, respectively, similar to those of the porphyry whole-rock (206Pb/204Pb 36 Ma=18.61-18.71, 207Pb/204Pb 36 Ma=15.64-15.77 and 208Pb/204Pb 36 Ma=38.88-39.32). Ore deposit geology and C-O-S-Pb isotopic data suggest that the sources of metals and ore-forming fluids were likely to be derived from the alkali-rich porphyries in the Beiya area. We propose that the Luping deposit is best classified as an epithermal Pb polymetallic deposit associated with the Beiya alkaline porphyries (ca. 36Ma-31Ma). Similar to other deposits related to the Cenozoic alkaline porphyries in the Jinshajiang-Red River (Ailaoshan) metallogenic belt, the Luping deposit may have been formed in the India-Eurasia post-collisional setting, when partial melting occurred in the Triassic stagnant slab that thickened the lower crust and the upper mantle, producing the alkaline magmatism and its associated mineralization. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20153101100775,,"Zhou, Jia-Xi (1, 2); Dou, Song (2); Huang, Zhi-Long (1); Cui, Yin-Liang (2, 3); Ye, Lin (1); Li, Bo (3); Gan, Ting (1, 4); Sun, Hai-Rui (1, 4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang; 550081, China (2) Yunnan Non-ferrous Metals Geological Bureau, Kunming; 650051, China (3) Department of Land Resources Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (4) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China ",,481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Binary alloys - Calcite - Copper compounds - Deposits - Economic geology - Exploratory geochemistry - Geochronology - Gold compounds - Gold deposits - Iron alloys - Isotopes - Lead compounds - Lead deposits - Lime - Osmium alloys - Pyrites - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Silicate minerals - Silver alloys - Sulfur compounds - Tectonics - Zinc sulfide - Zircon,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Jia-Xi(zhoujiaxi@vip.gyig.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2015.07.015,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: SKLODG-ZY125-02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2014CB440905, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 41163001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The research is jointly supported by the 12th Five-Year Plan Project of State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. SKLODG-ZY125-02 ), the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB440905 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41163001 and 41402072 ).

Rock Soil Mech,"The determination of the weights of the influencing factors in evaluating the suitability of engineering sites varies greatly among the conventional methods which are generally found unreliable when applied to some engineering sites with complex geology for their failure to reveal the complex relationships between the geological factors. To satisfy the need of selecting proper sites for large-scale key projects, we improve the constant weight to variety weight and introduce the matrix of multifactor interactions into the suitability evaluation of engineering sites, and propose the concept of engineering site suitability index (ESSI), a comprehensive index which is capable of considering the correlations between the influencing factors and the variation of their impact under various tamporospatial dimensions; and therefore put forward a multi-discipline system for evaluating the suitability of engineering sites. The system is used in the site selection for China Spallation Neutron Source(CSNC) Project, and found applicable and reliable by the follow-up engineering investigation. The ESSI system which is based on the matrix of multi-factor interactions is proved scientific, reasonable, and applicable by case studies; and it is expected to provide a reference for similar large-scale engineering. © 2016, Science Press.

J Alloys Compd,"The Bi-doped and Bi-Yb co-doped germanate glasses were fabricated by high temperature melting-quenched technique. The absorption spectra, near-infrared (NIR) luminescence properties and decay time spectra are investigated. The results show that the NIR emission peak around 1030 nm of Yb3+ions and two NIR emission bands around 1180 and 1300 nm of Bi ions are observed, under 690 nm LD excitation. Two NIR emission bands of Bi-related are ascribing in different Bi-related NIR emission centers, Bi0for 1180 nm and Bi+ion for 1300 nm, respectively. NIR luminescence intensity of Yb3+ions, Bi0and Bi+ion is decreased. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is broadening with the increasing in Yb2O3concentration, and over 361 nm.

Polym. Chem.,"Glucose-responsive polymer microgels that can undergo highly selective, reversible, and rapid volume phase transitions in response to fluctuations in blood glucose concentration have the potential to regulate insulin delivery to improve patient compliance and health. Herein, we report such a glucose-responsive polymer microgel, which is made of a representative apo-enzyme, apo-glucose oxidase (apo-GOx), interpenetrated in a chemically-crosslinked network of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM). Introduction of apo-GOx into the pNIPAM network made the newly developed semi-interpenetrating-structured microgels responsive with high selectivity to glucose over a glucose concentration range of 0-20 mM at a physiological pH value of 7.4. While the microgels could swell and reach stability shortly (-1s-1with a ca. 10.1 s-1dissociation rate constant, indicating a fast reversible time response to the glucose concentration change of the microgels. With the microgels as carriers, in vitro insulin release could be modulated in a pulsatile profile in response to glucose concentrations, and in vivo studies revealed that these formulations may improve glucose control in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice subcutaneously administered with the insulin loaded microgels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,20162002383548,,"Ye, Ting (1); Bai, Xue (1); Jiang, Xiaomei (2); Wu, Qingshi (1); Chen, Shoumin (1); Qu, Anqi (1); Huang, Junwei (1); Shen, Jing (3); Wu, Weitai (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials, Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen; Fujian; 361005, China (2) Clinical Laboratory, Huli Center for Maternal and Child Health, Xiamen; Fujian; 361009, China (3) Department of Applied Chemistry, College of Vocational Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650092, China ",,"461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 462.1 Biomedical Equipment, General - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,,Acrylic monomers - Dissociation - Gels - Glucose - Glucose sensors - Insulin - pH - Rate constants,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Weitai(wuwtxmu@xmu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6py00179c,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17599962,,,,17599954,16,"April 28, 2016",English,Glucose oxidase,,71.0,2847-2857,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,Polymer Chemistry,,Glucose-responsive microgels based on apo-enzyme recognition,,Association rate constants - Blood glucose concentration - Cross-linked networks - Dissociation rate constant - Glucose concentration - Hydrodynamic diameter - Poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) - Volume phase transition,7

High Temp Mater Processes,"The clean utilization of the residue containing chloride, such as zinc oxide dust and CuCl residue, produced from zinc hydrometallurgy is very important for the recycle of valuable metals. In this paper, a new technology for dechlorination of the CuCl residue through thermal treatment with application of microwave and oxygen-enriched air roasting is brought out. And the response surface methodology (RSM) based on five-level, three-variable and central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize the operation parameters for increasing the dechlorination efficiency. The effects of temperature, roasting time and oxygen consumption on the dechlorination efficiency were studied and the optimal process conditions were identified. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the dechlorination process under the optimum condition. The results showed that the experimental data were fitted to a second-order polynomial equation. The optimized process conditions are identified to be a roasting temperature of 451?, heating duration of 114 min and oxygen consumption of 2.4 times the theoretical oxygen demand. A dechlorination efficiency of 96.4% could be achieved at the optimal process conditions. © 2016 by De Gruyter.",,20160801966443,,"Zhanyong, Guo (1, 2, 3); Shaohua, Ju (1, 2, 3); Jinhui, Peng (1, 2, 3); Libo, Zhang (1, 2, 3); Ting, Lei (4) ","(1) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) National Local Joint Laboratory of Engineering Application of Microwave Energy and Equipment Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (4) Kunming Metallurgy College, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",HTMPEF,531.1 Metallurgy - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921.1 Algebra - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Calcination - Chlorine compounds - Dechlorination - Efficiency - Hydrometallurgy - II-VI semiconductors - Ores - Oxygen - Polynomials - Scanning electron microscopy - Surface properties - Temperature - X ray diffraction - Zinc oxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shaohua, Ju(shj_200801@126.com) ",10.1515/htmp-2014-0177,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of Bangladesh; Number: 2013HA002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51104073, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Funding: The National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51104073) and Technology of People’s Republic of China, Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents scheme, Technological Leading Talent (No. 2013HA002).",,03346455,2,"February 1, 2016",English,Copper compounds,,17.0,135-143,,2016,Walter de Gruyter GmbH and Co.

High Temp Mater Processes,"In this work, microwave energy is used for preparing a granular red mud (GRM) adsorbent made of red mud with different binders, such as starch, sodium silicate and cement. The effects of the preparation parameters, such as binder type, binder addition ratio, microwave heating temperature, microwave power and holding time, on the absorption property of GRM are investigated. The BET surface area, strength, pore structure, XRD and SEM of the GRM absorbent are analyzed. The results show that the microwave roasting has a good effect on pore-making of GRM, especially when using organic binder. Both the BET surface area and the strength of GRM obtained by microwave heating are significantly higher than that by conventional heating. The optimum conditions are obtained as follows: 6:100 (w/w) of starch to red mud ratio, microwave roasting with a power of 2.6 kW at 500â., for holding time of 30 min.

Phys B Condens Matter,"This study prepared a Zn-rich single crystal β-Zn4Sb3using a Sn flux method based on the stoichiometric ratios of Zn4.4Sb3Sn3. The oxidation resistance of the sample was determined by exploring the effects of heat treatment in air on electrical transport properties and thermal stability, which is of practical importance in the application of the material at high temperatures. Results showed that the prepared sample possessed high electrical transport properties, with a high power factor of 1.67×10−3 W m−1 K−2at 563 K. The heat treatment in air weakened the electrical conductivity of the single crystalline β-Zn4Sb3, whereas the Seebeck coefficients were rarely independent of the annealing condition. Eventually, the power factor obtained after the first heating at 523 K for 4 h became comparable to that of the as-prepared sample, although it decreased after the second heating at 573 K for 5 h.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"Multiple cropping systems are the way to cope with the shortage of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) resources and enhance the utilization ratio of land. The aim of this study was to investigate seventy Gentiana rigescens Franch samples which were planted in slope and in multiple cropping system mixed with Juglans regia, Alnus nepalensis, Eucalyptus robusta, Alnus nepalensis, Camellia sinensis, Chaenomeles sinensis using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The pretreatments such as baseline correction, normalization and second derivative of all the original spectra were performed with Omnic 8.0 software. Moreover, second derivative spectra of samples and gentiopicroside standard were analyzed. In addition, two spectral databases were set up based on the average spectra of every variety with Omnic 8.0 software. The first library (Lib1) which included the spectra region from 1 800 to 600 cm-1had the algorithm of expert retrieve while the correlation retrieve and square differential retrieve were dealt with the second library (Lib2) in the full spectral range. The results indicated that it is difficult to identify the infrared spectra of samples directly because they had high similarities. There were multiple common peaks between spectra of samples and gentiopicroside standards. The absorption peaks of 1 611 and 1 076 cm-1of gentiopicroside were the two main characteristic peaks in the second derivative spectra. The difference of peak shape of every sample in the wave number of 1 076 cm-1was small. By comparing peak area at 1 611 cm-1, the samples planted with J. regia contained highest content of gentiopicroside while the content of this effective constituent was the lowest in the samples which were planted in the slope and in the multiple cropping systems mixed with C sinensis. The differences of effective components in the samples with different planting patterns were represented by the variances of spectral matching values. The difference of matching values of samples planted with J. regia, A. nepalensis, E. Robusta and A. nepalensis were lower than that with slope and C. Sinensis. The number of misjudgment of expert retrieval, correlation retrieve and square differential retrieve were 11, 4 and 9, respectively. The discrimination result of correlation retrieve was the best in the full spectral range and the correct recognition rate was 94.29%.

Therefore, a maximum four order correlated kurtosis deconvolution( M4CKD) algorithm is presented on the basis of the kurtosis variation of mixed signals and the corresponding inverse filter is designed. Moreover, the convergence of the algorithm are analyzed. The results shown that the super Gauss and Gauss noise of mixed signal can be effectively suppressed, and this algorithm has faster convergence speed and higher signal-To-noise ratio which compared with FastICA algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.",,20172303724981,7920232,"Chong, Shan (1); Yang, Guangyong (1); Chen, Yuebin (1) ","(1) School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,127670.0,"November 28, 2016 - November 30, 2016","Pisa, Italy","10th European Modelling Symposium on Computer Modelling and Simulation, UKSim-AMSS 2016",Deconvolution - Extraction - Gaussian distribution - Higher order statistics - Maximum entropy methods - Signal processing - Signal to noise ratio,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Guangyong(guangyongjang@126.com) ",10.1109/EMS.2016.023,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509049707.0,,,"May 4, 2017",English,Blind source separation,Proceedings - UKSim-AMSS 2016: 10th European Modelling Symposium on Computer Modelling and Simulation,10.0,75-78,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Proceedings - UKSim-AMSS 2016: 10th European Modelling Symposium on Computer Modelling and Simulation,,Blind Extraction of Nonstationary Signal with Four Order Correlation Kurtosis Deconvolution,,component - Fast-ICA - Faster convergence - FastICA algorithms - Filter algorithm - Gradient search method - Local Convergence - Nonstationary signals,

Acta Mech. Solida Sin.,"The specific good properties of cellular materials and composite materials, such as low density and high permeability, make the optimal design of such materials necessary and attractive. However, the given materials for the structures may not be optimal or suitable since the boundary condition and applied loads vary in practical applications; hence the macro-structure and its material micro-structure should be considered simultaneously. Although abundant studies have been reported on the structural and material optimization at each level, very few of them considered the mutual coordination on both scales. In this paper, two FE models are built for the macro-structure and the micro-structure, respectively; and the effective elastic properties of the periodic micro-structure are blended into the analysis of macro-structure by the homogenization theory. Here, a topological optimum is obtained by gradually re-distributing the constituents within the micro-structure and updating the topological shape at the macro-structure until converges are achieved on both scales. The mutual coordination between the roles of micro-scale and macro-scale is considered. Some numerical examples are presented, which illustrate that the proposed optimization algorithm is effective and highly efficient for the micro-structure design and macro-structure optimization. For the composite design, one can see reasonable effects of the stiffness of base materials on the resultant topologies. © 2016 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics",,20165303204075,,"Wang, Xianjie (1); Qin, Yun (1); Zhang, Xun'an (2) ","(1) School of Urban Construction and Management, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Mechanics, Civil Engineering and Architecture, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an; 710129, China ",,"408.1 Structural Design, General - 921 Mathematics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Composite materials - Homogenization method - Periodic structures - Shape optimization - Structural optimization - Topology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Xianjie(xianjiewang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/S0894-9166(16)30336-6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18602134,,,,08949166,6,"December 1, 2016",English,Structural design,,20.0,663-674,,2016,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica,,Concurrent Analysis and Design of Structure and Its Periodic Materials,,Effective elastic property - Homogenization theory - Material microstructures - Material optimization - Multi-scale - Optimization algorithms - Periodic cellular materials - Periodic composites,29

Ruan Jian Xue Bao,"This paper presents a data-driven method for rapid 3D garment modeling, which can efficiently generate new garments by examples. First, a semantic segmentation is applied to simultaneously segment and label the components in given 3D garments using shape analysis of garment styles. Second, the garment components are clustered into a garment component library with four categories including tops, bottoms, sleeves, and accessories. Third, a continuous style description of the 3D garments, characterized by the ratio of area and boundary length, is constructed to recommend components that can be regarded as a new 3D garment. The final new suitable garments are produced by optimizing two component meshes. Experimental results show that the presented method is able to satisfy the new requirements of online 3D model collections while ensuring the efficiency of 3D garment modeling. © Copyright 2016, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

RSC Adv.,"V2O5micro-particles were obtained by the mechanical milling process combined with a simple sintering treatment using commercial V2O5powder as a raw material. We successfully adopted the hydroxylation of tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti) in air and a post-sintering procedure to synthesize the TiO2-coated V2O5micro-particles. Afterwards, systematic electrochemical characterization was performed to evaluate the electrochemical performance of V2O5micro-particles as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with and without the TiO2coating. As for the V2O5micro-particles, the maximum discharge specific capacity reaches 247.8 mA h g-1, which gradually decreases to 212.6 mA h g-1after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1between 2 and 4 V (vs. Li/Li+). Under the same conditions, TiO2coated V2O5micro-particles deliver the highest capacity of 246.6 mA h g-1and keeps at 229.1 mA h g-1for the 50thcycle. The results indicated that the TiO2coating could effectively suppress the electrochemical property degradation of V2O5crystalline micro-particles, improving its cycling stability during long-term charge-discharge measurements through the protective role of the TiO2layer. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20162402503791,,"Zhou, Xiaowei (1); He, Taoling (1); Chen, Xu (1); Sun, Li (1, 2); Liu, Zhu (1, 3) ","(1) Laboratory of Nano-materials and Energy Technology, Department of Physics, School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Houston, Houston; TX; 77204, United States (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano-Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",RSCACL,531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 604.2 Machining Operations - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 813.2 Coating Materials - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Cathodes - Characterization - Coatings - Electric discharges - Electrochemical properties - Mechanical alloying - Milling (machining) - Sintering - Titanium dioxide - Vanadium pentoxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Xiaowei(zhouxiaowei@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6ra12162d,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,59,2016,English,Lithium-ion batteries,,35.0,53925-53932,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Influence of TiO2surface coating on the electrochemical properties of V2O5micro-particles as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries,,Cath-ode materials - Cycling stability - Discharge specific capacity - Electrochemical characterizations - Electrochemical performance - Mechanical milling - Sintering treatment - Tetra-butyl titanate,6

Sol. Energy,"A novel heat recovery and thermal storage solar-assisted heat pump drying system was set up. Moreover, the effect of different economic variables on payback period was investigated. The evaporator and condenser were integrated in the drying chamber and the water storage tank was set up in the system to recover the heat effectively and improve the utilization of solar energy. Based on a total required heat of 23.157 MJ for drying 10 kg of radish process, the theoretical analysis results illustrated that when the daily average radiation intensity was 0.480 kW/m2the system run at solar drying (SD) mode; when the daily average radiation intensity ranged from 0.430 kW/m2to 0.480 kW/m2the system run at the solar-assisted heat pump drying (SAHPD) mode; when the daily average radiation intensity was less than 0.430 kW/m2, the system run at the heat pump drying (HPD) mode. The experimental results showed that the coefficient of performance of the drying system was ranged from 3.21 to 3.49 at the SAHPD mode. Furthermore, the SAHPD can save energy consumption by 40.53% in terms of heat recovery and thermal storage. The payback period for drying radish, pepper, and mushroom in the life span of the system was 6 years, 4 years, and 2 years, respectively.

J. Heat Transf.,"The classical problem of constrained melting heat transfer of a phase change material (PCM) inside a spherical capsule was revisited experimentally in the presence of nanoscale thermal conductivity fillers. The model nano-enhanced PCM (NePCM) samples were prepared by dispersing self-synthesized graphite nanosheets (GNSs) into 1-dodecanol at various loadings up to 1% by mass. The melting experiments were carried out using an indirect method by measuring the instantaneous volume expansion upon melting. The data analysis was performed based on the homogeneous, single-component assumption for NePCM with modified thermophysical properties. It was shown that the introduction of nanofillers increases the effective thermal conductivity of NePCM, in accompaniment with an undesirable rise in viscosity. The dramatic viscosity growth, up to over 100-fold at the highest loading, deteriorates significantly the intensity of natural convection, which was identified as the dominant mode of heat transfer during constrained melting. The loss in natural convection was found to overweigh the decent enhancement in heat conduction, thus resulting in decelerated melting in the presence of nanofillers. Except for the case with the lowest heating boundary temperature, a monotonous slowing trend of melting was observed with increasing the loading. © 2016 by ASME.",,20163602768871,122402,"Fan, Li-Wu (1, 2); Zhu, Zi-Qin (1); Liu, Min-Jie (1); Xu, Can-Ling (1); Zeng, Yi (3); Lu, Hai (4); Yu, Zi-Tao (1, 2) ","(1) Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems, School of Energy Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (3) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn; AL; 36849, United States (4) Electric Power Research Institute, Yunnan Electric Power and Research Institute (Group), Kunming, Yunnan; 650217, China ",JHTRAO,"631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 933 Solid State Physics",,,,,Digital storage - Fillers - Graphite - Heat conduction - Heat storage - Melting - Nanosheets - Natural convection - Spheres - Thermal conductivity - Thermal energy - Viscosity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1115/1.4034163,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15288943,"Number: 51276159, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This material is based upon work supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant No. 51276159.

Int. J. Heat Technol.,"Geothermal gradient is one of the most important parameters for geothermal exploration and exploitation. Mud is generally used as a drilling fluid in geothermal wells. According to energy conservation law, when the drilling penetrates through an aquifuge or aquitard, its temperature can be used to establish the mathematical analysis model for estimating the geothermal gradient. The recorded mud temperatures in some practical drilling cases in southwest China have been applied to study the influence radius of geotherm that is conducted by surrounding rock into the derived formula. The fitting calculation results show that the absolute error is generally very low, being less than 10%, which indicates that the proposed formula can be used to effectively predict the geothermal gradient. The calculation indicates that it is only when the rock conductive influencing radius is very small (around 0.25m) that it is possible to have a reasonable solution.",Open Access,20162902614095,,"Xu, Shiguang Xu (1, 2); Ba, Junjie (1); Chen, Xianfeng (3); Zheng, Ting (4); Yang, Yaochi (5); Guo, Liang (6) ","(1) Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Geologic and Mineral Bureau of Exploration and Exploitation, Kunming; 650051, China (3) Yunnan Lan and Resources Vocational College, Kunming; 652501, China (4) Kunming Prospecting Design Institute of China Nonferrous Metals Industry, Kunming; 650011, China (5) Yunnan Tonghui Resource Exploration Company(Ltd), Kunming; 650011, China (6) Yunnan Geotechnical Engineering Investigation Design Research Institute, Kunming; 650051, China ",HETEEE,"444.2 Groundwater - 481.3.1 Geothermal Phenomena - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Aquifers - Drilling fluids - Energy conservation - Geothermal energy - Geothermal prospecting - Geothermal wells - Physical properties - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ba, Junjie(bajunjie@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.18280/ijht.340227,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,03928764,2,2016,English,Rock drilling,,39.0,345-350,,2016,Edizioni ETS,International Journal of Heat and Technology,,Predicting strata temperature distribution from drilling fluid temperature,,Calculation results - Derived formulae - Energy conservation law - Fluid temperatures - Geothermal exploration - Geothermal gradients - Influencing radius - Mathematical analysis,34
Sensors,"In this paper, the multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified screen-printed electrode (MWCNTs/SPE) was prepared and the MWCNTs/SPE was employed for the electrochemical determination of the antioxidant substance chlorogenic acids (CGAs). A pair of well-defined redox peaks of CGA was observed at the MWCNTs/SPE in 0.10 mol/L acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.2) and the electrode process was adsorption-controlled. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) methods for the determination of CGA were proposed based on the MWCNTs/SPE. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed method exhibited linear ranges from 0.17 to 15.8 µg/mL, and the linear regression equation was Ipa (µA) = 4.1993 C (×10−5mol/L) + 1.1039 (r = 0.9976) and the detection limit for CGA could reach 0.12 µg/mL.

Signal Process,"In multiscale transform (MST)-based multifocus image fusion, the fusion rules of different subbands are a significant factor that affects the fusion performance. However, dependence only on new fusion rule will see no significant performance gain for a MST-based method. To address this problem, this paper proposes two novel multifocus image fusion techniques based on multi-scale and multi-direction neighbor distance (MMND), in which the improvements of the fusion performance are respectively achieved by two new developed updating schemes. These two schemes are constructed according to the fact that the difference between a low quality fused result and the source image in the focused region is sharper than those generated by a high quality fused result. Based on this fact, the pixels of the source images are classified into three types in the updating mechanism, namely, pixels of focused significant regions, pixels of smooth regions, pixels of transition area between the focused and defocused regions. According to the categories of source images pixels, we can update the fused result produced by the MMND method in spatial and the MMND domain. Extensive experimental results validate that the proposed two fusion schemes can achieve better results than some state-of-the art algorithms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Signal Image Process., ICSIP","With the development of optical character recognition research, many techniques for printed character recognition have been developed. But the character recognition study for the New Tai Lue has lagged behind. As a result, the digital processes of New Tai Lue have been in troubles. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a printed New Tai Lue character recognition method based on the Back Propagation (BP) Neural Network. Firstly, some image preprocessing including skew image correction, binarization are performed on the New Tai Lue images obtained by a scanner. Secondly, the character segmentation is carried out after the text line segmentation and the word segmentation processes. Thirdly, the feature vectors are built by using the local gray feature, the centroid coordinate and the original size of the image; Lastly, A BP neural network is trained with a training set contained 51740 samples. Then a test set contained 4917 samples is applied to test the performance of the proposed method.

RSC Adv.,This study describes the synthesis and solution properties of the novel linear-dendritic block copolymers (LDBCs) based on thermoresponsive poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) chains and pH-responsive poly(benzyl ether) dendrons. The peripherally methyl ester-functionalized LDBCs (CH3OOC-Gn-b-PNVCL) were first synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of N-vinylcaprolactam (NVCL) using first- and second-generation dendritic poly(benzyl ether) chlorides with methyl ester peripheries as initiators. Their peripheral methyl ester groups were then hydrolyzed to afford the target thermoresponsive and pH-responsive poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)-based LDBCs (NaOOC-Gn-b-PNVCL). The results of1H NMR and GPC analysis showed that the synthesized LDBCs have controlled molecular weight and narrow polydispersity. The results of turbidity and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements demonstrated that the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) values of synthesized LDBCs decrease with increase in the generation of the dendritic poly(benzyl ethers) and the concentrations of the LDBCs solutions. The thermoresponsive behavior of NaOOC-Gn-b-PNVCL was also influenced by the pH value of the copolymer solutions. The self-assembly behavior of the LDBCs in an aqueous solution was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicated that the morphology of the amphiphilic CH3OOC-Gn-b-PNVCL in an aqueous phase changed from rod-like dendritic structure to a microrectangle shape with increase in the generation of the dendritic poly(benzyl ethers). CH3OOC-Gn-b-PNVCL form more well-defined aggregates. Second critical micelle concentration of NaOOC-G1-b-PNVCL has been observed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.,,20162102409585,,"Tang, Gang (1); Hu, Minqi (1); Ma, Yongcui (1); You, Dan (1); Bi, Yunmei (1) ","(1) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",RSCACL,502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 815.2 Polymerization - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Atom transfer radical polymerization - Block copolymers - Chlorine compounds - Critical micelle concentration - Dynamic light scattering - Esters - Ethers - Fluorescence spectroscopy - Free radical reactions - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Self assembly - Solutions - Transmission electron microscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bi, Yunmei(yunmeibi@hotmail.com) ",10.1039/c6ra04327e,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 21564017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21264017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors gratefully acknowledge support for this study from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21264017 and 21564017).,,,49,2016,English,Solution mining,,54.0,42786-42793,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Synthesis and solution properties of novel thermo- and pH-responsive poly (N-vinylcaprolactam)-based linear-dendritic block copolymers,,Controlled molecular weight - Copolymer solution - Dendritic structures - Linear-dendritic block copolymer (LDBCs) - Lower critical solution temperature - Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) - Self-assembly behaviors - Thermo-responsive behaviors,6
Neurocomputing,"With the rapid advance of Internet technology and smart devices, users often need to manage large amounts of multimedia information using smart devices, such as personal image and video accessing and browsing. These requirements heavily rely on the success of image (video) annotation, and thus large scale image annotation through innovative machine learning methods has attracted intensive attention in recent years. One representative work is support vector machine (SVM). Although it works well in binary classification, SVM has a non-smooth loss function and can not naturally cover multi-class case. In this paper, we propose manifold regularized kernel logistic regression (KLR) for web image annotation. Compared to SVM, KLR has the following advantages: (1) the KLR has a smooth loss function; (2) the KLR produces an explicit estimate of the probability instead of class label; and (3) the KLR can naturally be generalized to the multi-class case. We carefully conduct experiments on MIR FLICKR dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of manifold regularized kernel logistic regression for image annotation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20152200890766,,"Liu, Weifeng (1); Liu, Hongli (1); Tao, Dapeng (2); Wang, Yanjiang (1); Lu, Ke (3) ","(1) China University of Petroleum, China (2) Yunnan University, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China ",NRCGEO,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,Image analysis - Image retrieval - Learning algorithms - Regression analysis - Supervised learning - Support vector machines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tao, Dapeng(dapeng.tao@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.neucom.2014.06.096,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18728286,"Number: JCYJ20140901003939001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CUPB, Sponsor: China University of Petroleum, Beijing; Number: 2014A030310252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 61271407, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61301242, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61301242, 61271407 ), the Guangdong Natural Science Funds (Grant No. 2014A030310252 ), the Shenzhen Technology Project (Grant No. JCYJ20140901003939001 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Petroleum (East China).",,09252312,,"January 8, 2016",English,Image annotation,,20.0,3-8,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Neurocomputing,,Manifold regularized kernel logistic regression for web image annotation,,Binary classification - Kernel logistic regression - Laplacian eigenmaps - Machine learning methods - Manifold regularizations - Multimedia information - Semi- supervised learning - Web image annotations,172

For different frequencies, the proposed transmitter can simultaneously employ 1-bit Low-pass and Band-pass delta-sigma modulators structures, or employ hybrid structures. Carrier frequencies are equal to oversampling frequencies of modulators. Besides, signals on two carriers are not interfered with each other to ensure transmission dual-band signal.

"Prog. Electromagn. Res. Symp., PIERS - Proc.","We proposed a novel micro strip sensor based on Dual-D shaped Complementary Split Resonator (Dual-D CSR) in the microwave region. In this research, the distribution of the electric field and transmission response (S21) have been simulated. Besides, we also investigated the effect of the width between Dual-D on resonance characteristics. Furthermore, the process and the performance is illustrated when Dual-D CSR is used as a sensor. Simulation results show that the reflection spectrum moves to the lower frequency side with respect to a small change of sample permittivity, and the relation between resonant frequency and sample permittivity reveals a good linearity. Finally, the Dual-D CSR can increase the interaction area between electric field and sample. This feature making the sensor very sensitivity to surrounding sample substances. In addition, the simplicity of such sensing structure enables its utilization in a wide frequency range by simply varying the geometric parameter of resonator. Such device have potential applications in dielectric sensing, especially for the detection of liquid. © 2016 IEEE.",,20165203169787,7735639,"Li, Xi Ming (1); Xie, Zheng Peng (1); Yang, Mei Xia (1); Yang, Jing Jing (1); Huang, Ming (1) ","(1) Wireless Innovation Lab. of Yunnan University, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 714 Electronic Components and Tubes - 732.2 Control Instrumentation,124897.0,"August 8, 2016 - August 11, 2016","Shanghai, China","2016 Progress In Electromagnetics Research Symposium, PIERS 2016",Electric fields - Microwave resonators - Natural frequencies - Permittivity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735639,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 20125301120009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20135301110003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015FA015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013FA006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61461052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61261002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11564044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Our work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61261002, 61461052, 11564044), and was supported by the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (Grant No. 20135301110003, 20125301120009), and the Key Program of Natural Science of Yunnan Province (Grant Nos. 2013FA006, 2015FA015).",9781509060931.0,,,"November 3, 2016",English,Microwave sensors,"2016 Progress In Electromagnetics Research Symposium, PIERS 2016 - Proceedings",11.0,4415-4418,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 Progress In Electromagnetics Research Symposium, PIERS 2016 - Proceedings",,Simulation and analysis of a micro strip sensor based on Dual-D shaped Complementary Split Resonator,,Dielectric sensing - Lower frequencies - Microwave region - Reflection spectra - Resonance characteristic - Simulation and analysis - Transmission response - Wide frequency range,
"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf. Web Serv., ICWS","Reputation systems have become an important means to help users build trust, reduce information asymmetry and filter information in the context of online services provision. Different users cannot rate services under the same criteria due to the scale and dynamism of these systems. Thus, aggregating cardinal ratings into reputation will potentially lead to unreliable and misleading result, which makes reputation systems necessarily consider the impossibility of interpersonal utility comparisons. In this paper, we exploit the ordinal user preferences between services to compute reputation of services. A distance metric is defined to measure the discrepancy between two rating vectors and the reputation computation problem was formalized as an optimization problem. Then, genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem to find a reputation vector that minimizes the total number of disagreements with the rating matrix.

Trans Can Soc Mech Eng,"Articulated industrial robots are widely used for factory automation, e.g., the car manufacture industry. As other machines, the transmission system of industrial robot is prone to fail after long term operation. Speed reducer is the key component of the transmission system, and it is important to detect its incipient faults to avoid breaking down. However, until now, few techniques have been proposed to diagnose the reducer without disassembly. Our research on monitoring and diagnosing the speed reducer of industrial robot is reported in this paper. The technique combines inspection method of acoustic emission and signal processing of vibration signal. The characteristics of acoustic emission signal and their connections with mechanical parts of robot reducer have been studied. A defect in the rolling bearing was detected on a welding robot by this technique and confirmed in disassembly. © 2016, Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering.

Prog. Electromagn. Res. Lett.,"Orbital angular momentum (OAM) with a huge potential application in multiplexing and coding has become the subject of intense research in recent years. This paper presents a method to generate radio beams carrying OAM based on a circular patch antenna. A 3 dB quadrature hybrid is employed in the design to enable the circular patch to reconfigure opposite OAM states of a radiated field. The results of numerical simulations are presented to show that the circular patch radiates two OAM modes with opposite rotation directions simultaneously. The proposed circular patch is believed to be significant to the wireless communication applications due to its simple geometry, low cost, and OAM mode reconfiguration. © 2016, Electromagnetics Academy.

Mater Sci Semicond Process,"In this study, the impacts of different precursors on Cu2ZnSnS4thin film solar cells were investigated. The two kinds of precursors of (Cu+Sn)/Zn and (Cu+Sn)/ZnS were deposited on Mo-coated soda lime glasses by magnetron sputtering. Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) films based on different precursors were fabricated by soft annealing and following two-step sulfurization in sulphur vapour. The crystal structure, phase purity, surface morphology, composition and optical properties of CZTS films from different precursors were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy, respectively. As a result, the CZTS thin films with smooth surface and uniform compositional ratio distribution were obtained from the precursors of (Cu+Sn)/ZnS.

"IEEE CITS - Int. Conf. Comput., Inf. Telecommun. Syst.","Spatial co-location patterns represent the subsets of features whose instances are frequently located together in geographic space. It is difficult to discover co-location patterns because of the huge amount of space data. A common framework for mining spatial co-location patterns employs a level-wised search method to discover co-location patterns, and generates numerous redundant patterns which need huge cost of space storage and time consumption. Longer size patterns may have more interesting information for users, which causes the requirement for mining longer size patterns preferentially. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to discover compact co-location patterns called top-k-size maximal co-location patterns by introducing a new data structure - MCP-tree, where k is a desired number of distinct sizes of mined co-location patterns. Our algorithm doesn't need to generate all candidate co-locations and it only checks partial candidates to mine top-k-size maximal co-location patterns, so it needs less space and costs less time. The experiment result shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163802815481,7546421,"Bao, Xuguang (1); Wang, Lizhen (1); Zhao, Jiasong (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",123384.0,"July 6, 2016 - July 8, 2016","Kunming, China","2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, CITS 2016",Digital storage - Forestry - Location - Trees (mathematics),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Lizhen(lzhwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1109/CITS.2016.7546421,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by grants (No. 61472346, No.61262069) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and in part by a grant (No. 2015FB149, No.2015FB114) from the Science Foundation of Yunnan Province.",9781509034406.0,,,"August 16, 2016",English,Data mining,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",11.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks (ISN); Xidian University; Yunnan Minzu University,Mining top-k-size maximal co-location patterns,,Co-location patterns - Interesting information - MCP-tree - Novel algorithm - Redundant patterns - Spatial co-location patterns - Spatial data mining - Time consumption,
J. Mater. Chem. A,"A prerequisite for creating green hydrogen energy is to develop cost-effective electrocatalysts with reduced overpotentials, increased current density, and therefore enhanced catalytic activity toward water splitting. We present here the fabrication of an alloyed Pt-Ru-M (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo)-decorated titanium mesh by a simple electrodeposition technique. The resultant electrocatalysts were thoroughly characterized and evaluated by catalyzing seawater splitting. The preliminary results demonstrate that the titanium-mesh-supported Pt-Ru-M electrodes have markedly enhanced catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in comparison to the corresponding Pt or Pt-Ru electrode, arising from the alloying effects between the transition metals and Pt species. Moreover, the resultant Pt-Ru-Mo alloy electrodes show remarkable stability over 172 h of operation, suggesting their promise for use in practical applications. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20162102406691,,"Li, Hongyan (1); Tang, Qunwei (1); He, Benlin (1); Yang, Peizhi (2) ","(1) Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao; 266100, China (2) Key Laboratory of Advanced Technique and Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",JMCAET,"471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 542.3 Titanium and Alloys - 543.3 Molybdenum and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 723.5 Computer Applications - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 911.2 Industrial Economics",,,,,Binary alloys - Catalyst activity - Cost effectiveness - Electrocatalysts - Electrodes - Electrolysis - Mesh generation - Platinum alloys - Platinum metals - Ruthenium alloys - Seawater - Ternary alloys - Titanium,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Qunwei(tangqunwei@ouc.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6ta00785f,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20507496,"Number: 05300205020516009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1037604, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21503202, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors acknowledge nancial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21503202, U1037604) and the Collaborative Innovation Center of Research and Development of Renewable Energy in the Southwest Area (05300205020516009).",,20507488,17,2016,English,Molybdenum alloys,,36.0,6513-6520,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,,"Robust electrocatalysts from an alloyed Pt-Ru-M (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo)-decorated Ti mesh for hydrogen evolution by seawater splitting",,Alloy electrodes - Alloying effect - Electrodeposition technique - Enhanced catalytic activity - Hydrogen Energy - Hydrogen evolution - Hydrogen evolution reactions - Water splitting,4
RSC Adv.,"Lanthanum doped SnO2well-oriented layered nanorod arrays were synthesized by a substrate-free hydrothermal route of using sodium stannate and sodium hydroxide at 210 °C. The morphology and phase structure of the La-doped SnO2nanoarrays were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the BET method. The results showed that the La-doped SnO2layered nanorod array demonstrated a unique nanostructure combined together with double layers of nanorod arrays and could be indexed to a tetragonal structure. The gas sensing performance of La-doped SnO2nanoarrays indicated that La doping could enhance the sensing response to acetone. The 3.0 at% La-doped level of the SnO2sensor not only showed good selectivity and excellent stability, but also exhibited a rapid response and recovery compared to the pristine and other La-doped levels of SnO2nanoarrays.

High Temp Mater Processes,"The clean utilization of the CuCl residue containing chloride produced from zinc hydrometallurgy residue is very important for the recycle of valuable metals. A new method of microwave roasting under oxygen enriched condition was put forward to strengthen the process of dechlorination. It was demonstrated that the dechlorination rate of CuCl residue by microwave roasting was higher than that of conventional roasting by tubular resistance furnace under the same conditions (temperature, holding time and atmosphere). After roasting at a temperature of 450°C for 120 min under an oxygen flow rate of 150 mL/min in microwave field, the dechlorination rate of CuCl residue was as high as 97%, increasing 17% compared to that of conventional roasting using tubular resistance furnace. The characterizations of phase variation of CuCl residue in microwave field by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and Raman spectroscopy indicated that the process of dechlorination by microwave roasting under the oxygen enriched condition was much more efficient than conventional roasting. © 2016 by De Gruyter.",,20162102405954,,"Zhanyong, Guo (1, 2, 3); Ting, Lei (4); Wei, Li (1, 2, 3); Shaohua, Ju (1, 2, 3); Jinhui, Peng (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) National Local Joint Laboratory of Engineering Application of Microwave Energy and Equipment Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (4) Kunming Metallurgy College, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",HTMPEF,531.1 Metallurgy - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Calcination - Chlorine compounds - Dechlorination - Electric furnaces - Hydrometallurgy - Microwaves - Ores - Oxygen - Scanning electron microscopy - Spectrometers - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shaohua, Ju(shj_200801@126.com) ",10.1515/htmp-2014-0206,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: MIIT, Sponsor: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: 51104073, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013HA002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51104073), Technology of People's Republic of China, Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents scheme, Technological Leading Talent (No. 2013HA002).",,03346455,5,"May 1, 2016",English,Copper compounds,,28.0,479-485,,2016,Walter de Gruyter GmbH and Co.

Int. J. Simul. Syst. Sci. Technol.,"Most Domain-Specific Metamodeling Languages (DSMML) use informal method to define their semantics, so it is difficult to precisely and automatically analyze characteristics of metamodels built based on DSMML. In response, based on formalization of DSMML called XMML developed by us, the paper proposes an approach for automatically verifying metamodels consistency by an automatic mapping mechanism to automatically translate metamodels to the corresponding first-order logic system. Firstly, we briefly present our approach for formalizing XMML and its metamodels, and then, we establish an automatic mapping mechanism for formalizing metamodels, finally, we develop an automatic mapping tool for formalizing metamodels and perform relevant experiments to validate our method. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

Acta Geophys. Sin.,"For the 2001 MS8.1 Kunlun earthquake, which was one of the largest events occurred around the Tibet plateau, a large controversy still exists about its rupture detail. In this paper, we invert the co-seismic GPS and InSAR data for a robust finite-fault model of the Kunlun earthquake based on a realistic fault geometry buried in a layered earth structure. The inversion is based on the constrained least-squares principle and realized using the steepest decent method (SDM). The different data sets are weighted according to their variance and spatial coverage. The results show that the slip maximum can reach up to ~6.9 m and is located at 35.76°N and 93.40°E. The main rupture area is located at the shallow depth above 20 km. The inverted shallow slip agrees with the surface rupture observed by the field survey, and the whole slip pattern appears generally consistent with the results obtained from previous geological and seismic wave studies. © 2016, Science Press.

Ecol. Model.,"Human activities are the main drivers of alterations of regional N cycles. With increasing population and economic development, human-induced N inputs are expected to continue to increase in the future, especially in many regions of developing countries. Because N sources vary substantially at different temporal and spatial scales and stages of economic development, it is of great importance for environmental managers to be able to simulate the dynamics of N inputs to a specific region of interest. Based on the concept of net anthropogenic N inputs (NANI), a quasi-mass-balance method, a system dynamics model simulating regional N inputs (NANI-SD) is developed and presented here for the first time. The NANI-SD model evaluates how much new N from anthropogenic activities is introduced to the whole basin, providing a simple but effective way to examine human influences on regional N cycles. Our application of the NANI-SD model to the Lake Dianchi basin in China shows that human-induced N inputs will continue to increase under current trends of development. Scenarios focused on lowering population growth rate and banning crop production were not effective in achieving long-term reductions in N inputs because their impacts were compensated by the increases in croplands and food imports, respectively. However, adjusting diet patterns and limiting livestock numbers within the basin were shown to be highly effective in controlling regional N inputs without compromising environmental sustainability of food imported regions. There was a significant trade-off between N self-sufficiency and N inputs to the region, posing the issue of 'pollution transfer' as the regions of livestock production providing animal products to the Lake Dianchi basin could suffer from locally intensified levels of N pollution introduced while producing those animal N products. The positive relationship between NANI and the proportion of animal-based protein in food indicates that reducing meat consumption could be an effective way of controlling local N inputs without sacrificing food sovereignty. NANI to the basin could also be reduced by recycling N in human and livestock wastes, but its capacity to reduce NANI is limited and projected to diminish with time. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20155301742274,,"Gao, Wei (1); Hong, Bongghi (2); Swaney, Dennis P.

J. Comput.,"Now many businesses pay more attentions on upgrading their decision-makings and adjusting their organizational structures by making full use of big data and developing information strategy for business decision supports. For group enterprises, however, multi-layered organizational structures, diversified busi-nesses, multi-regional locations along with the complexity and dynamics of strategic governance have shoul-dered the complexity in group information strategic planning and hence the difficulty in its implementations. In order to fetch a reasonable information strategy to enhance the business's ability in obtaining and integrat-ing information and reducing risks and improve the success rate of the information strategy to achieve the ul-timate goal of integrating the business information strategy with their development strategy, it is important that we approach the study from multiple aspects, multiple angles, and multiple levels to determine the infor-mation demands of the business and the strategic implementation strategy. In the first part, the paper present-ed an analysis of the situations within current information strategy in the context of the so-called 'Internet +' environment as adopted by resource enterprises. Then using the tool of big data, the researchers formulated the big data based information strategy (BDBIS) aimed at improving work efficiency and group governance. An empirical study of the DY Coal Group was then conducted and an implementation framework and proce-dure for the information strategy were suggested.

XRD and TEM data have revealed that the crystallization of NaYF4from α phase to β phase. Additionally, upconversion emissions were obtained from these Tb3+-Yb3+glass ceramics under 980 nm excitation. Compared with the cubic α-NaYF4nanocrystals of glass ceramics, the upconversion intensity augmented drastically owing to the phase transformation that the NaYF4has changed from α into β. Therefore, the PL results showed that the cubic-to-hexagonal the NaYF4:Eu3+lattice could induce a remarkable change of the PL intensity in red region (R = IED/IMD) with 393 nm excitation wavelength.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","In this work, Ag-functionalized In2O3/ZnO (IZO) nanocomposites with various contents were successfully fabricated by a nonaqueous route. The ZnO and In2O3showed separated phases and different sizes deriving from the faster growth of ZnO than In2O3using benzyl alcohol as the oxygen supplying agent. To demonstrate the usage of such Ag-functionalized IZO, the gas sensors have been fabricated and investigated for formaldehyde (HCHO) detection. The results reveal that the as-synthesized 3 wt% Ag-functionalized IZO samples exhibit high response of about 842.9 towards 2000 ppm HCHO at operating temperature of 300 °C. All sensors show rapid response and recovery. The highly sensing properties are attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the presence of these multiple functional materials, i.e. the special structure of IZO nanocomposites, the formation of the heterojunctions, the influence of Ag nanoparticles, and the mutual doping effect. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol.,"In order to investigate the effect of Ce3+concentration on the emission properties of Er3+/Yb3+codoped NaYF4nanocrystals, Ce3+/Er3+/Yb3+tri-doped NaYF4nanocrystals were prepared through a facile EDTA-assisted hydrothermal method. The upconversion (UC) and the near infrared (NIR) emission properties of Er3+ions were systematically investigated in the NaYF4:Ce3+/Er3+/Yb3+nanocrystals. Under 980 nm excitation, with the increasing of Ce3+concentration, the emission intensity of Er3+at 1550 nm (4I13/2→4I15/2) band increases initially and then decreases. The increase of the fluorescence intensity of 1550 nm is due to the energy transfer between Er3+and Ce3+ions: Er3+:4I11/2+Ce3+:2F5/2→ Er3+:4I13/2+ Ce3+:2F7/2. But when Ce3+doping concentration is 2.0%, the cross relaxation:Er3+:4I13/2+Ce3+:2F5/2→ Er3+:4I15/2+Ce3+:2F7/2happens, which depopulates the4I13/2level of Er3+and results in the decrease of the emission intensity of Er3+at 1550 nm band. Meanwhile, incorporation of Ce3+dramatically decreases the visible UC emission intensity. A possible emission mechanism was proposed.

Quat. Res.,"The Asian Monsoon, which brings ∼80% of annual precipitation to much of the Tibetan Plateau, provides runoff to major rivers across the Asian continent. Paleoclimate records indicate summer insolation and North Atlantic paleotemperature changes forced variations in monsoon rainfall through the Holocene, resulting in hydrologic and ecologic changes in plateau watersheds. We present a record of Holocene hydrologic variability in the Yarlung Tsangpo (YT) valley of the southern Tibetan Plateau, based on sedimentology and14C dating of organic-rich ‘black mats’ in paleowetlands deposits, that shows changes in wetlands extent in response to changing monsoon intensity. Four sedimentary units indicate decreasing monsoon intensity since 10.4 ka BP. Wet conditions occurred at ∼10.4 ka BP, ∼9.6 ka BP and ∼7.9–4.8 ka BP, with similar-to-modern conditions from ∼4.6–2.0 ka BP, and drier-than-modern conditions from ∼2.0 ka BP to present. Wetland changes correlate with monsoon intensity changes identified in nearby records, with weak monsoon intervals corresponding to desiccation and erosion of wetlands. Dating of in situ ceramic and microlithic artifacts within the wetlands indicates Epipaleolithic human occupation of the YT valley after 6.6 ka BP, supporting evidence for widespread colonization of the Tibetan Plateau in the early and mid-Holocene during warm, wet post-glacial conditions. © 2016 University of Washington",,20162102423914,,"Hudson, Adam M.

Chem. Eng. J.,"One-step hydroxylation of C-H (sp2) of aromatic ring synchronized with the oxidation of C-H (sp3) of side-chain of p-xylene to 2,5-dihydroxyterephathalic acid was performed using M-MCM-41 (M = Fe, Fe/Cu, Cu) as the catalysts. Cu-MCM-41 (Cu:Si = 1:100) catalyst exhibited good selectivity (73.0%) of 2,5-dihydroxyterephathalic acid and conversion (21.7%) of p-xylene using acetic acid and acetonitrile (V:V = 3:7) as the solvents at 80 °C for 5 h. The possible mechanism of the oxidation of p-xylene to 2,5-dihydroxyterephathalic acid was proposed and would guide us to design high performance catalyst for sp2and sp3C-H oxidation.

LWT,"Microbial tea products are widely welcomed for their unique quality characteristics. However, the quality characteristics of pickled tea, a microbial tea product traditionally consumed in most Asian countries remain unclear. Therefore, the quality characteristics of pickled tea processed using Camellia sinensis leaves through anaerobic solid-state fermentation were analyzed. During 60-d fermentation, the free amino acids, caffeine, and tea polyphenols in pickled tea kept much stable, the soluble sugar content showed significant and continuous decrease, but the water extract showed a continuously increasing trend. The optimal fermentation time for pickled tea was 30 d, at which its normal quality characteristics were formed: the sensory quality was the best, most free amino acids evidently increased, a high level of gallic acid was produced up to 25.7 g/kg, and volatile compounds were mainly alkanes such as heptadecane and hexadecane. It is the first report that high levels of gallic acid in a microbe-fermented tea processed by anaerobic fermentation reached to that levels in Galla chinensis, which will benefit development of a functional tea with high levels of active components and understanding the microbial transformation of tea components through anaerobic fermentation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20161602246336,,"Huang, Youyi (1); Xiao, Xiudan (2); Cong, Liu (3); Wu, Mengyao (1); Huang, Yingjie (1); Yao, Yanni (1) ","(1) Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology, State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Tea Science Dept. of Horticulture and Forestry Science College, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan City; 430070, China (2) Agriculture Department, Yiling District, Yichang City, Hubei; 443100, China (3) Pu'er Institute of Pu-erh Tea, Pu'er City, Yunnan; 665000, China ",LBWTAP,804.1 Organic Compounds - 822.3 Food Products,,,,,Amino acids - Beverages - Paraffins - Volatile organic compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Youyi(youyi@mail.hzau.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.lwt.2016.03.047,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013BAD20B06, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The authors are grateful for the financial support from Projects in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program during the Twelfth Five-year Plan Period, China (Grant No. 2013BAD20B06 ).

Beijing Ligong Daxue Xuebao,"To research the influence of explosive specific charge change on bench blasting throwing results, a similarity criteria was deduced with dimension analysis method for the bench model test based on similarity theory. Five bench models with single-row hole were prepared in a test field using cement mortar in a certain proportion. Based on these bench models, the longest throwing distance and the effective throwout rate were got from explosion experiment. The results show that, anterior fragments of blast heap are mainly derived from the middle layer of bench model. With the increase of explosive specific charge, both throwing distance and throwout rate increase accordingly and gradually tended to be stable; when q>0.51 kg/m3, the cast percentage can reach more than 40%; as 0.51 kg/m33, the cast percentage increases with explosive specific charge, and with a significant increasing rate; when q>0.63 kg/m3, the cast percentage increases with explosive specific charge, but with a smaller increasing rate. © 2016, Editorial Department of Transaction of Beijing Institute of Technology.

Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan,"The qualities of software relate to their synonym of non-functional requirements (NFRs) and mostly depend on the software processes. Based on this viewpoint, collecting process strategies from different software engineering processes and using aspect-oriented modeling, an approach to modeling NFRs-oriented software processes is proposed. The purpose of the approach is to ensure the development or evolution of high quality software through the whole life cycle of the software. First, a knowledge base of process strategies is created to store the activities for ensuring the software qualities. Based on these strategies and using aspect-oriented approach, corresponding aspects are defined to be composed into the base software process models. The need for these aspects is based primarily on the factor that the activities for NFRs and the base process models can be created separately and easily to be composed later. Besides, the conflicts between multi-aspects and between aspects and base models are detected and controlled. Second, a modeling aided tool NPAT (non-functional requirements-oriented processes aided tool) is developed to support the modeling of NFR-oriented software processes. Finally, the theory, the approach and the tool were used in a case study. Through the case study, the theory and the approach are proved to be feasible and the tool is proved to be effective. The NFRs-oriented software process modeling approach can help an organization provide a focus for enhancing software qualities by adding the NFR activities to the software processes. © 2016, Science Press.

"Proc. - Int. Conf. Digit. Home, ICDH","The two-dimensional direct Linear Discriminant Analysis (2D-DLDA) algorithm is based on the direct LDA and two-dimensional LDA. The algorithm retains the useful null space and uses the original two-dimensional image matrix directly while it does not pay much attention to the influence of the edge class and the overlap of the classes. So an improved method of 2D-DLDA is proposed in this paper. This new method redefines the between-class scatter matrix and uses the deformation of the Fisher criterion. Thus, the new method weakens the effect the edge classes have on the selection of the projection direction. Then the projection of the training samples should be calculated with some Fractional steps and the subspace would be redirected. As a result, it would avoid the serious overlap of the classes. The experiments based on the face recognition show that the new method is available. © 2016 IEEE.",,20174404328749,8039081,"Wang, Dong (1); Wang, Shunfang (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650504, China ",,723.5 Computer Applications - 921.1 Algebra - 922 Statistical Methods,130884.0,"December 2, 2016 - December 4, 2016","Guangzhou, Guangdong, China","6th International Conference on Digital Home, ICDH 2016",Computerized tomography - Digital devices - Discriminant analysis - Edge detection - Feature extraction - Matrix algebra,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shunfang(wangsf_66@hotmail.com) ",10.1109/ICDH.2016.022,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 11261068, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11661081, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is fully supported by grants fromNational Natural Science Foundation of China (11261068, 11661081).",9781509044009.0,,,"September 15, 2017",English,Face recognition,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Digital Home, ICDH 2016",16.0,58-63,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Digital Home, ICDH 2016",National Natural Science Foundation of China,A New Method of Two-Dimensional Direct LDA and Its Application in Face Recognition,,Between class scatter - Direct linear discriminant analysis - Fisher criterion - ITS applications - Null space - Projection direction - Two dimensional images - Two dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2dlda),
Dry. Technol.,"High-temperature heat treatment (HTHT) is an effective method for improving the wood dimensional stability and biological durability at present. However, the quantitative control of the wood color during the HTHT has been a more difficult problem for a long time. To solve the problem of quantitative control of wood color under the thermo-vacuum treatment (TVT) process, the mathematical model of heat and moisture transfer in alder birch wood (Betula alnoides) during the TVT process was built, and its application in the quantitative control of the wood color was also studied. (1) The experimental values and the model values of heat and moisture transfer in wood were found to be in good agreement. (2) The changes of wood temperature and moisture content (MC) were influenced obviously by the heat treatment temperature, the initial MC, and the thickness of specimen as well. The higher the heat treatment temperature was, the more rapid was the rise in the wood temperature and the drop in MC. The higher the initial MC of the wood was and the thicker the wood got, the slower the rise in wood temperature and the drop in MC. (3) Based on the mathematical model of heat and moisture transfer during the TVT process and the wood color index difference regression equations in the function of the temperature and time, the quantitative control of alder birch wood color during the TVT process was achieved. Therefore, it is feasible that heat and mass transfer principle applied during the TVT process guided the wood color quantitative control. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,20164002860437,,"Yang, Yan (1, 2); Lu, Jianxiong (1); Dong, Chunlei (2); Zhan, Tianyi (1); Jiang, Jinghui (1); Luo, Bei (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Tree Genetics and Breeding, Research Institute of Wood Industry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing, China (2) College of Material Engineering, South West Forestry University, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",DRTEDQ,537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 641.3 Mass Transfer - 731.3 Specific Variables Control - 741.1 Light/Optics - 811.2 Wood and Wood Products - 921 Mathematics - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements,,,,,Color - Colorimetry - Drops - Functions - Heat treatment - High temperature operations - Mass transfer - Mathematical models - Moisture control,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lu, Jianxiong(jianxiong@caf.ac.cn) ",10.1080/07373937.2015.1137308,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15322300,,,,07373937,13,"October 2, 2016",English,Wood,,44.0,1567-1582,,2016,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Drying Technology,,Mathematical model of heat and moisture transfer in alder birch wood during the thermo-vacuum treatment and its application in the quantitative control of the wood color,,Betula alnoides - Experimental validations - Heat and moisture transfer - lightness difference - Total color difference - Vacuum treatment,34
Ore Geol. Rev.,"The Dapingzhang volcanogenic Cu-Pb-Zn sulfide deposit is located in the Lancangjiang tectonic zone within the Sanjiang region, Yunnan province of southwestern China. The deposit occurs within a felsic volcanic dome belonging to a mid-Silurian volcanic belt stretching for more than 100km from Dapingzhang to Sandashan. The mineralized volcanic rocks are predominantly keratophyre and quartz keratophyre with subordinate spilite. The Dapingzhang deposit is characterized by well-developed vertical zonation with stockwork ores in the bottom, disseminated sulfide ores in the middle, and massive sulfide ores in the top, overlain by a thin layer of chemical sedimentary exhalative rocks (chert and barite). The Re-Os age of the pyrites from the deposit is 417±23Ma, indistinguishable from the age of the associated felsic volcanic rocks. The associated felsic volcanic rocks are characterized by negative Nb-Ta anomalies and positive ΕNd(t) values (+4.4-+6.5), similar to the coeval calc-alkaline volcanic rocks in the region. This observation supports the interpretation that the felsic volcanic rocks associated with the Dapingzhang deposit are the derivatives of arc basaltic magma by extensive fractional crystallization. The δ34S values of the sulfides from the deposit vary from -1.24 to +4.32‰, indicating a predominantly magmatic source for the sulfur. The sulfides are also characterized by homogeneous and relatively low radiogenic Pb isotope compositions (206Pb/204Pb=18.310-18.656,207Pb/204Pb=15.489-15.643 and208Pb/204Pb=37.811-38.662), similar to the Pb isotopic compositions of the associated volcanic rocks. The Pb isotopic data indicate that mantle-derived Pb is more prevalent than crust-derived Pb in the deposit. The S-Pb isotopic data indicate that the important ore-forming materials were mainly derived from the associated volcanic rocks. The δ13CPDBand δ18OSMOWvalues of the associated hydrothermal calcite crystals vary from -2.3‰ to +0.27‰ and from +14.6 to +24.4‰, respectively. These values are between the mantle and marine carbonate values. The narrow range of the δ13CPDBvalues for the calcite indicates that carbon-bearing species in the hydrothermal fluids were primarily derived from marine carbonates. The δ18O values for the hydrothermal fluids, calculated from the measured values for quartz, are between -2.1‰ and +3.5‰. The corresponding δD values for the fluids range from -59‰ to -84‰. The O-H isotopic data indicate mixing between magmatic fluids and seawater in the ore-forming hydrothermal system. Similar to a typical volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit, the ore-forming fluids contained both magmatic fluids and heated seawater; the ore metals and regents were derived from the underlying magma as well as felsic country rocks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20160401840105,,"Zhu, Wei-Guang (1); Zhong, Hong (1); Yang, Yi-Jin (1, 2); Ren, Tao (1, 3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 99 West Lincheng Road, Guiyang; 550081, China (2) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (3) Faculty of Land Resources Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",,"471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 484 Seismology - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 543.4 Tantalum and Alloys - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",,,,,Alkalinity - Binary alloys - Calcite - Cobalt deposits - Copper compounds - Copper lead zinc deposits - Deposits - Economic geology - Isotopes - Lead compounds - Lead zinc deposits - Neodymium alloys - Niobium alloys - Pyrites - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Seawater - Sedimentary rocks - Sedimentology - Sulfur compounds - Tantalum alloys - Ternary alloys - Volcanoes - Zinc sulfide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhong, Hong(zhonghong@vip.gyig.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2015.12.011,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: KZZD-EW-TZ-20, Acronym: -, Sponsor: CAS-SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams; Number: 2009CB421003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41273049, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: SKLOG-ZY125-06, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This study was financially supported by the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2009CB421003 ), the CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams (Intraplate Mineralization Research Team; KZZD-EW-TZ-20 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41273049 ), and the State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry (12th Five-Year Plan: SKLOG-ZY125-06 ).

"IEEE Glob. Commun. Conf., GLOBECOM - Proc.","The tsunami of video services brings huge pressure on communication systems, especially on some bandwidth-limited scenarios like wireless networks. Represented by H.264, current video compression approaches can save the transmission bandwidth by reducing the intra- and inter-frame redundancy. However, the huge amount of video content redundancy (VCR) in the transmission is still existing. In this paper, we propose a novel Content-Slimming System (CSS) framework based on the convergence of Computing, Communication and Cache to avoid the transmission of VCRs. The main idea of CSS is to detect VCRs, generate VCR models and clip them from the original frames by Computing, then transmit the necessary video content and semantic difference description by Communication, finally reconstruct the full video based on the received video content, semantic difference description and VCR models stored by Cache. Moreover, we also investigate the Video Monitoring application based on the CSS framework (CSS-VM) in which the background of monitoring frames is modeled, detected and sheared to reduce the transmission bandwidth consumption. The simulation results show that the bandwidth consumption of CSS-VM can be reduced at least by half compared to H.264, while the video quality and visual experience of CSS-VM are even better. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171203471814,7842374,"Liu, Chang (1, 2, 3); Tian, Lin (1, 2); Zhou, Yiqing (1, 2, 3); Shi, Jinglin (1, 2); Liu, Jiyuan (4); He, Songlin (4); Pu, Yuanyuan (4); Wang, Xingce (5) ","(1) Beijing Key Laboratory of Mobile Computing and Pervasive Device, Beijing; 100190, China (2) Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100190, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (4) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (5) Department of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing; 100875, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.4 Television Systems and Equipment - 717.1 Optical Communication Systems,126373.0,"December 4, 2016 - December 8, 2016","Washington, DC, United states","59th IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2016",Bandwidth - Bandwidth compression - Image compression - Redundancy - Semantics - Video recording - Visual communication - Wave transmission,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tian, Lin(tianlindd@ict.ac.cn) ",10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842374,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 2015000021223ZK31, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Beijing Municipal Excellent Talents Foundation; Number: 61431001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.61431001) and Beijing Talents fund (2015000021223ZK31),9781509013289.0,,,2016,English,Videocassette recorders,"2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2016 - Proceedings",30.0,,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2016 - Proceedings",AT and T; et al.; Huawei; Intel; National Instruments; Qualcomm,"Video content redundancy elimination based on the convergence of computing, communication and cache",,Bandwidth consumption - Bandwidth limiteds - Compression approach - Interframe redundancy - Redundancy elimination - Semantic difference - Transmission bandwidth - Visual experiences,

The impact experiment was then carried out on the artificial jointed rock specimens with the help of an SHPB test apparatus (50 mm). Rock dynamic mechanics properties that are affected by the joint filling material were then acquired. It is found that with the strength of the filling material reduced, the joint specimen quantitative dynamic elastic modulus decreases and the dynamic compressive strength attenuates with an index form. The specimens filled with soft material showed plastic deformation and failure, the overall failure pattern of specimens associated with filling material properties. Reflection energy ratio showed an increased trend as the strength of the specimens decreased. Transmission energy ratio reduced. The energy dissipation ratio was associated with the filling material properties.

This paper measures the discrepancies of medical service among different areas by using Theil Index Analysis, and finds that the total difference of basic health service among east, middle, west and south areas decrease gradually. However, the equity of health institutions and hospital beds is significantly better than health workers. Through Theil Index composition analysis, we find that in aspects of health institutes and health workers, the key element for the inequality of health institutions is the imbalance within middle area, however, for the hospital beds inequity, the main factor is the inequality between areas.

Rock Soil Mech,"Tailings is the main filling material for mines, which belongs to the typical loose medium and has obvious compressibility under the action of external force and its gravity. Its physical mechanical properties will change with the compaction conditions, but there is no reasonable calculation method to predict these properties of the tailings so far. The tailings of Dahongshan copper mine are used as an example in this study, where a mathematical relationship between density of the tailings and the load which meets the characteristics of the power function is obtained employing a user-defined function in original software that is fitted with the results of the high pressure consolidation test. The mathematical relationship between density of the tailings filling body of a large goaf and the height which meets characteristics of the power function is derived by analyzing the vertical forces balanced of the unit volume of the tailings, the function is integrable, it can be known form the function, density of the tailings increases with the height, the growth rate decreases gradually.

J. Iron Steel Res. Int.,"Thermodynamic analysis of refractory siderite ore during carbothermic reduction was conducted. Microstructure characteristics and phase transformation of siderite ore during sodium-carbonate-added catalyzing carbothermic reduction were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays were used to characterize the reduced samples. Results indicate that the solid reaction between FeO and SiO2is inevitable during carbothermic reduction and the formation of fayalite is the main hindrance to the rapid reduction of siderite. The phase transformation of present siderite ore can be described as: siderite-magnetite-metallic iron, complying with the formation of abundant fayalite. Improving the reduction temperature (≤ 1050 °C) and duration is helpful for the formation and aggregation of metallic iron. The iron particle size in the reduced ore was below 20 μm, and fayalite was abundant in the absence of sodium carbonate. With 5% Na2CO3addition, the iron particle size in the reduced ore was generally above 50 μm, and the diffraction intensity associated with metallic iron in the XRD pattern increased. The Na2O formed from the dissociation of Na2CO3can catalyze the carbothermic reduction of the siderite. This catalytic activity may be mainly caused by an increase in the reducing reaction activity of FeO. © 2016 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute",,20164803075939,,"BAI, Shao-jun (1, 2); WU, Meng (2); LÜ, Ghao (2); WEN, Shu-ming (1, 2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",,545.1 Iron - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 812.2 Refractories - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Carbonation - Carbothermal reduction - Catalyst activity - Iron - Iron ores - Iron oxides - Magnetite - Microstructure - Ore analysis - Particle size - Phase transitions - Refractory materials - Scanning electron microscopy - Silica - Sodium bicarbonate - Sodium Carbonate - Thermoanalysis - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","WEN, Shu-ming(shmwen@126.com) ",10.1016/S1006-706X(16)30136-4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22103988,,,,1006706X,9,"January 1, 2017",English,Ore reduction,,19.0,891-899,,2016,Gangtie Yanjiu Xuebao,Journal of Iron and Steel Research International,,Microstructure Characteristic and Phase Evolution of Refractory Siderite Ore during Sodium-carbonate-added Catalyzing Carbothermic Reduction,,catalyzing - Diffraction intensity - Energy dispersive analysis of X-rays - Microstructure characteristics - Phase evolutions - Reducing reactions - Reduction temperatures - Thermo dynamic analysis,23
RSC Adv.,"Semiconductor tin oxide (SnO2) is acknowledged to be one of the semiconductor oxides with most potential for utilization as nitrogen dioxide (NO2)-sensor materials. However, the challenge to improve the gas sensitivity still remains, and this limits the full realization of the SnO2sensor potential. In this paper, enhanced gas sensitivity obtained by the formation of a SnO2/niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) hybrid structure is reported. As the NO2concentration is lower to 3 ppm, the measured resistance in the SnO2/Nb2O5-based sensor is still 2.5 times larger than that in a pristine SnO2-based sensor. With an increase in the NO2concentration, the response time of the SnO2/Nb2O5-based sensor decreases sharply whereas the pristine SnO2-based sensor response time increases. The enhanced performance is attributed to the presence of more oxygen vacancies and a higher specific surface area in the hybrid structure induced by the introduction of Nb2O5. These results provide some general guidelines for the selection of compositions to enhance the sensor performance. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20164603025530,,"Sun, Qi (1); Diao, Kaidi (2); Sun, Tulai (3); Li, Maozhong (4); Cui, Xudong (2); Tian, He (3); Xiang, Bin (1) ","(1) Department of Materials Science & Engineering, CAS Key Lab. of Materials for Energy Conversion, Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; Anhui; 230026, China (2) Science and Technology on Plasma Physics Laboratory, Research Center of Laser Fusion, CAEP, Sichuan; 621900, China (3) Center of Electron Microscopy, State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (4) Yunnan KIRO-CH Photonics Co., Ltd., No. 5 Hongwai Road, Economic and Technological Development Zone, Kunming, China ",RSCACL,712.1.2 Compound Semiconducting Materials - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Gas sensing electrodes - Niobium oxide - Nitrogen oxides - Oxygen vacancies - Tin dioxide - Tin oxides,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cui, Xudong(xudcui@163.com) ",10.1039/c6ra21672b,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 11474249, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11434009, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21373196, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: WK2060140014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: WK2340000050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21373196, 11434009, 11474249), the National Program for Thousand Young Talents of China and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WK2340000050, WK2060140014).",,,107,2016,English,Semiconducting tin compounds,,28.0,105317-105321,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Enhanced gas-sensing performance of SnO2/Nb2O5hybrid nanowires,,Gas sensitivity - Hybrid nanowires - Hybrid structure - Nitrogen dioxides - Semiconductor oxides - Sensor materials - Sensor performance - Sensor response time,6
RSC Adv.,"Solution processable high-performance, large-area, low-cost infrared organic photodetectors (OPDs) have been receiving more and more attention for their important applications both in scientific and technological fields. The search for a simple method to upgrade device performance for OPDs becomes increasingly important. Here, the performance of an OPD in the near-infrared (NIR) region is tremendously improved by doping iodine into the device's active layer (P3HT:PCBM:I2), 2.7 wt% iodine doping may increase the absorption by 31.3% for the active film and result in a ∼11000-fold increase in responsivity for the detector. A high detectivity (D∗) of ∼1.6 × 1012cm Hz1/2W-1, a good specific responsivity (R) of ∼80 A W-1and a large EQE (external quantum efficiency) of 120% are achieved under illumination (λ = 850 nm) at room temperature. Systematic characterizations reveal that iodine-doping can introduce acceptor states in the energy band gap for the polymer layer, and thus increase the harvesting to long wavelength photons. A small dose of iodine doping can significantly induce improvement in device performance. This work demonstrates a simple but feasible method to enhance an NIR optoelectronics device. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,20162202441669,,"Tian, Pin (1); Tang, Libin (1, 2); Xiang, Jinzhong (1); Sun, Zhenhua (3); Ji, Rongbin (2); Lai, Sin Ki (4); Ping Lau, Shu (4); Kong, Jincheng (2); Zhao, Jun (2); Yang, Chunzhang (2); Li, Yanhui (2) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Kunming Institute of Physics, Kunming; 650223, China (3) College of Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen; 518000, China (4) Department of Applied Physics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong ",RSCACL,712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Energy gap - Infrared devices - Iodine - Photodetectors - Photons,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Libin(scitang@163.com) ",10.1039/c6ra02773c,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 2012FA003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 61106098, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61106098), and the Key Project of Applied Basic Research of Yunnan Province, China (No. 2012FA003).",,,51,2016,English,Semiconductor doping,,54.0,45166-45171,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Solution processable high-performance infrared organic photodetector by iodine doping,,Acceptor state - Device performance - External quantum efficiency - Long-wavelength photons - Near infrared region - Optoelectronics devices - Organic photodetector - Solution processable,6
Lect. Notes Inst. Comput. Sci. Soc. Informatics Telecommun. Eng.,"This paper proposes neighborhood-based approach for QoSprediction of cloud services by taking advantages of collaborative intelligence. Different from heuristic collaborative filtering and matrixfactorization, we set a formal neighborhood-based prediction framework which allows an efficient global optimization scheme, and then exploits different baseline estimate components to improve predictive performance. To validate our methods, a large-scale QoS-specific dataset which consists of invocation records from 339 service users on 5,825 web services on a world-scale distributed network is used. Experimental results show that the learned neighborhood-based models can overcome existing difficulties of heuristic collaborative filtering methods and achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art prediction methods. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2016.",,20160801960249,,"Wu, Hao (1); He, Jun (2); Li, Bo (1); Pei, Yijian (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing; 210044, China ",,723.3 Database Systems - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.5 Optimization Techniques,163659.0,"November 10, 2015 - November 11, 2015","Wuhan, China","11th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications, and Worksharing, CollaborateCom 2015",Collaborative filtering - Distributed database systems - Forecasting - Global optimization - Heuristic methods,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Hao(haowu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-28910-6_10,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale School of Medicine; Number: XT412011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program; Number: 2013FB009,2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 61562090,61562092,61472345, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the Special Funds for Middle-aged and Young Core Instructor Training Program of Yunnan University, the Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province (2013FB009,2014FA023), the Program for Innovative Research Team in Yunnan University (XT412011), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61562090,61562092,61472345).",9783319289090.0,18678211,,2016,English,Web services,"Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications, and Worksharing - 11th International Conference, CollaborateCom 2015, Proceedings",18.0,106-117,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",,Personalized QoS prediction of cloud services via learning neighborhood-based model,,Cloud services - Collaborative filtering methods - Distributed networks - Efficient global optimization - Neighborhood model - Parameter learning - Predictive performance - Qos predictions,163
"Proc. - Int. Conf. Netw. Inf. Syst. Comput., ICNISC","In the existing works, a Kalman filter with recursive covariance estimation (KF-RCE) was proposed by Bo Feng et al. to sequentially estimating process noise covariance matrix. However, there may be a singular matrix existed in the KF-RCE algorithm, which would lead to unreasonable system state estimation in the system initial stage. In this paper, a threshold-based Kalman filter with recursive covariance estimation (TBKF-RCE), which uses a threshold-based switch scheme, is presented to suppress the singularity phenomenon brought by the singularity matrix in KF-RCE algorithm. Simulation results have shown that the singularity phenomenon which happened in the system initial stage has been weakened by using the TBKF-RCE algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.",,20172803938318,7946005,"Lv, Xiaojun (1); Sun, Pingyin (2); Jia, Xinchun (3); Li, Jianyu (1) ","(1) Institute of Computing Technologies, China Academy of Railway Sciences, Beijing, China (2) Construction Headquarters of South of Yunnan, Kunming Railway Administration, Kunming, China (3) School of Mathematical Sciences, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China ",,703.2 Electric Filters - 731.1 Control Systems - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 921 Mathematics,128301.0,"April 15, 2016 - April 17, 2016","Wuhan, China","2016 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers, ICNISC 2016",Bandpass filters - Computer networks - Covariance matrix - Information systems - Information use - State estimation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICNISC.2016.50,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: U1334210, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U1334210.,9781467388382.0,,,"July 2, 2016",English,Kalman filters,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers, ICNISC 2016",11.0,332-336,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers, ICNISC 2016",,A threshold-based Kalman filter with recursive covariance estimation,,Covariance estimation - Process noise - Singular matrices - Singularity matrix,
Superlattices Microstruct,"Arsenene is the monolayer gray arsenic which was proposed only recently. Herein, we study the magnetic properties and electronic structures of transition-metal-doped arsenene by using first-principles calculations. Three doping concentrations are considered in our investigation. The results show that not all 3d transition metal (TM) atoms can induce the magnetic state in arsenene. Moreover, the doping concentration hardly affects the magnetic moment except for Fe- and Ni-doped systems. We believe, in particular, that the magnetism is dominantly controlled by the doping TM atoms, and no significant contributions are induced, even by their nearest arsenic atoms. In addition, the multiplicate electronic structures of TM-doped arsenene, such as semiconductor, metal and half-metal, have also been revealed and discussed in this work, which may provide a new attention for the doped arsenene nanosheets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20164603017346,,"Liu, Mingyang (1); Chen, Qingyuan (1); Huang, Yang (1); Cao, Chao (2); He, Yao (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou; 310036, China ",SUMIEK,531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921 Mathematics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Arsenic - Atoms - Calculations - Electronic structure - Magnetic moments - Magnetic properties - Semiconductor doping,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","He, Yao(yhe@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.spmi.2016.09.014,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10963677,"Number: 2013FB007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2011CI003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013HA019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: NCET-12-1080, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 61366007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11164032, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61066005, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61366007 and No. 11164032 and No. 61066005 ), Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (Grant No. NCET-12-1080 ), Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2011CI003 and No. 2013FB007 ), Program of high-end scientific and technological talents in Yunnan Province (Grant NO. 2013HA019 ), Program for Excellent Young Talents in Yunnan University.

Polym. Bull.,"Well-defined poly(styrene-block-n-butyl acrylate) pentablock copolymers were synthesized via RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer) emulsion polymerization with the combination of using a carefully designed amphiphilic macroRAFT at the nucleation stage and the pre-emulsion technology at the growth stage. The multiblock copolymers were produced within seven hours with narrow latex particle size distribution, high solid content and good latex stability. The thermal stability, thermal processability, microphase separation and mechanical properties of multiblock copolymers as well as corresponding random and blending (co)polymers were also investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) instrument, Haake torque rheometer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), tensile and impact tests, respectively. The TG results revealed the multiblock copolymer has a good thermal stability with the initial decomposition temperature higher than 350 °C. Rheological results demonstrated that the multiblock copolymers have higher torque values than corresponding random and blending (co)polymers. DSC and SEM analysis denoted that there exists phase separation of multiblock and blending (co)polymers. For multiblock copolymer, the impact strength increased by 27.39 % to 7. 44 kJ m−2with the composition of 60 wt% of styrene units and 40 wt% of n-butyl acrylate units. The tensile strength of multiblock copolymer increased with the increase of styrene composition. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20155001672274,,"Fu, Xiaowei (1); Hu, Kai (1); Kong, Weibo (1); Bao, Lixia (1); Wang, Jiliang (2); Lei, Jingxin (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610065, China (2) School of Chemistry Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, 650091, Kunming, China ",POBUDR,641.1 Thermodynamics - 801 Chemistry - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.2 Polymerization - 944.6 Temperature Measurements - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Blending - Differential scanning calorimetry - Emulsion polymerization - Free radical polymerization - Impact strength - Latexes - Mechanical properties - Microphase separation - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Phase separation - Scanning electron microscopy - Styrene - Tensile strength - Thermodynamic stability - Thermogravimetric analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lei, Jingxin(jxlei@scu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s00289-015-1569-z,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,01700839,6,"June 1, 2016",English,Emulsification,,42.0,1649-1671,,2016,Springer Verlag,Polymer Bulletin,,Synthesis and characterization of poly(styrene-block-n-butyl acrylate) pentablock copolymer via RAFT emulsion polymerization mediated by amphiphilic macroRAFT agent combined with pre-emulsion technology,,Emulsion technology - Impact performance - Initial decomposition temperatures - Macro-RAFT agent - Multiblock co-polymers - Pentablock copolymers - Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer - Synthesis and characterizations,73
Forests,"Subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest (EBLF) is a widespread vegetation type throughout East Asia that has suffered extensive deforestation and fragmentation. Selection and successful propagation of native tree species are important for improving ecological restoration of these forests. We carried out a series of experiments to study the propagation requirements of indigenous subtropical tree species in Southwest China. Seeds of 21 tree species collected from the natural forest were materials for the experiment. This paper examines the seed germination and seedling growth performance of these species in a nursery environment. Germination percentages ranged from 41% to 96% and were >50% for 19 species. The median length of germination time (MLG) ranged from 24 days for Padus wilsonii to 144 days for Ilex polyneura. Fifteen species can reach the transplant size (>15 cm in height) within 12 months of seed collection. Nursery-grown seedlings for each species were planted in degraded site. Two years after planting, the seedling survival rate was > 50% in 18 species and > 80% in 12 species. Based on these results, 17 species were recommended as appropriate species for nursery production in forest restoration projects. Our study contributes additional knowledge regarding the propagation techniques for various native subtropical tree species in nurseries for forest restoration. © 2016 by the authors.",Open Access,20160701919545,,"Lu, Yang (1, 2, 3); Ranjitkar, Sailesh (2); Xu, Jian-Chu (2); Ou, Xiao-Kun (1); Zhou, Ying-Zai (5); Ye, Jian-Fang (5); Wu, Xun-Feng (6); Weyerhaeuser, Horst (7); He, Jun (2, 4, 8) ","(1) Institute of Ecology and Geobotany, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Key Laboratory for Plant Diversity and Biogeography of East Asia, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650201, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (4) World Agroforestry Center, ICRAF East and Central Asia, Kunming; 650201, China (5) Tengchong Gaoligong Nature Reserve Management Department, Tengchong; 679100, China (6) Yunnan Vocational College of Forestry, Kunming; 650000, China (7) Mountain Societies Research Centre, University of Central Asia, Bishkek; 720001, Kyrgyzstan (8) College of Economics and Management, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650204, China ",,443 Meteorology - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products,,,,,Conservation - Cultivation - Deforestation - Restoration - Tropics - Wave propagation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","He, Jun(h.jun@cgiar.org) ",10.3390/f7010012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19994907,"Number: 335-031-1015Z, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Darwin College, University of Cambridge; Number: CRP 6, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31270524, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We acknowledge the financial support from Darwin Initiatives, MISSEORS (335-031-1015Z), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31270524).

Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"Occlusion poses as a critical challenge in computer vision for a long time. Camera array based synthetic aperture photography has been regarded as a promising way to address the problem of occluded object imaging. However, the application of this technique is limited by the building cost and the immobility of the camera array system. In order to build a more practical synthetic aperture photography system, in this paper, a novel multiple moving camera based collaborative synthetic aperture photography is proposed. The main characteristics of our work include: (1) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first multiple moving camera based collaborative synthetic aperture photography system; (2) by building a sparse 3D map of the occluded scene using one camera, the information from the subsequent cameras can be incrementally utilized to estimate the warping induced by the focal plane; (3) the compatibility of different types of cameras, such as the hand-held action cameras or the quadrotor on-board cameras, shows the generality of the proposed framework. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the see-throughocclusion performance of the proposed approach in different scenarios. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2016.",,20170303266537,,"Zhang, Xiaoqiang (1); Zhang, Yanning (1); Yang, Tao (1); Li, Zhi (1); Tao, Dapeng (2) ","(1) School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an; Shaanxi, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 742.2 Photographic Equipment - 746 Imaging Techniques,188019.0,"October 19, 2016 - October 19, 2016","Beijing, China","4th Chinese Conference on Intelligent Visual Surveillance, IVS 2016",Cameras - Photography,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Xiaoqiang(vantasy@mail.nwpu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-981-10-3476-3_1,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: G2015KY0301, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20160229172932237, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 1 3GH014604, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 3102015AX007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61272288, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61301192, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61303123, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61672429, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61231016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported the National Natural Science Foundation of China(No. 61272288, No. 61301192, No. 61303123, No. 61672429, No. 61231016 (Key Project)), NPU New People and New Directions Foundation (No.1 3GH014604), The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 3102015AX007), NPU New Ao Xiang Star (No. G2015KY0301), and Shen Zhen Science and Technology Foundation (JCYJ20160229172932237).",9789811034756.0,18650929,,2016,English,Synthetic apertures,"Intelligent Visual Surveillance - 4th Chinese Conference, IVS 2016, Proceedings",13.0,3-11,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing; Institute of Automation,Occluded object imaging based on collaborative synthetic aperture photography,,Building costs - Camera arrays - Critical challenges - Focal Plane - Moving cameras - Occluded objects - Onboard camera - Quad rotors,664 CCIS
Food Chem.,"A simple and rapid magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) based dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction (D-μ-SPE) method coupled with HPLC-DAD has been proposed for simultaneous determination of three estrogens (17β-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1) and diethylstilbestrol (DES)) in pork samples. In this paper, the synthesis of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-coated Fe3O4@caprylic acid NPs as an efficient sorbent for its high surface area, excellent adsorption capacity, good dispersion ability and high super-paramagnetic property was successfully applied to adsorb estrogens. Vortex was used to enhance mass transfer rate as it provided mild and effective mixing of sample solution and increased the contact between analytes and MNPs. The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were investigated in detail. The dosages of sorbent and eluate are 100 μL and 500 μL, respectively. The extraction equilibrium was achieved within 2 min and the MNPs can be reused. The proposed technique provided high recoveries (93.3-106.7%), good linearity (0.9993-0.9999), low LODs (0.021-0.033 ng mL-1) and repeatability (RSD% = 1.87-2.92). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Anal. Chem.,"Artemisinin, extracted from Artemisia annua, and its derivatives are important frontline antimalarials. To produce specific antibodies for the detection and quantification of artemisinin, artemisinin was transformed to 9-hydroxyartemisinin by microbial fermentation, which was used to prepare a 9-succinate artemisinin hapten for conjugation with ovalbumin. A monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated as 3H7A10, was selected from hybridoma cell lines which showed high specificity to artemisinin. No competitive inhibition was observed with artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, and artemether for up to 20,000 ng mL-1. An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) was developed, which showed a concentration causing 50% of inhibition (IC50) for artemisinin as 2.6 ng mL-1and a working range of 0.6-11.5 ng mL-1. The icELISA was applied for the quantification of artemisinin in crude extracts of wild A. annua and the study of pharmacokinetics of artemisinin in rat serum after intraperitoneal injection. The results were highly correlated with those determined by HPLC-UV analysis (R2= 0.9919). In comparison with reported antiartemisinin mAbs which have broad cross-reactivity with other artemisinin derivatives, the high specificity of 3H7A10 for artemisinin will enable development of methods for quantification of artemisinin in Artemisia plants and antimalarial drugs such as Arco and for pharmacokinetic studies. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,20161002079158,,"Guo, Suqin (1); Cui, Yongliang (1); Wang, Kunbi (2); Zhang, Wei (1); Tan, Guiyu (1); Wang, Baomin (1); Cui, Liwang (3) ","(1) College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing; 100193, China (2) College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650201, China (3) Department of Entomology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park; PA; 16802, United States ",ANCHAM,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 801 Chemistry,,,,,Body fluids - Cell culture - Chemical detection - Monoclonal antibodies - Pharmacokinetics - Rats,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Baomin(wbaomin@263.net) ",10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04058,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15206882,"Number: U19AI089672, Acronym: NIH, Sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Number: -, Acronym: NIAID, Sponsor: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ","This research was supported by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (U19AI089672).",,00032700,5,"March 1, 2016",English,Enzyme inhibition,,40.0,2701-2706,,2016,American Chemical Society,Analytical Chemistry,,Development of a Specific Monoclonal Antibody for the Quantification of Artemisinin in Artemisia annua and Rat Serum,,Competitive inhibition - Detection and quantifications - Dihydroartemisinin - Indirect competitive enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays - Intraperitoneal injections - Microbial fermentation - Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) - Pharmacokinetic studies,88
Steel Res. Int.,"The enhanced reduction of coal-containing titanomagnetite concentrates (TC) briquette with a three-layer bed are investigated using a electric furnace containing three heating zones under argon atmosphere, simulating the heating regime similar to those that exist in an actual RHF. It is found that the reduction rate of the briquette on the top layer is greatly higher than that on the middle and bottom layers for a three-layer bed reduction. It is impossible that the whole bed reaches complete reduction without reoxidation of reduced briquettes of top layer. It is observed that bigger briquettes on the top layer decreased the reduction rates of briquettes on the lower layers due to the more shielding of radiation. Ferrosilicon (Fe-Si) is used for increasing the reduction rate of the briquettes on the lower layers, which is found to be accelerated. The whole bed simultaneously reaches a high metallization degree with a shorter reduction time. It is revealed that using a multi-layer bed of TC-coal composite briquettes in RHF could be achieved by accelerating the reduction rates of briquettes with appropriate amount of Fe-Si addition for different lower layers. The reduction of coal-containing titanomagnetite concentrates briquette with a three-layer bed is enhanced by adding ferrosilicon to briquettes in the lower layers, resulting in that the whole bed simultaneously reaches a high metallization degree with a shorter reduction time. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Based on parameter estimation of the Heston model obtained by minimizing the mean square deviation between the theoretical and empirical return distributions, we simulate mean residence time of positive return (MRTPR). Plots of MRTPR against the amplitude or mean reversion of volatility demonstrate a phenomenon of herd behavior for a positive cross correlation between noise sources of the Heston model. Also, for a negative cross correlation, a phenomenon of herd behavior is observed in plots of MRTPR against the long-run variance by increasing amplitude or mean reversion of volatility. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162802573555,,"Li, Jiang-Cheng (1, 2); Li, Yun-Xian (1, 2); Tang, Nian-Sheng (1); Mei, Dong-Cheng (3) ","(1) Department of Statistics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Finance, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (3) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",PHYADX,922.1 Probability Theory - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Behavioral research - Commerce - Financial markets,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Nian-Sheng(nstang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.physa.2016.06.061,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 11165016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015M572507, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","This work was supported by the grants from the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (Grant No.: 11225103), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 11165016), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No.: 2015M572507), and the Science Foundation of Yunnan University (Grant No.: 2009A001Z) and the Scientific Research Innovation Team of Yunnan Province (No. 2015HC028).",,03784371,,"November 15, 2016",English,Residence time distribution,,70.0,350-357,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,,The roles of mean residence time on herd behavior in a financial market,,Cross correlations - Econophysicss - Herd behaviors - Heston model - Long-run variance - Mean residence time - Mean square deviation - Negative cross-correlation,462

To address this challenging, many attention have been paid to this issue. The foggy image generally contains the sky and non-sky regions while the pixel values in this two distinguished regions is different. The dark channel prior algorithm has been considered as one effective dehazing method which only uses one constant factor for the overall image regardless of the scene pattern. This imprudent procedure results in more darkness image color and fails to accomplish excellent results. In this paper we propose one adaptive factor-based approach to improving dark channel prior dehazing.

This method can extract facial features under different resolutions and fuse facial features in various structures to enhance the information content of the features. Specifically, first, the image is decomposed into three kinds of resolutions with different scales to form the multi-resolution image sequences, with Gabor wavelets used to extract the facial features of each image. Second, PCA is applied to reduce the dimension of the obtained high dimensional features. Third, every two or three features of the multi-resolution images are fused in various structures after they are extracted in three different scales respectively. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method is utilized to train one of the most discriminative classifier after the features of dimensionality reduction are obtained.

Environ. Pollut.,"Steroid estrogen in natural waters may be biodegraded by quinone-reducing bacteria, dissolved organic matter (DOM) may serve as a terminal electron acceptor in this process. The influence of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and light illumination on the reduction efficiency of anthraquinone-2-disulfonate (AQS) was investigated using 17β-estradiol (E2) as the target species. The optimum reduction conditions were found to be in the dark under anaerobic conditions at pH 8.0 and 30 °C. Quinone-reducing bacteria can use the quinone structure of DOM components as a terminal electron acceptor coupling with microbial growth to promote biodegradation. Compared with other DOM models, AQS best stimulated E2 biodegradation and the mediating effect was improved as the AQS concentration increased from 0 to 0.5 mM. However, further increase had an inhibiting effect. Natural DOM containing lake humic acid (LHA) and lake fulvic acid (LFA) had a very important accelerating effect on the degradation of E2, the action mechanism of which was consistent with that defined using DOM models. The natural DOM contained more aromatic compounds, demonstrating their greater electron-accepting capacity and generally more effective support for microorganism growth and E2 oxidation than Aldrich humic acid (HA). These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of microbial degradation of steroid estrogens in anaerobic environments and confirm DOM as an important terminal electron acceptor in pollutant transformation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20163402727521,,"Gu, Lipeng (1); Huang, Bin (1); Xu, Zhixiang (1); Ma, Xiaodong (1); Pan, Xuejun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",ENPOEK,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.8 Biotechnology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Aromatic compounds - Bacteria - Biodegradation - Biogeochemistry - Dissolution - Dissolved oxygen - Electrons - Ketones - Lakes - Organic acids,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Bin(huangbin@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.envpol.2016.08.028,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18736424,"Number: 2014T70887, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 41401558, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This project was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41401558 ) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant no. 2014T70887 ).,,02697491,,"November 1, 2016",English,Biological materials,,37.0,26-33,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Environmental Pollution,,Dissolved organic matter as a terminal electron acceptor in the microbial oxidation of steroid estrogen,,Anaerobic environment - Dissolved organic matters - Electron acceptor - Microbial degradation - Microorganism growth - Quinone - Reduction conditions - Terminal electron acceptors,218
Energy Convers. Manage.,"High concentrating photovoltaic is one of the most promising photovoltaic techniques that possesses up to now the highest photo to electric conversion efficiency. However, due to the small tolerance in the misfit angle between the incoming solar light and the normal of the solar cell panel, an accurate solar tracking is necessary in order to maintain the high performance. Although increasing the tracking frequency in conventional solar tracking strategy enhances the tracking accuracy, it also increases the moving frequency of the tracking system and the mechanical wear. In order to overcome this limitation, a more efficient solar tracking strategy has been provided by utilizing an open-loop mode to actively control and alter the tracking frequency instead of using constant tracking frequency. The code for controlling of tracking frequency is pre-programmed according to the theoretical solar velocity in different time and date. By correlating the movement from the azimuth and the altitude freedom, the total moving frequency of the solar tracking system has been reduced. As a result, it effectively decreases the moving frequency of the tracking system, which saves the required external energy to drive the tracking system and improves its reliability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ore Geol. Rev.,"The Beiya gold deposit is located in the central part of the Jinshajiang-Honghe strike-slip belt, at the junction zone of the Tethys-Himalaya orogenic belt and the Yangtze plate in SW China. This large-scale (125.6 million. metric. tonnes with a mean grade of 2.42 g/t) Au-rich polymetallic deposit is related to alkaline porphyry intrusions. Previous studies show that the Beiya alkaline porphyry intrusions are the fractionation product of a mantle-derived magma emplaced in an extension environment at the post-collision stage of the India-Eurasian plate collision; the Beiya deposit is considered to be skarn-related. Based on detailed field studies and previous work, we propose that the Beiya porphyry and associated Au-rich polymetallic ores were formed by the emplacement of magmas within the Jinshajiang-Honghe strike-slip fault during the late stage of the India-Eurasian plate collision at 45-25 Ma. At Beiya, the mineralized zones in the Cu-Au-rich porphyries are surrounded by Au-Cu-Fe skarns and Au (Cu) veins. Pb-Zn-Ag-rich mineralization was derived from the inner porphyry, and is widely developed outside the central alkaline-rich porphyry. The sulfur isotope signature of the sulfide mineralization in the Beiya and Qinhe deposits is -2.40‰-4.50‰ and 1.25-2.75‰, respectively. These values are close to 0‰, indicating that the sulfur may be mantle-derived. The δ18O compositions of the ore-forming fluids responsible for the formation of calcites at Qinhe are 8.10‰-9.61‰, which is lower than that of Beiya (δ18O=10.5‰) where the ores contain a larger contribution of oxygen from the mantle. The Beiya porphyry magmas provided fluids and the heat that drove the transport of the metals to the site of deposition. Alkaline porphyries are widely distributed throughout the Jinshajiang-Honghe strike-slip fault belt, and they are potential hosts to future discoveries of Beiya-style mineralization. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20151900835724,,"Li, Wen-Chang (1, 2); Wang, Jian-Hua (1); He, Zhong-Hua (3); Dou, Song (4) ","(1) Faculty of Land and Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Geological Survey, Kunming; 650051, China (3) Yunnan Gold and Minerals Group Co.

ECS J. Solid State Sci. Technol.,"Yb3+/Er3+co-doped K2LuF5micro-crystals have been synthesized via a facile and environmentally-friendly hydrothermal route. The effects of Ce3+on the upconversion (UC) and downconversion (DC) luminescence properties of K2LuF5: 16%Yb3+, 2%Er3+under the excitation of 980 nm laser diode (LD) are systematically investigated. The emission intensity located at 1.54 μm of 15 mol% Ce3+doped sample is enhanced about 6 times, in comparison with that of Ce3+-free sample. It is proposed that the efficient cross-relaxation processes between Er3+and Ce3+ions contribute to the competition between UC and DC transitions, and the success in varying the UC and DC radiation rate. In addition, with an increasing of excitation power density, the cross-relaxation process of Ce3+ions doped samples is promoted, which leads to a multicolor output. This study could be expected to promote the development of Ce3+doped K2LuF5: 16%Yb3+, 2%Er3+as micro-optical device. © 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

In this paper, we take HSV color space as an example, H component is clustered by adaptive simplified PCNN (S-PCNN), and then the H component is fused according to oscillation frequency graph (OFG) of S-PCNN; at the same time, S and V components are decomposed by NSST, and different fusion rules are utilized to fuse the obtained results. Finally, inverse HSV transform is performed to get the RGB color image.

Mater. Trans.,"According to the microstructure characteristics of sandwich (AFS) panels, two-dimensional random models of AFS panels with different porosities were created by C++ and ANSYS/LS-DYNA software in this paper. The main purpose of the current paper is investigating and analyzing the effects of porosity on the compression behaviors and energy absorption capacities of AFS panels under the same compressive loading on base of established random models. It was found that there were obvious three stages in the stress-strain curves of AFS panels, namely elastic region, collapse region and densification region. In addition, the results also confirmed that porosity had apparent effect on the compressive capacities and energy absorption capacities of AFS panels.

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"In a linear regression model with nonignorable missing covariates, non-normal errors or outliers can lead to badly biased and misleading results with standard parameter estimation methods built on either least squares- or likelihood-based methods. A propensity score method with a robust and efficient regression procedure called composite quantile regression for parameter estimation of the linear regression model with nonignorable missing covariates is proposed. Semiparametric estimation of the propensity score is based on the exponentially tilted likelihood approach. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are systematically investigated. The proposed method is resistant to heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the response. Simulation studies and real data applications are used to illustrate its potential impacts and benefits compared with conventional methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.",,20153501225504,,"Jiang, Depeng (1); Zhao, Puying (1); Tang, Niansheng (2) ","(1) Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Canada (2) Department of Statistics, Yunnan University, China ",CSDADW,921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Least squares approximations - Linear regression - Statistics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jiang, Depeng(depeng.jiang@umanitoba.ca) ",10.1016/j.csda.2015.07.017,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,01679473,,"March 2, 2016",English,Parameter estimation,,30.0,98-119,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Computational Statistics and Data Analysis,,A propensity score adjustment method for regression models with nonignorable missing covariates,,Asymptotic properties - Exponentially tilted likelihood - Linear regression models - Missing at randoms - Parameter estimation method - Propensity score - Quantile regression - Semi parametric estimation,94
Res Chem Intermed,"Fe3O4/graphene magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized and used as adsorbents for the dispersive solid-phase extraction of copper and lead in Panax notoginseng. The properties of the nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effects of parameters like the adsorbent amount, pH, adsorption time, mutual ion interferences, desorption solution and reusability of the adsorbent for the recovery of trace elements were examined. Copper and lead were then quantified using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limits for copper and lead were 0.22 and 0.87 μg L−1, respectively. Repeatability (within 1 day) and reproducibility (between days) of the method were less than 2.2 and 4.8 %, respectively.

Phys. Status Solidi A Appl. Mater. Sci.,"For solution-based small-molecule organic photovoltaic cells (SM BHJ), thermal annealing is often regarded as a very vital processing to yield high-efficiency devices. Here, the device with the photoactive p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC60BM blends has been studied by varying the annealing temperature. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE), fill factor (FF), and short-circuit current (Jsc) has been achieved after the device was annealed at the temperature of 80 C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) displayed that the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2tends to form big islands with well-defined crystalline structure (long coherence length) surrounded by small islands of the PC60BM after annealing, and reached the largest grain size of 27 nm after annealing at 80 C. AFM images demonstrated the most sufficient phase separation within the photoactive blend layer after annealing at 80 C, which provides good photogenerated excitons dissociation. Such improvements have proved beneficial to decrease the ohmic loss and recombination in carrier-transport process via measuring series resistance and shunt resistance as well as hole mobility. This work opens up a new way to understand the relationship between thermal annealing and molecular interaction from the viewpoint of lattice relaxation. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"A novel sensitive fluorescent sensor for determination of sterigmatocystin (ST), which was based on carbon dots-embedded molecularly imprinted polymer (CDs@MIP), was prepared by an efficient one-pot reaction. First, highly blue luminescent CDs were synthesized via a one-step reaction. Then, through a non-hydrolytic sol-gel process, MIP was formed on the CDs surface in the presence of 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone as an alternative template molecule to obtain CDs@MIP. The CDs acted as antennas for signal amplification and optical readout, and the MIP coated on the CDs surface provided specific binding sites for ST. The performance of CDs@MIP was compared with that of CDs embedded in non-imprinted polymer (CDs@NIP). CDs@MIP exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity toward ST. Under optimized conditions, the relative fluorescence intensity of CDs@MIP decreased linearly with the concentration of ST from 0.05 to 2.0mgL-1with a detection limit of 0.019mgL-1(S/N=3) and the precision for five replicate detections of 0.10mgL-1ST was 2.31%.

Geosphere,"Desert environment modeling involving sand dune migration is important for better understanding of Earth and planetary surface processes. This paper presents a geographic information system (GIS) add-in for automated measurement of dune migration directions and migration rates using multitemporal, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data or other sources. Using the angle of repose (AOR) as a sensitive movement indicator of barchan (crescent-shaped) and transverse dunes, an add-in toolbar for ArcGIS was developed using the Python programming language to automatically detect, measure, and store dune migration direction and migration rate at random point locations on dune slip face centerlines. Pseudo-code and application samples from the White Sands dune field in New Mexico, USA, are also presented. The free add-in can be used by the geoscience community for studying coastal and desert sand dunes. © 2016 The Authors.",Open Access,20163202691804,,"Xia, Jisheng (1); Dong, Pinliang (2, 3) ","(1) School of Resource, Environment and Earth Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Imaging Technology, Capital Normal University and Key Laboratory of 3D Information Acquisition and Application, Ministry of Education of China, Beijing; 100048, China (3) Department of Geography and the Environment, University of North Texas, 1155 Union Circle, #305279, Denton; TX; 76203, United States ",,405.3 Surveying - 481.1 Geology - 481.1.1 Geomorphology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use,,,,,Digital instruments - Geographic information systems - Geomorphology - Landforms - Optical radar - Sand,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Dong, Pinliang(pdong@unt.edu) ",10.1130/GES01329.1,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1553040X,"Number: OFSLRSS201607, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: http://dx.doi.org/10.5069/G97D2S2D, Acronym: EAR, Sponsor: Division of Earth Sciences; Number: EAR-1043051, Acronym: EAR, Sponsor: Division of Earth Sciences; Number: 41461103, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquisition and processing were completed by the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM, http://www.ncalm.org).

Parallel Distrib. Comput. Appl. Technol. PDCAT Proc.,"How to resist combined geometric attacks effectively while maintain a high embedding capacity is still a challenging task for the digital watermarking research. An affine correction based algorithm is proposed in this paper, which can resist combined geometric attacks and keep a higher watermark embedding capacity. The SURF algorithm and the RANSAC algorithm are used to extract, match and select feature points from the attacked image and the original image. Then, the least square algorithm is used to estimate the affine matrix of the geometric attacks according to the relationship between the matched feature points. The attacks are corrected based on the estimated affine matrix. A fine correction step is included to improve the precision of the watermark detection. To resist the cropping attacks, the watermark information is encoded with LT-coding. The encoded watermark is embedded in the DWT-DCT composite domain of the image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only has a high embedding capacity, but also is robust to many kinds of geometric attacks. © 2016 IEEE.",,20172803929578,7943351,"Zhang, Wuyong (1); Chen, Jianhua (1); Wang, Rongshu (1); Wang, Xiaolong (1); Meng, Tian (1) ","(1) School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra,128266.0,"December 16, 2016 - December 18, 2016","Guangzhou, China","17th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies, PDCAT 2016",Digital watermarking - Distributed computer systems - Image watermarking - Matrix algebra - Robustness (control systems),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/PDCAT.2016.046,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61062005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.61062005),9781509050819.0,,,"July 2, 2016",English,Geometry,"Proceedings - 17th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies, PDCAT 2016",23.0,167-172,1 of 1,2016,IEEE Computer Society,"Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies, PDCAT Proceedings",IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Parallel Processing; Sun Yat-Sen University,Affine correction based image watermarking robust to geometric attacks,,Affine matrices - Embedding capacity - Least square algorithms - LT codes - Surf algorithms - Watermark detection - Watermark embedding - Watermark information,0
Nonlinear Anal. Hybrid Syst.,"This paper addresses the problem of the delay-dependent stability and H∞ performance for neutral systems with uncertain Markovian jump; the uncertainty of Markovian jump refers to the partial information on transition probability. In order to highlight the methods for the analysis of the systems, the neutral delay is assumed same as discrete delay. By the novel constructed Lyapunov functional, combining with the delay decomposition technique and free matrices, and using the new inequality rather than the Jensen inequality, the delay-dependent stability conditions are firstly obtained for the two kinds of neutral dynamical systems. Based on the stability condition, the H∞ performance result for the systems with Markovian jump is secondly provided. All of the delay-dependent stabilization results are formulated in terms of LMIs, which can be easily checked by the LMI control toolbox in Matlab. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the validity and potential of the developed criteria. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,20153501221214,,"Xiong, Lianglin (1, 2); Zhang, Haiyang (2); Li, Yongkun (1); Liu, Zixin (3) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China (3) School of Mathematics and Statistics, GuiZhou University of Finance and Economics, Guiyang; 550025, China ",,921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Dynamical systems - Linear matrix inequalities - Lyapunov functions - Markov processes - Stabilization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xiong, Lianglin(lianglin_5318@126.com) ",10.1016/j.nahs.2015.07.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,1751570X,,"February 01, 2016",English,System stability,,47.0,13-25,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Nonlinear Analysis: Hybrid Systems,,Improved stability and H∞ performance for neutral systems with uncertain Markovian jump,,Delay decompositions - Delay-dependent stability - Delay-dependent stability condition - Delay-dependent stabilization - Integral inequalities - Markovian jump systems - Partial information on transition probabilities - Partly unknown transition probabilities,19
Astron. Astrophys.,"Context. A discrepancy exists between the abundance of ammonia (NH3) derived previously for the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of IRC+10216 from far-IR submillimeter rotational lines and that inferred from radio inversion or mid-infrared (MIR) absorption transitions. Aims. To address the discrepancy described above, new high-resolution far-infrared (FIR) observations of both ortho- and para-NH3transitions toward IRC+10216 were obtained with Herschel, with the goal of determining the ammonia abundance and constraining the distribution of NH3in the envelope of IRC+10216. Methods. We used the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) on board Herschel to observe all rotational transitions up to the J = 3 level (three ortho- and six para-NH3lines). We conducted non-LTE multilevel radiative transfer modelling, including the effects of near-infrared (NIR) radiative pumping through vibrational transitions. The computed emission line profiles are compared with the new HIFI data, the radio inversion transitions, and the MIR absorption lines in the ν2band taken from the literature. Results. We found that NIR pumping is of key importance for understanding the excitation of rotational levels of NH3. The derived NH3abundances relative to molecular hydrogen were (2.8 ± 0.5) × 10-8for ortho-NH3and for para-NH3, consistent with an ortho/para ratio of 1. These values are in a rough agreement with abundances derived from the inversion transitions, as well as with the total abundance of NH3inferred from the MIR absorption lines. To explain the observed rotational transitions, ammonia must be formed near to the central star at a radius close to the end of the wind acceleration region, but no larger than about 20 stellar radii (1σ confidence level). © ESO, 2016.",Open Access,20163402726463,A131,"Schmidt, M.R.

RSC Adv.,"The aim of this study was to explore the anti-diabetic effects of cucurbitane-type triterpenoids, mogroside V (MV) and its aglycone mogrol (MO), both isolated from the fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle, and to investigate the pharmacokinetic behaviors of MV and its metabolite MO in rats. The anti-diabetic effects by activating AMPK of MV and MO were evaluated in this study. Furthermore, a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous quantification of MV and its metabolite MO in rat plasma has been developed and validated. The assay has been successfully used for pharmacokinetic evaluation of MV and its metabolite MO after intravenous and oral administration of a single dose of MV in rats at 2.0 mg kg-1and 5.0 mg kg-1, respectively. In vitro activities indicated that MV and its aglycone MO were both potent AMPK activators. MV and MO could activate the AMPK heterotrimer α2β1γ1 by 2.4 and 2.3 fold with an EC50of 20.4 and 4.2 μM, respectively. This result suggested AMPK activation by MV and MO was proved to contribute at least partially to the anti-diabetic properties of S. grosvenorii. The pharmacokinetic results showed that MV was rapidly deglycosylated and metabolized into MO, and both of these were determined after intravenous administration of 2.0 mg kg-1of MV in rats. MV was not detected in rat plasma after oral administration, whereas a trace amount of MO was found. The oral absolute bioavailability (F) of MV was estimated to be 8.73 ± 1.46% and the elimination half-life (t1/2) of metabolite MO in rats was 2.46 ± 0.19 h. It was indicated that MV showed poor absorption and/or strong metabolism in vivo. Its metabolite MO may be the main pharmacological activity form after oral administration of MV in rats. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20162802582173,,"Luo, Zuliang (1); Qiu, Feng (2); Zhang, Kailun (1); Qin, Xijun (1); Guo, Yuhua (1); Shi, Hongwu (1); Zhang, Lixia (3); Zhang, Zhonglian (3); Ma, Xiaojun (1, 3) ","(1) Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing; 100193, China (2) Beijing Key Lab of TCM Collateral Disease Theory Research, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Capital Medical University, Beijing; 100069, China (3) Yunnan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinghong; 530023, China ",RSCACL,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821.4 Agricultural Products,,,,,Biochemistry - Biomolecules - Body fluids - Chemical activation - Electrospray ionization - Fruits - Liquid chromatography - Mass spectrometry - Metabolites - Pharmacokinetics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ma, Xiaojun(mayixuan10@163.com) ",10.1039/c5ra23275a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: -, Acronym: SJTU, Sponsor: Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 81373914, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81573521, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: IT1306, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; ","Financial support for this work from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81373914 and No. 81573521) and Program for Innovative Research Team in IMPLAD (No. IT1306) is gratefully acknowledged.

J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci.,"We attempted to use the GARCH-vine copula model to analyze the dependent structure among FV (fruit and vegetable) exports, FV imports, GDP of China, exchange rate and crude oil spot price. The empirical results show that the volatility of WTI has short-run persistence and long-run persistence in the volatility of five series. The AIC of the Clayton dependence is larger than that of the student-t dependence, which means that the student-t dependence structure exhibits better explanatory capabilities than the Clayton dependence structure. In the D-vine copula, there is a greater probability of extreme values in FV exports, FV imports, GDP of China. In the C-vine copula, there is greater probability of extreme values between FV exports and GDP of China. We also find significant relationship between FV exports and FV imports, FV exports and GDP of China, FV exports and exchange rates, respectively. The Clayton copula can catch left tail dependence; therefore, FV exports plays a pivotal role in economic growth, there existed a widely held belief in the role of the government via its expanded FV exports policies in fostering the economic growth of the country.

J. Mater. Civ. Eng.,"Extensive studies have focused on the beneficial use of coal fly ashes (CFAs) as a partial replacement for cement in concretes or mortars, in the effort of reducing the environmental footprint and embodied energy of concrete materials while removing CFAs from the waste stream. In this study, a pure fly ash paste (PFAP) was developed in place of ordinary portland cement paste (OPCP). This PFAP was prepared at room temperature and without direct alkali activation, unlike geopolymer or other fly-ash-based cementitious materials that need to be cured at a relatively high temperature or activated by alkalis. The samples were prepared using only the as-received class C coal fly ash, water, and a very small amount of borax (Na2B4O7). On average, the PFAP featured 28-day compressive strength of about 36 MPa, and micro-nano hardness and elastic modulus 29% and 5% higher than the OPCP, respectively. The PFAP also featured 15% lower gas permeability, 27% higher Cl-diffusivity, 20% lower dry density, and considerably higher surface resistivity and bulk resistivity. These mechanical, durability, and other properties of the PFAP make it a viable environmentally friendly (green) construction binder suitable for a host of structural and nonstructural applications. Advanced characterization of the raw material and PFAP pastes was employed to elucidate the hydration mechanisms of this green binder. While this work only showcases the properties of one specific CFA, the obtained knowledge sheds light on the role of class C CFAs in the hydration process and may benefit the expanded use of various CFAs in cementitious materials. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,20160801992274,04015138,"Xie, Ning (1); Shi, Xianming (2); Dang, Yudong (3); Pace, Alexandra (1) ","(1) Western Transportation Institute and Dept. of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, Montana State Univ., 2327 University way #6, Bozeman; MT; 59717-4250, United States (2) Laboratory of Advanced and Sustainable Cementitious Materials, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State Univ., Sloan 101, P.O.

Front. Environ. Sci. Eng.,"A sampling campaign including summer, autumn and winter of 2014 and spring of 2015 was accomplished to obtain the characteristic of chemical components in PM2.5at three sites of Kunming, a plateau city in South-west China. Nine kinds of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSI), organic and element carbon (OC and EC) in PM2.5were analyzed by ion chromatography and thermal optical reflectance method, respectively. Results showed that the average concentrations of total WSI, OC and EC were 22.85±10.95 µg·m-3, 17.83±9.57 µg·m-3and 5.11±4.29 µg·m-3, respectively. They totally accounted for 53.0% of PM2.5. Secondary organic and inorganic aerosols (SOA and SIA) were also assessed by the minimum ratio of OC/EC, nitrogen and sulfur oxidation ratios.

However, secondary pollution in the plateau city should also not be ignorable, due to the appropriate temperature and strong solar radiation, which can promote the atmospheric photochemical reactions.

Electrochim Acta,"Exploration of efficient platinum alloy counter electrodes (CEs) and understanding their electrocatalytic mechanism toward I3-reduction reaction have been two arising objectives for high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here we demonstrate the experimental realization of bimetallic PtM (M = Pd, Ag) alloy nanotube (NT) CE electrocatalysts by an one-step templated synthesis for efficient DSSCs. The preliminary results demonstrate that the alloying of Pt with Pd or Ag for high surface-to-volume CE can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity in comparison with pristine Pt electrode. The promising electrocatalytic performances of the PtM CEs are mainly attributed to the good matching of their work functions to redox potential of I-/I3-couples and electron-enriched alloy surface. When fabricated into liquid-junction DSSCs, the impressive power conversion efficiencies up to 8.09% and 7.34% are determined for the cells with PtPd and PtAg NTs, yielding cell efficiencies enhancements of 18.4% and 5.9% in comparison with 6.93% for pristine Pt based DSSC, respectively. Moreover, the long-term stabilities are also increased due to competitive reactions between Pd/Ag and liquid electrolyte, protecting the Pt atoms from being dissolved by redox electrolyte. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Revista Tecnica de la Facultad de Ingenieria Universidad del Zulia,"As it stands, modern concrete projects tend to become large and ultra-large. Meanwhile, the engineering environment is increasingly complicated, which puts forward higher requirements for the properties of concrete materials. The development of high performance concrete has become a research focus and direction of concrete material science and engineering technology in the new period. The application of nanotechnology in the concrete field can break through the limitations of traditional concrete. It is of great significance for the improvement of concrete properties and may promote the sustainable development of cement industry. Carbon nanofiber concrete is a new type of building material. However, there are few domestic studies in this aspect. For this end, with physical and mechanical properties of carbon nanofiber concrete as the research object, this paper explores measures to improve the mechanical properties of carbon nanofiber concrete.

J Alloys Compd,"The octahedral Fe3O4(magnetite) nanoparticles were electrochemically grown on self-supported buckypaper and characterized by XRD, SEM, Raman and TGA. It could be used as a kind of metallic current collector-free anode for lithium ion battery, which would significantly reduce the mass of the whole anode by 66%. The new flexible Fe3O4/buckypaper composite anode achieves a higher initial reversible capacity of 1120 mAh g-1and exhibits more stable performance compared with Fe3O4anode coated on Cu foil by traditional electrode-fabrication technique. This is due to that the flexible 3D porous-structured Fe3O4/buckypaper composite is light weight and can accommodate the volume change of Fe3O4during the lithiation/delithiation process, and promotes the diffusion and transfer of lithium ion and electron, respectively. Moreover, this buckypaper/Fe3O4composite anode displays excellent rate capability, which maintains a discharge specific capacity of 210 mAh g-1when the applied current rate is 10 °C and still delivers 1150 mAh g-1after returning to 0.2 °C.

Annealing experiments of CoMoB(30nm) film and CoMoB(10nm)/Cu(40nm)/CoMoB(30nm)/SiO2/Si multi-films were carried out in the temperature range from 400C to 700C. Failure temperature and mechanism of Cu diffusion in CoMoB film were discussed. The composition, sheet resistance and morphology of the film were investigated by X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD), Four Point Probe (FPP) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), respectively. It can be concluded that the failure temperature of CoMoB film is 600C.

Dizhen Dizhi,"According to continuous waveform recorded by three seismic stations (BAX, MDS, TQU) in the epicentral area of the Lushan earthquake, the paper studied the spatial and temporal variations of the relative velocity of the earth's crust during April 20, 2012 to April 20, 2014. The distance of the stations from the epicenter is about 15.7 km, 20.5 km, 29.6 km, respectively. Results show that the relative velocity of the earth's crust significantly decreased after the earthquake at the three stations from autocorrelation Green's function at 0.1-1 Hz frequency range. The largest velocity drop is about 0.6% at station BAX on the northwest of the epicenter, the second largest drop is at station MDS on the southeast of the epicenter, which is about 0.4%, and the minimum velocity drop is measured at seismic station TQU, about 0.2%, with a depth sensitivity range of about 10 km. In space, the relative velocity changes have good consistency with the characteristics of source rupture and coseismic volume strain changes. The maximum velocity drop appeared in 40 to 100 days after the earthquake, respectively; the recovery process of relative velocity shows a better correspondence with decay of aftershocks. The results support that the temporal change of seismic velocity may be related to the damage from fault rupture and stress change around the fault zone. For higher frequencies (2-5 Hz), there are no obvious coseismic velocity changes in all three stations, but seasonal variations are observed, especially the semi-annual variation, with an average maximum change rate of about 0.3%. The depth sensitivity range of the change is about 1 km. However, it does not have good corresponding relation with the near-surface damage caused by strong ground motion. © 2016, Editorial Office of Seismology and Geology.

J. Ambient Intell. Humanized Comput.,"Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is an emerging technology which can offer a wide variety of promising applications, such as safety-related and infotainment applications. However, VANET also raises important security and privacy concerns that must be properly addressed for widespread deployment. In this paper, we first proposed a provable secure pseudonym-based cryptosystem with a trusted authority, including a pseudonym-based encryption scheme, a pseudonym-based multi-receiver encryption scheme, a pseudonym-based signature scheme, and a pseudonym-based one-pass key establishment protocol. We then presented a secure and efficient data access scheme for VANET based on cooperative caching technology and the proposed pseudonym-based cryptosystem. The efficiency of data access was greatly improved by allowing the sharing and coordination of cached data among multiple vehicles, and the anonymity of vehicles, data confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation were guaranteed by employing the proposed pseudonym-based cryptosystem. Simulation results have shown that the proposed data access scheme is suitable to the VANET environment. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20160501873928,,"Wang, Changji (1, 2); Shi, Dongyuan (2); Xu, Xilei (2); Fang, Jian (2) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,,Cryptography,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Changji(wchangji@gmail.com) ",10.1007/s12652-015-0301-z,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18685145,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Foundation for Innovative Research Team of Jimei University; Number: 2015SE203, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61173189, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper is jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61173189), the Foundation for Innovative Research Team of Yunnan University, Guangdong Province Information Security Key Laboratory Project, Yunnan Province Software Engineering Key Laboratory Project (Grant No. 2015SE203).",,18685137,1,"February 1, 2016",English,Vehicular ad hoc networks,,22.0,63-71,,2016,Springer Verlag,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,,An anonymous data access scheme for VANET using pseudonym-based cryptography,,Cooperative caching - Data confidentiality - Emerging technologies - Key establishment protocol - Multi-receiver encryption - Onion packet - Security and privacy - Trusted authorities,7

Appl. Energy,"To improve heat transfer performance of the gas heater in the supercritical CO2Rankine cycle, heat transfer characteristics of supercritical CO2heated in Internally Ribbed Tubes (IRT) was experimentally and numerically investigated over a wide range of buoyancy effect. Experiments reveal that for IRT with a geometric parameter of β = 109, serious local heat transfer deterioration did not occur and buoyancy consistently improved heat transfer. IRT showed far superior performance over smooth tubes. Empirical Nusselt correlations were recommended for both upward and downward flows. A numerical model was then developed and verified against experimental data from IRT with different geometries. Further numerical studies on 7 different IRT demonstrate that buoyancy effect relates closely to rib geometries. For IRT with β = 0.48-4, heat transfer to supercritical CO2in upward flow was impaired when Bo is around 10-4, though the impairment became weaker as β increased. When β reached 16, buoyancy-induced impairment disappeared and Nusselt number increased gradually as buoyancy became stronger. Further increase in β up to 109 didn't lead to obvious heat transfer enhancement of supercritical CO2, indicating that rib geometries play a smaller role in heat transfer than buoyancy for IRT with β > 16. Finally, design strategy for IRT was provided for the optimization of gas heaters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20162502525858,,"Li, Zhouhang (1, 2); Tang, Guoli (3); Wu, Yuxin (3); Zhai, Yuling (1, 2); Xu, Jianxin (1, 2); Wang, Hua (1, 2); Lu, Junfu (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing; 100084, China ",APENDX,"522 Gas Fuels - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921 Mathematics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Buoyancy - Carbon dioxide - Gas heating - Geometry - Heat transfer - Heat transfer coefficients - Rankine cycle,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhouhang(lizh@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.018,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2015HA019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 10978169, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 10978193, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: CNMRCUTS1506, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Financial support from State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization ( CNMRCUTS1506 ), the Recruitment Program of High-level Talents, Kunming University of Science and Technology (Nos. 10978169 and 10978193 ) and Scientific and Technological leading Talent Projects in Yunnan Province (No. 2015HA019 ) is acknowledged.",,03062619,,"September 15, 2016",English,Heat convection,,72.0,126-141,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Applied Energy,,Improved gas heaters for supercritical CO2Rankine cycles: Considerations on forced and mixed convection heat transfer enhancement,,Buoyancy effect - Gas heaters - Internally ribbed tube - Rib geometry - Supercritical CO2,178
Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"The interaction between 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied with fluorescence quenching technique and ultra-violet absorption spectroscopy. The results indicated that PPT led to the intrinsic fluorescence quenching of BSA through a static quenching process. The binding constants of PPT with BSA obtained with fluorescence quenching method were calculated as 0.9263×103(298 K), 0.618 2×103(308 K), 0.4144×103L·mol-1(318 K), respectively; while the number binding sites n were close to unity. The results showed that the driving force of the interaction between PPT and BSA was hydrogen bond and Van der Waals force.

J. Chromatogr. B Anal. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci.,"Alstonia scholaris has been used in “Dai” ethnic medicine to treat chronic respiratory diseases for a long history, and the major bioactive constituents are alkaloids. An alkaloidal extract of A. scholaris leaves (AAS) has been developed into an investigational new drug, and has been approved for phase I/II clinical trials by China Food and Drug Administration. However, little is known on the chemical composition and in vivo metabolism of AAS, thus far. In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/qTOF-MS) method was established to characterize the chemical constituents of AAS. Samples were separated on an ACQUITY UPLC CSH column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) with acetonitrile and water containing 0.3% formic acid as the mobile phase. On the basis of high-accuracy mass spectral analysis, a total of 35 alkaloids were characterized from AAS, including 11 scholaricine-type, 9 vallesamine-type, 12 picrinine-type, and 3 tubotaiwine-type alkaloids. Furthermore, the metabolic pathways of 4 representative alkaloids in rats were studied. They mainly undertook hydroxylation and glucuronidation reactions. Based on the above metabolic pathways, the metabolism of AAS (10 mg/kg) in rats after oral administration was studied by LC/MS. A total of 33 compounds in plasma, 40 compounds in urine, and 38 compounds in feces were characterized. The results indicated that scholaricine-type alkaloids could get into circulation more readily than the other types. This is the first systematic study on chemical profiling and metabolites identification of AAS. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20153401195340,,"Cao, Jing (1); Shen, Hong-Mei (3); Wang, Qi (1); Qian, Yi (1); Guo, Hong-Cheng (1); Li, Kai (1); Qiao, Xue (1); Guo, De-An (1); Luo, Xiao-Dong (2); Ye, Min (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, 38 Xueyuan Road, Beijing; 100191, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650204, China (3) The Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650106, China ",JCBAAI,461.9 Biology - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Alkaloids - Atomic absorption spectrometry - Biomolecules - High performance liquid chromatography - Mass spectrometry - Metabolism - Physiology - Rats - Spectrum analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Luo, Xiao-Dong(xdluo@kib.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.044,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1873376X,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Changjiang Scholar Program of Chinese Ministry of Education; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 81222054, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81222054 ), and the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University from Chinese Ministry of Education (No. NCET-11-0019).

Ecohydrology,"The seasonal water use and stand-level transpiration of the important tropical timber tree family, Dipterocarpaceae, have not been well investigated. Here, we characterized the seasonal water use and stand-level transpiration of eight, evergreen, dipterocarps in tropical Southwest China in the 2013 wet and dry seasons: six species grown in monoculture and two species in mixture. We estimated stand-level transpiration using a power model, combining data from 22 trees of all species measured in the two seasons. Despite significant decreases in soil volumetric water content within 1-m depth, predawn leaf water potentials (> −0.5 MPa) of all trees indicated access of roots to water. Daily sap flux density (SFDd) of all species closely responded to vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Dry season VPD increased by 29%, compared to in wet season, resulting 27–52% increased SFDdin six of the eight species. Whole tree daily water use was scaled with diameter at 1.3 m height for the 22 trees (r2= 0.91 and 0.93 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively). Daily mean stand-level transpiration ranged from 0.63 to 2.23 mm d−1(mean = 1.05) and from 1.18 to 2.29 mm d−1(mean = 1.63) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Our results reveal conservative water use of dipterocarps and increased transpiration in dry season when a stable soil water source is available. In comparison with introduced fast-growing timber species, such as Eucalyptus and Acacia mangium, dipterocarp trees and forests consume much less water, making them more suitable as plantation timber crops for the region.

Inf Sci,"This study considers the practical phenomena in the process of preference elicitation and proposes an asymmetric sigmoid numerical scale (ASNS) based on a generalized sigmoid function. It also offers proof of the scale's asymmetry, variability, consistency, and diminishing utility properties. Further, this study introduces the hesitant fuzzy preference format and defines the hesitant fuzzy continuous preference term. Based on this approach, the asymmetric hesitant fuzzy sigmoid preference relation (AHSPR) is developed and used in the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results show that the AHSPR is a general and optimal preference relation. Additionally, this study constructs a discrete fitting technology and an approximate translation method as the applied bases of the new scale and the preference relation. Following this, a model framework of the AHSPR in the AHP is provided. Finally, this study re-examines a well-known numerical example in order to demonstrate the application and advantages of the proposed numerical scale, the preference format, and the modeling framework. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,20162102411304,,"Zhou, Wei (1, 2); Xu, Zeshui (2) ","(1) International Business School, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (2) Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610064, China ",ISIJBC,961 Systems Science,,,,,Hierarchical systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Zeshui(xuzeshui@263.net) ",10.1016/j.ins.2016.04.003,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2015M570792, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 13YJC630247, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 71561026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61273209, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71301141, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71571123, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive suggestions that have led to this improved version of the paper.

Chem. Eur. J.,"Chemoselectivities of five experimentally realised CpRuCl(PPh3)2/MeI-catalysed couplings of 7-azabenzo-norbornadienes with selected alkynes were successfully resolved from multiple reaction pathway models. Density functional theory calculations showed the following mechanistic succession to be energetically plausible: (1) CpRuI catalyst activation; (2) formation of crucial metallacyclopentene intermediate; (3) cyclobutene product (P2) elimination (ΔGRel(RDS)≈11.9–17.6 kcal mol−1). Alternative formation of dihydrobenzoindole products (P1) by isomerisation to azametalla-cyclohexene followed by subsequent CpRuI release was much less favourable (ΔGRel(RDS)≈26.5–29.8 kcal mol−1). Emergent stereoselectivities were in close agreement with experimental results for reactions a, b, e. Consequent investigations employing dispersion corrections similarly support the empirical findings of P1 dominating in reactions c and d through P2→P1 product transformations as being probable (ΔG≈25.3–30.1 kcal mol−1). © 2016 The Authors.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Inf. Autom., ICIA","Human action recognition has been an active research topic for its wide application. Most researches focus on the recognition based on one single modality sensor. In this paper, we present a novel approach for human action recognition, which is based on fusing triaxial acceleration signals and depth maps. We extract Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coefficients from acceleration signals and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features from Depth Motion Maps (DMM). After obtaining these two feature vectors, we concatenate them and adopt Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to reduce the feature dimension. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed approach, we construct a multimodal dataset named SIAT Activity of Daily Living (ADL). Experimental results on our dataset SIAT ADL show that the proposed approach is more discriminative and robust than the single feature-based method. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171203484724,7832012,"Li, Yi (1, 2); Cheng, Jun (1, 3); Feng, Wei (1, 3); Tao, Dapeng (4) ","(1) Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Robotics and Intelligent System, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (2) Shenzhen College of Advanced Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (3) Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong (4) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, China ",,921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,126277.0,"August 1, 2016 - August 3, 2016","Ningbo, China","2016 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation, IEEE ICIA 2016",Fast Fourier transforms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICInfA.2016.7832012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,"We would like to thank all our warmly cooperative volunteers.

J. Clean. Prod.,"It is often difficult to determine the effects of policies at a sectoral level in the overlapping domains of pollution control and energy conservation, making it difficult to consider co-benefits of energy conservation and air pollution reduction and tensions. In China, the industry sector contributes much more carbon and pollution emissions than other sectors. In this paper, Baoshan District (BSD), one of the most important industrial zones in the Shanghai metropolis, is used as a case study to illustrate the situation and to provide information to assess the effectiveness of environmental sustainable development policies in industries. The policies resulting from China's Eleventh Five-year Plan (FYP) are considered at the level of BSD. In particular, the result of implementing local policies of air pollution control and energy are analysed at BSD. Three indicator systems are adopted for quantitatively and qualitatively evaluating energy saving and air pollution reduction achieved by technical, structural and management measures in industrial enterprises of BSD. Analysis made in the paper shows that the co-benefits of pollution cutting and energy conservation have been achieved at certain scopes and degrees in the industry sector in BSD, e.g. SO2and Particulate Matter (PM) were reduced by 35.1% and 7.7% respectively, and the energy density was cut by 26.7%. Due to existing barriers of the lack of co-planning and co-operations in the process of designing and implementing the policies, and the overlooking the leakage of emissions in the whole project area, the overall co-benefits cannot be achieved effectively in BSD. Recommendations are made for future detailed studies of this or similar districts to develop an indicator system of co-benefits to help demonstrate the advantages of joint planning and policies for co-benefits. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,20153601237931,,"Jiang, Ping (1); Xu, Bin (2); Geng, Yong (3); Dong, Wenbo (1); Chen, Yihui (4); Xue, Bing (5) ","(1) Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan Tyndall Centre, Fudan University, Shanghai; 200433, China (2) Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto; M5S 3E5, Canada (3) School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai; 200240, China (4) Yunnan Institute of Environment Science, Kunming; 650034, China (5) Key Lab of Pollution Ecology and Environmental Engineering, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang; 110016, China ",JCROE8,451 Air Pollution - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 525.3 Energy Utilization,,,,,Air pollution - Energy conservation - Energy utilization - Environmental protection - Sustainable development - Zoning,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Dong, Wenbo(wbdong@fudan.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.159,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2012040, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: FTC98503B09a, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fudan University; Number: 2008-318, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2011BAJ06B01, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology; Number: 71033004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the funding from Fudan Tyndall Centre of Fudan University ( FTC98503B09a ), Yunnan Institute of Environment Science ( 2012040 ), Chinese Academy of Sciences ( 2008-318 ), Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71033004 ) and the Ministry of Science and Technology ( 2011BAJ06B01 ).",,09596526,,"February 15, 2016",English,Air pollution control,,33.0,114-123,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Journal of Cleaner Production,,Assessing the environmental sustainability with a co-benefits approach: A study of industrial sector in Baoshan District in Shanghai,,Carbon emissions - Co benefits - Environmental sustainability - Industrial enterprise - Industry sectors - Management measures - Pollution emissions - Shanghai,114
IAENG Int. J. Comput. Sci.,"Ontology, as a useful tool, has been widely applied in various fields, and ontology concept similarity calculation is an essential problem in these application algorithms. A recent method to get similarity between vertices on ontology is not by pairwise computation but based on a function which maps ontology graph into a line and maps every vertex in graph into a real-value, the similarity is measured by the difference of their corresponding scores. The multi-dividing method is suitable for ontology problem and plays a key role in achieving this. Such ontology function is given by learning a training sample which contains a subset of vertices with k classes from ontology graph. In this paper, we propose a new multi-dividing ontology algorithm framework, which is designed to avoid the choice of loss function. Meanwhile, there is such a vertex selection policy in new multi-dividing ontology algorithm that it guarantees that the new algorithm can be employed for an ontology graph with its structure rather than a tree. We provide some theoretical characteristics of the new multi-dividing ontology algorithm, and show that the new algorithm is convergent.",,20162202448682,,"Zhu, Linli (1); Tao, Weige (2); Min, Xiaozhong (1); Gao, Wei (3) ","(1) Department of Computer Engineering, Jiangsu University of Technology, Changzhou, China (2) Department of Electricity and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University of Technology, Changzhou, China (3) Department of Information and Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China ",,"921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Graph theory - Learning algorithms - Trees (mathematics),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Linli(zhulinli@jsut.edu.cn) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18199224,,,,1819656X,2,"May 18, 2016",English,Ontology,,22.0,184-191,,2016,International Association of Engineers,IAENG International Journal of Computer Science,,Theoretical characteristics of ontology learning algorithm in multi-dividing setting,,Algorithm framework - AUC criterion - Essential problems - Multi-dividing - Ontology concepts - Ontology graphs - VC major class - Vertex selection,43
Petrol Sci Technol,"Gasification is a thermochemical process which converts organic fuels into a high caloric value syngas and other chemicals in the presence of a gasification agent. Tar generation represents the strongest barrier for the use of fixed-bed reactors for liquid fuel gasification, whereas sufficing is only possible with catalytic activities and expensive physical processing. In this work, a kinetic model of waste oil gasification was proposed which can be used a flexible model to provide a quantitative prediction of product yield of other fuels. Results were validated against the experimental measurements and showed a good agreement. In accordance with the modeling results, it was found that the greenhouse gas emission (GGE) of waste oil is higher than that of biomass materials, but the caloric value of the syngas generated is higher. The residence time was also recognized as an important design parameter to improve the syngas volume fraction. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,20165003131184,,"Gao, Wei (1); Farahani, Mohammad Reza (2); Rezaei, Mehdi (3); Kanna, Rajesh (4); Rezaee-Manesh, Alireza (5) ","(1) School of Information Science and Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China (2) Department of Applied Mathematics, Iran University of Science and Technology, Narmak, Tehran, Iran (3) Department of Mathematics, Buein Zahra Technical University, Buein Zahra; Qazvin, Iran (4) Post Graduate Department of Mathematics, Maharani's Science College for Women, Mysore, India (5) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Khomein Branch, Islamic Azad University, Khomein, Iran ",PSTEFV,451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 512.1 Petroleum Deposits - 802.1 Chemical Plants and Equipment - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Catalyst activity - Catalysts - Chemical reactors - Crude oil - Fuels - Greenhouse gases - Organic chemicals - Synthesis gas,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Rezaee-Manesh, Alireza(rezaeemaneshreza@gmail.com) ",10.1080/10916466.2016.1235048,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15322459,,,,10916466,24,"December 16, 2016",English,Gasification,,16.0,1946-1951,,2016,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Petroleum Science and Technology,,Mathematical modeling of unsteady-state gasification of petroleum residue,,Design parameters - energy - Fixed bed reactor - Liquid fuel gasification - Petroleum residues - Quantitative prediction - Syn-gas - Thermo chemical process,34
Kong Zhi Li Lun Yu Ying Yong,"In this work, we propose an adaptive iterative learning control algorithm for a class of nonlinearly parameterized systems with unknown control direction and unknown time-varying delay. The existing unknown time-varying delay is well resolved by using parameter separation method and signal replacement mechanism in the process of the design, and the lack of a priori knowledge of the control direction is also dealt with by the Nussbaum-gain technique incorporated into the control design. Moreover, both difference and differential updating laws are configured for the estimates of the unknown time-varying parameter and the constant parameter. Then based on a constructed Lyapunov-Krasovskii composite energy function, a sufficient condition of the convergence of the system error asymptotically along the iteration axis and the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is given. A simulation example is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. © 2016, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"There exist two or more competing products in viral marketing, and the companies can exploit the social interactions of users to propagate the awareness of products. In this paper, we focus on selecting seeds for maximizing the competitive influence spread in social networks. First, we establish the possible graphs based on the propagation probability of edges, and then we use the competitive influence spread model (CISM) to model the competitive spread under the possible graph. Further, we consider the objective function of selecting k seeds of one product under the CISM when the seeds of another product have been known, which is monotone and submodular, and thus we use the CELF (cost-effective lazy forward) algorithm to accelerate the greedy algorithm that can approximate the optimal with 1 − 1/e.

ISIJ Int,"The effect of ultrasonic energy on the pretreatment and leaching of gold from the refractory ore was investigated. Firstly, the refractory ore was pretreated with sodium hydroxide under ultrasound. Secondly, the pretreated ore was leached under ultrasound. The leaching ratio of gold decreased with increasing of the ultrasound pretreatment time from 1 to 5 h and the NaOH concentration from 5 to 20 wt%. The ultrasound increased remarkably the leaching ratio of gold when the pretreated ore was subjected to ultrasound leaching. The results showed that the appropriate acoustic power was a requirement during the ultrasound-intensified leaching. The leaching ratio of gold increased with an increasing of NaCN concentration from 6 to 18 kg/t.

Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult.,"Symbiotic seed germination serves as a preferred method for orchid multiplication related to conservation and reintroduction programs, which involves isolation, identification, and germination-enhancing testing of symbiotic fungi. This study uses seeds of Papilionantheteres, a locally endangered and medicinally valuable epiphytic orchid, to attract germination-enhancing fungi on its four host plants. Only one common and highly compatible fungus (Epa-01 strain, Epulorhiza sp.), isolated from seed baiting near three host plants (Averrhoacarambola, Lagerstroemiavillosa, Callistemonrigidus), enhanced seed germination by more than 80 % and promoted protocorm development to reach stage 5 (with two leaves). Seeds cocultured with the Epa-01 strain and oat meal agar medium significantly outperformed in germination and growth speed compared with those cocultured with asymbiotic germination medium only, indicating that symbiotic seed germination is an effective method for P. teres seedling production. Bark substrate types have profound effects on symbiotic seed germination and protocorm development possibly due to different abundance and growth vitality of the Epa-01 strain on the four host plants. A significant difference was found in the developmental speed of symbiotic seeds between A. carambola and the other three host plants under ex situ and ex vitro seed germination treatments (all P  © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,20160902037550,,"Zhou, Xiang (1, 3); Gao, JiangYun (1, 2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resource and Sustainable Use, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mengla; Yunnan; 666303, China (2) Center for Integrative Conservation, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mengla; Yunnan; 666303, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China ",PTCEDJ,454 Environmental Engineering - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products,,,,,Biodiversity - Cultivation - Fungi,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gao, JiangYun(gjy_2014@163.com) ",10.1007/s11240-016-0964-y,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15735044,,,,01676857,3,2016,English,Seed,,71.0,479-493,,2016,Springer Netherlands,"Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture",,Highly compatible Epa-01 strain promotes seed germination and protocorm development of Papilionanthe teres (Orchidaceae),,Growth speed - Natural habitat - Papilionantheteres - Seed germination - Seedling production - Substrate types - Symbiotic fungi - Symbiotic seed germination,125
Biosens. Bioelectron.,"A novel strategy was developed to prepare double responsive smart upconversion fluorescence material for highly specific enrichment and sensing of glycoprotein. The novel double responsive smart sensing material was synthesized by choosing Horse radish peroxidase (HRP) as modal protein, the grapheme oxide (GO) as support material, upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as fluorescence signal reporter, N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAM) and 4-vinylphenylboronic acid (VPBA) as functional monomers. The structure and component of smart sensing material was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), respectively. These results illustrated the smart sensing material was prepared successfully. The recognition characterizations of smart sensing material were evaluated, and results showed that the fluorescence intensity of smart sensing material was reduced gradually, as the concentration of protein increased, and the smart sensing material showed selective recognition for HRP among other proteins. Furthermore, the recognition ability of the smart sensing material for glycoprotein was regulated by controlling the pH value and temperature. Therefore, this strategy opens up new way to construct smart material for detection of glycoprotein. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162402490187,,"Guo, Ting (1); Deng, Qiliang (1); Fang, Guozhen (1); Yun, Yaguang (1); Hu, Yongjin (2); Wang, Shuo (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin; 300457, China (2) Institute of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Yunnan; 650201, China ",BBIOE4,461.8 Biotechnology - 461.9 Biology - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Biosynthesis - Fluorescence - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Graphene - Graphene oxide - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Intelligent materials - Nanoparticles - Proteins - Scanning electron microscopy - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Deng, Qiliang(yhdql@tust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.bios.2016.05.056,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,"Number: 2013AA102202, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: 2012HA009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31225021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21375094, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 21375094 and 31225021 ), the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Project No. 2013AA102202 ) and Innovation Talents of Science and Technology Plan of Yunnan Province (Project No. 2012HA009 ).

J. Phys. Conf. Ser.,"Searching for planetary companions to evolved stars (e.g., white dwarfs (WD) and Cataclysmic Variables (CV)) can provide insight into the interaction between planets and evolved stars as well as on the ultimate fate of planets. We have monitored decades of CVs and their progenitors including some detached WD binaries since 2006 to search for planets orbiting these systems. In the present paper, we will show some observational results of circumbinary planets in orbits around CVs and their progenitors. Some of our findings include planets with the shortest distance to the central evolved binaries and a few multiple planetary systems orbiting binary stars. Finally, by comparing the observational properties of planetary companions to single WDs and WD binaries, the interaction between planets and evolved stars and the ultimate fate of planets are discussed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Open Access,20164102881779,042006,"Shengbang, Qian (1, 2, 3); Zhongtao, Han (1, 2, 3); Fernández Lajús, E.

Huanjing Kexue,"Phytoremediation is an important measure to remove organic pollutants from contaminated soil, and the root secretion of plant is considered to be closely related to the mechanisms of phytoremediation of organic pollutants. It is in favor of revealing the mechanisms of remediation by studying the characteristics of root exudates of plants with phytoremediation potential under the stress of pollutants. In the present research, pyrene and five species of Festuca which have been testified to be tolerant to pyrene stress were selected as studied objects. A soil-cultivating experiment with rhizobag technique was conducted to investigate the effects of pyrene on low molecule weight organic compounds in the root exudates of plant species under five concentration levels of pyrene (10.19, 20.32, 40.36, 79.94, and 160.68 mg·kg-1, denoted by C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5, respectively) on day 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 of experiments. The results showed that the presence of vegetation significantly enhanced the dissipation of pyrene in the soil environment. This effect was especially marked with Festuca arundinacea, followed by those with Festuca mazzetiana, Festuca pubiglumis, and Festuca longiglumis, and that with Festuca stapfii was the lowest. During the whole experiments, the amounts of soluble sugar excreted by the five species of Festuca tested in root exudates were promoted with pyrene stress, then fluctuated with a stable trend along with the increase of stress concentration or the extension of stress period, which appeared to rise appreciably at relative low pyrene spiked (C1-C3) or earlier stress stage (30-40 d) and reduce at relative high pyrene spiked level (C3-C5) or later stress stage (40-70 d), and the highest amount of soluble sugars in root exudates occurred on day 50 of experiments with 40.36 mg·kg-1pyrene treatment. The greater the phytoremediation potential of the plant species tested, the more obvious this trend wads. Compared with the control treatment (CK), pyrene stress promoted the root system of all five species of Festuca tested to release more low molecular weight organic acids, the stronger the restoration potential of plant species, the higher the concentration of pyrene stress under which the amount of organic acids in root exudates was increased to the peak value. Among the five species of Festuca tested, oxlic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid and malic acid were the main components of organic acids in root exudates, with a percentage of greater than 98.15% in all pyrene stress treatments, but there were traces of fumaric acid in the roots secretion of plant species with the stronger restoration potential. Data also indicated that 19 types of amino acids were found in root exudates of Festuca and the composition of amino acids in root exudates of Festuca was stable under all pyrene stress treatments, but the amino acid amount was different in root exudates under pyrene stress. The amount of all amino acids in those root exudates increased with increasing pyrene concentration, especially, the amount of threonine, serine, glycine, and alanine increased significantly among the 19 types of amino acids and the differences were significant among different treatments with different pyrene concentrations (P © 2016, Science Press.

Phys B Condens Matter,"First-principle calculations were performed to investigate the structural, phase stability, electronic, elastic properties and hardness of monoclinic structure IrN2(m-IrN2), orthorhombic structure IrN2(o-IrN2) and zinc blende structure IrN (ZB IrN). The results show us that only m-IrN2is both thermodynamic and dynamic stability. The calculated band structure and density of states (DOS) curves indicate that o-IrN2and ZB Ir-N compounds we calculated have metallic behavior while m-IrN2has a small band gap of ~0.3 eV, and exist a common hybridization between Ir-5d and N-2p states, which forming covalent bonding between Ir and N atoms. The difference charge density reveals the electron transfer from Ir atom to N atom for three Ir-N compounds, which forming strong directional covalent bonds. Notable, a strong N-N bond appeared in m-IrN2and o-IrN2. The ratio of bulk to shear modulus (B/G) indicate that three Ir-N compounds we calculated are ductile, and ZB IrN possesses a better ductility than two types IrN2. m-IrN2has highest Debye temperature (736 K), illustrating it possesses strongest covalent bonding. The hardness of three Ir-N compounds were also calculated, and the results reveal that m-IrN2(18.23 GPa) and o-IrN2(18.02 GPa) are ultraincompressible while ZB IrN has a negative value, which may be attributed to phase transition at ca. 1.98 GPa. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20164202926257,,"Zhou, Zhaobo (1); Zhou, Xiaolong (1); Zhang, Kunhua (2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province & Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Non-Ferrous and Precious Rare Metals Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Rare Precious Metals Comprehensive Utilization of New Technologies, Kunming Institute of Precious Metals, Kunming; 650106, China ",PHYBE3,"546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921 Mathematics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Atoms - Calculations - Elasticity - Electronic properties - Energy gap - Hardness - Phase stability - Structural properties - Zinc - Zinc sulfide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Xiaolong(kmzxlong@163.com) ",10.1016/j.physb.2016.09.037,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51262015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51262015 ).,,09214526,,"December 15, 2016",English,Iridium compounds,,39.0,141-146,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Physica B: Condensed Matter,,"Structural, phase stability, electronic, elastic properties and hardness of IrN2and zinc blende IrN: First-principles calculations",,Elastic properties - First principle calculations - First principles - First-principles calculation - Monoclinic structures - N-compounds - Orthorhombic structures - Zinc-blende structures,503

"Int. Conf. Probab. Methods Appl. Power Syst., PMAPS - Conf. Proc.","It is well known that cascading failure is one of the key factors which lead to blackout events around the world. How to simulate cascading failure reasonably is one of the important issues to be solved by electrical engineers. An ad-hoc cascading failure model based on probabilistic line outage and failure correlation is proposed in this paper. The proposed model involves AC power flow computation and all possible cases of cascading failure. In this model, some measures including the load shedding strategy and subsequent failure search strategy as well as probabilistic selection of line outage are taken into account during analysis. In addition, some risk indices are introduced to evaluate the vulnerability of power system caused by cascading failure. Finally, simulations performed on IEEE-39 bus test system demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model and method as well as drawing some meaningful conclusions. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171203453762,7764086,"Si, Dajun (1); Sun, Qiming (2); Shi, Libao (2); Qian, Yingchun (1); Qian, Wen (1) ","(1) Research Centre of Power Grid Planning, Yunnan Power Grid Company, Yunnan, China (2) Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China ",,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.1 Electric Power Systems,125203.0,"October 16, 2016 - October 20, 2016","Beijing, China","2016 International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS 2016",Electric fault currents - Electric load flow - Electric power plant loads - Outages,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/PMAPS.2016.7764086,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509019700.0,,,"December 1, 2016",English,Electric load shedding,"2016 International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS 2016 - Proceedings",9.0,,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS 2016 - Proceedings",,Analysis of cascading failure considering load-shedding strategy and failure correlation,,Cascading failures - Load-shedding - Risk indices - Roulette method - Search strategies,
Cailiao Yanjiu Xuebao,"The effect of V and Si on the microstructure and mechanical properties of medium-carbon pearlitic steels for wheel was studied by means of OM, SEM and TEM, as well as tensile and impact tests. The results showed that the austenite grain size, the pearlite colony size and interlamellar spacing were significantly refined by increasing V content, which also led to an increase in the volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite of the steels. With the increasing of V content, the yield strength at room temperature and the impact toughness at - 20 were enhanced due to precipitation strengthening and grain refinement effects of VC. However, the tensile strength at room temperature was decreased due to the increasing of the soft phase, i.e., proeutectoid ferrite. The increase of Si content resulted in the great decrease of proeutectoid ferrite and the significant refinement of pearlite interlamellar spacing but the slight refinement of austenite grain size. Si addition also promoted the VC precipitation but had only a little influence. The yield- and tensile-strength were enhanced mainly by the effect of solid solution strengthening and the refinement of pearlite interlamellar spacing due to Si addition. The balance of strength and toughness in medium-carbon pearlite steels could be effectively optimized by microalloying with the combination of medium 0.07%-0.08%V(mass fraction) and relatively high 0.8%-0.9%Si (mass fraction). © All right reserved.",,20162802581789,,"Zuo, Yue (1, 2); Zhou, Shitong (2, 3); Li, Zhaodong (2); Pan, Tao (2); Xiang, Jinzhong (1); Yong, Qilong (2) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Structural Steels, Central Iron and Steel Research Institute, Beijing; 100081, China (3) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",CYXUEV,531.1 Metallurgy - 531.2 Metallography - 545.3 Steel - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 601.2 Machine Components - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Austenite - Carbon - Ferrite - Grain refinement - Grain size and shape - Mechanical properties - Microalloying - Microstructure - Pearlite - Pearlitic transformations - Phase transitions - Silicon - Strengthening (metal) - Tensile strength - Wheels,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhaodong(lizhaodong@cisri.com.cn) ",10.11901/1005.3093.2015.589,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10053093,6,"June 25, 2016",Chinese,Carbon steel,,20.0,401-408,,2016,Chinese Journal of Materials Research,Cailiao Yanjiu Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Materials Research,,Effect of V and Si on microstructure and mechanical properties of medium-carbon pearlitic steels for wheel,,Metallic material - Microstructure and mechanical properties - Pearlite interlamellar spacing - Precipitation strengthening - Solid solution strengthening - Strength and toughness - Wheel steel - Yield and tensile strength,30
Opt.

The analytical expressions for TPA coefficient are derived with an arbitrary sizedistribution and the transition selection rules are obtained. Results reveal that the intraband transitions in conduction band and valence band contribute much more to TPA than interband transitions.

Nanoscience Nanotechnology Lett.,"In this paper, we report the synthesis and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) applications of gold nanoshuttles (GNSs). We used the conventional cylindrical gold nanorods (GNRs) with rounded ends as the starting materials, which evolved into the overgrowth, fabricating the GNSs with sharp ends. Compared with the GNRs, the GNSs have much stronger extinction intensity at the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance peak, and exhibit much higher SERS activity. By fabricating a paper-based SERS substrate by immobilizing the GNSs into a filter paper, the obtained GNSspaper substrate demonstrates high SERS sensitivity in the detection of malachite green. All these results demonstrate the GNSs a really excellent choice for a variety of SERS-based applications such as food safety, environmental monitoring, and homeland security.

The effects of forward current, absorption circuit parameters and current change rate on the thyristors' reverse recovery characteristics are studied, and the influence mechanism has been analyzed by experiments. The results shows that the change of the forward current and the current change rate can lead to the reverse recovery charge change, which can change the reverse recovery voltage stress of thyristors.

Polym.,"The reactions of di-hydroxymethylurea with phenol under alkaline (pH = 10), weak (pH = 6) and strong acidic (pH = 2) conditions were investigated via the13C-NMR method. Based on the proposed reaction mechanisms, the variations of the structures of different condensed products were analyzed and the competitive relationship between self- and co-condensation reactions was elucidated. The required experimental conditions for co-condensations were clearly pointed out. The main conclusions include: (1) the self-condensation between urea formaldehyde (UF) or phenol formaldehyde (PF) monomers were dominant while the co-condensations were very limited under alkaline conditions. This is because the intermediates produced from urea, methylolurea and phenol are less reactive in co-condensations with respect to self-condensations; (2) under weak acidic conditions, the self-condensations occurred exclusively among the UF monomers. The co-condensation structures were not observed; and (3) the co-condensations became much more competitive under strong acidic conditions as the relative content of the co-condensed methylenic carbon accounts for 53.3%. This result can be rationalized by the high reactivity of the methylolphenol carbocation intermediate toward urea and methylolurea. The revealed reaction selectivity and mechanisms may also be applied to the synthesis of those more complex co-condensed adhesives based on natural phenolic and amino compounds. © 2016 by the authors.",Open Access,20164903095896,391,"Cao, Ming (1, 2); Li, Taohong (1); Liang, Jiankun (1); Wu, Zhigang (1); Zhou, Xiaojian (1); Du, Guanben (1, 2) ","(1) The Yunnan Province Key Lab ofWood Adhesives and Glued Products, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming; 650224, China (2) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing; 210037, China ",,"601.3 Mechanisms - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers",,,,,Alkalinity - Condensation - Formaldehyde - Mechanisms - Metabolism - Monomers - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Phenols - Resins - Urea - Urea formaldehyde resins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Taohong(lith.cool@163.com) ",10.3390/polym8110391,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20734360,"Number: 2015BAD14B03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51273163, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31360159, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the Programs of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (31360159 and 51273163) and the Key Projects in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan Period (2015BAD14B03).,,,11,"November 8, 2016",English,Condensation reactions,,45.0,,,2016,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Polymers,,"A13C-NMR study on the 1,3-dimethylolurea-phenol co-condensation reaction: A model for amino-phenolic co-condensed resin synthesis",,13C NMR - Acidic conditions - Alkaline conditions - Experimental conditions - Phenol formaldehyde - Phenol urea formaldehydes - Reaction mechanism - Reaction selectivity,8
RSC Adv.,"SnO2microspheres in a composite with Pt nanoparticles (0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 5.0 mol% Pt loading) were synthesized by a solvothermal method. The crystal structure, morphology, and specific surface area were thoroughly characterized. It is found that the Pt-SnO2nanocomposites consist of a large amount of small spheres with average diameters up to hundreds of nanometers, and every small sphere is composed of numerous primary nanocrystallites with an average size of about 8 nm. Compared with the pristine SnO2, the presence of Pt nanoparticles has no influence on the growth behavior of the SnO2microspheres. The gas sensors based SnO2microspheres in a composite with Pt nanoparticles not only show a lower operating temperature and immensely enhanced responses, but also exhibit a faster response and recovery speeds and remarkable stability to methanol, especially the 5.0 mol% Pt-SnO2nanocomposite. The gas sensor based on the 5.0 mol% Pt-SnO2nanocomposite exhibits a response value of 190.88 to 100 ppm methanol at a low operating temperature of 80 °C, while the gas sensor based on pristine SnO2only displayed a response value of 19.38 at an operating temperature of 200 °C. The reasonable explanation of the gas-sensing performance enhancement for the gas sensors based on Pt-SnO2nanocomposites is attributed to the strong spillover effect of the Pt nanoparticles and the electronic interaction between Pt nanoparticles and SnO2microspheres, both of which promoted the low temperature gas-sensing performance. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20163802816912,,"Li, Yuxiu (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Chen, Nan (2); Xing, Xinxin (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 3); Wang, Yude (2, 3) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,547.1 Precious Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice,,,,,Chemical detection - Chemical sensors - Crystal structure - Gas detectors - Gases - Metal nanoparticles - Methanol - Microspheres - Nanocomposites - Synthesis (chemical) - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6ra16636a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51262029) and Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University.",,,87,2016,English,Platinum,,42.0,83870-83879,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Enhanced methanol sensing properties of SnO2microspheres in a composite with Pt nanoparticles,,Average diameter - Electronic interactions - Low operating temperature - Low temperatures - Operating temperature - Pt nanoparticles - Solvothermal method - Spillover effects,6

We represent here the feasibility of incorporating graphene into mesoscopic TiO2with an aim of reducing electron loss within an anode. Results indicate that the short-circuit current density has been markedly enhanced due to the facile transfer of photogenerated electrons along graphene network from conduction band of TiO2nanocrystallites.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Inf. Autom., ICIA","Planetary gearboxes are widely used in wind turbine, aerospace, marine and other large engineering machines. Then, the sun gear fault diagnosis is important. Due to nonstationary, modulation, and complex transmission paths, the observed vibration is more difficult to analysis. The tradition of time-domain synchronous average (TSA) is invalid for the characteristics extraction of sun gear fault. To address this issue, the windowed synchronous average originally proposed by McFadden can be employed to extract the useful components and reduce the effect of transmission paths. However, the observed vibration under varying speed conditions of rotating machinery exist the speed fluctuation, which can lead waveform distortion. An improved version of the windowed synchronous average is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the windowed time-domain signal is sampled at constant angle increments according to computed order tracking (COT), which converts the non-stationary signal in the time domain into the stationary one in the angle domain. Then, the windowed signal in angle domain was processed by synchronous average (SA). In this way, the frequency blur and waveform distortion caused by rotating speed fluctuation can be eliminated. Tests were conducted to verify the validity of the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171203484688,7831926,"Wang, Zhile (1); Guo, Yu (1); Wu, Xing (1) ","(1) Key Lab. of Vib. and Noise under Ministry of Education of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",,"601.1 Mechanical Devices - 601.2 Machine Components - 615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 921 Mathematics",126277.0,"August 1, 2016 - August 3, 2016","Ningbo, China","2016 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation, IEEE ICIA 2016",Electric distortion - Failure analysis - Fault detection - Gears - Rotating machinery - Vibration analysis - Wind turbines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Guo, Yu(kmgary@163.com) ",10.1109/ICInfA.2016.7831926,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 51365023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.51365023).,9781509041022.0,,,"January 24, 2017",English,Time domain analysis,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation, IEEE ICIA 2016",8.0,785-790,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation, IEEE ICIA 2016",,Sun gear fault diagnosis based on windowed synchronous average in angle domain,,Angle synchronous average - Computed order tracking - Planetary gearboxes - Sun gears - Time synchronous average,

Opt. Express,"Robust phase unwrapping in the presence of high noise remains an open issue. Especially, when both noise and fringe densities are high, pre-filtering may lead to phase dislocations and smoothing that complicate even more unwrapping. In this paper an approach to deal with high noise and to unwrap successfully phase data is proposed. Taking into account influence of noise in wrapped data, a calibration method of the 1st order spatial phase derivative is proposed and an iterative approach is presented. We demonstrate that the proposed method is able to process holographic phase data corrupted by non-Gaussian speckle decorrelation noise. The algorithm is validated by realistic numerical simulations in which the fringe density and noise standard deviation is progressively increased. Comparison with other established algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm exhibits better accuracy and shorter computation time, whereas others may fail to unwrap. The proposed algorithm is applied to phase data from digital holographic metrology and the unwrapped results demonstrate its practical effectiveness. The realistic simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed unwrapping algorithm is robust and fast in the presence of strong speckle decorrelation noise. © 2016 Optical Society of America.",,20165103151538,,"Xia, Haiting (1, 2, 3); Montresor, Silvio (3); Guo, Rongxin (1, 2); Li, Junchang (5); Yan, Feng (1, 2); Cheng, Heming (1); Picart, Pascal (3, 4) ","(1) Faculty of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Key Laboratory of Yunnan Higher Education Institutes for Mechanical Behavior and Microstructure Design of Advanced Materials, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (3) Université du Maine, CNRS UMR 6613, LAUM, Avenue Olivier Messiaen, Le Mans Cedex 9; 72085, France (4) École Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs du Mans, rue Aristote, Le Mans Cedex 9; 72085, France (5) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",,741.1 Light/Optics - 743 Holography - 746 Imaging Techniques - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Calibration - Holography - Speckle,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Picart, Pascal(pascal.picart@univ-lemans.fr) ",10.1364/OE.24.028713,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10944087,"Number: 11462009, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11362007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: ANR-14-ASTR-0005-01, Acronym: RRA, Sponsor: National Radio Research Agency; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (11362007, 11462009); French National Agency for Research (ANR) (ANR-14-ASTR-0005-01).",,,25,"December 12, 2016",English,Iterative methods,,39.0,28713-28730,,2016,OSA - The Optical Society,Optics Express,,Phase calibration unwrapping algorithm for phase data corrupted by strong decorrelation speckle noise,,Calibration method - Iterative approach - Phase calibration - Phase derivatives - Phase dislocation - Realistic simulation - Speckle decorrelation - Standard deviation,24

In a cognitive radio system, the recognition of signal modulation is a key technology, which would help the cognitive radio system to configure and realize intelligent green communication. In general, the recognition of signal modulation is not a linear classification. Back propagation (BP) neural network could solve the nonlinear classification. In this paper, we propose a training technique, cubature Kalman filters (CKF) to train a BP network.

TMS Light Met.,"In this research, thermodynamic analysis and CASTEP package of the Material Studio program which is based on density functional theory (DFT) formalism were used to study the carbothermic- Chlorination (AlCl3) reaction of AI2O under vacuum. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that AlCl(g) can be generated by carbothermic-chlorination process at 1760K and 60Pa. The interaction of Al2O and AlCh with C showed that the chemical adsorption of Al2O and AICI3 did take place on C(001) crystal plane, at the same time, new chemical bond have been formed between A1 atom dissociated from Al2O and CI atom dissociated from Al2O molecule. The result, after lps dynamics simulation, indicated that adsorbed A1C1 and CO molecules have been generated in AI2O-AICI3-C system, and they would escape from C surface after a longer period of dynamics simulation time.

J Am Ceram Soc,"Point defects are very important for semiconductor photocatalyst: promoting visible-light absorption, tailoring energy bands, trapping photogenerated carriers, etc. As promising high efficient photocatalyst, BiOI could absorb most solar energy, and has high oxidization activity. However, its conduction band edge is lower than the reduction potential of H+/H2, thus BiOI could not achieve overall photocatalytic water splitting. In the present work, the crystal structure and electronic structure of BiOI with three different types of point defects are systematically investigated by density functional theory calculations, to find suitable strategy to solve above issue. Based on detailed analysis of calculated results, it is found that antisite defect of I@Bi (iodine occupies the bismuth site) and oxygen vacancy defect in BiOI could achieve above requirement: their conduction band and valence band edge positions are straddle the redox potential of water, resulting in as the promising photocatalyst candidates for overall water splitting driven by visible light. The findings could provide reasonable explanations for the reported experiments, and are beneficial to the development of novel bismuth oxyhalogenide-based photocatalyst. © 2016 The American Ceramic Society",,20162302455913,,"Dai, Wen-Wu (1); Zhao, Zong-Yan (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",JACTAW,549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Bismuth - Calculations - Conduction bands - Crystal structure - Defects - Density functional theory - Electronic structure - Light - Light absorption - Oxygen vacancies - Photocatalysis - Point defects - Redox reactions - Solar energy - Vacancies,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Zong-Yan(zzy@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1111/jace.14311,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15512916,"Number: 2015HB015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21473082, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 21473082), and 18th Yunnan Province Young Academic and Technical Leaders Reserve Talent Project (grant no. 2015HB015).",,00027820,9,2016,English,Bismuth compounds,,37.0,3015-3024,,2016,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,,Defect Physics of BiOI as High Efficient Photocatalyst Driven by Visible Light,,Conduction band edge - First principles - Oxygen vacancy defects - Photocatalytic water splitting - Photogenerated carriers - Reduction potential - Semiconductor photocatalyst - Visible light absorption,99

Fluid Phase Equilib.,"Vacuum distillation experiments were conducted for tin-antimony alloy (Sn-Sb alloy) under the system pressure of 5 Pa. The content of Sb (mole fraction) in crude Sn, viz., xSbwas reduced from 0.5000 to 0.0619 in a single stage distillation process under the condition of residual pressure of 5-10 Pa, distillation temperature of 1373 K and distillation time of 60 min. The activity coefficients of components of Sn-Sb alloy were calculated by using the molecular interaction volume model (MIVM), and the calculated average relative deviation and the average standard deviation were ±0.00039 and ± 0.173%, respectively for both Sn and Sb. The vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) phase diagrams, including the temperature-composition (T-x) and pressure-composition (p-x) diagrams of Sn-Sb alloy in vacuum distillation were calculated based on VLE theory and the MIVM. A reasonable agreement between the calculated results and the experimental data indicates that VLE phase diagrams obtained by this method are reliable. The VLE phase diagrams of alloys will provide an effective and convenient way for the designing of the process parameters of industrial production of vacuum metallurgy, and for the prediction of the needed product component dependence of temperature and pressure during the process of vacuum distillation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20160801986527,,"Kong, Lingxin (1, 2, 3); Xu, Junjie (1, 2, 3); Xu, Baoqiang (1, 2, 3); Xu, Shuai (1, 2, 3); Yang, Bin (1, 2, 3); Zhou, Yuezhen (1, 2, 3); Li, Yifu (1, 2, 3); Liu, Dachun (1, 2, 3) ","(1) National Engineering Laboratory of Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Vacuum Metallurgy for Non-Ferrous Metal of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650093, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization in Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650093, China ",FPEQDT,531.1 Metallurgy - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 546.4 Antimony and Alloys - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 913.1 Production Engineering - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Antimony alloys - Distillation - Graphic methods - Metallurgy - Molecular interactions - Molecular structure - Phase diagrams - Phase equilibria - Product design,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Yifu(29376154@qq.com) ",10.1016/j.fluid.2016.02.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014HA003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51474116, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014RA4018, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014FA001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects; Number: IRT1250, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The authors are grateful for financial support from the General Program of Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 51474116 , the Cultivating Plan Program for the Leader in Science and Technology of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2014HA003 , the Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China under Grant No. IRT1250 , the Project for Nonferrous metals Vacuum Metallurgy Innovation Team of Ministry of Science and Technology under Grant No. 2014RA4018 , the Key Project of Science and Technology Program of Yunnan Province Grant No. 2014FA001 .",,03783812,,"May 15, 2016",English,Tin alloys,,25.0,176-183,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Fluid Phase Equilibria,,Vapor-liquid phase equilibria of binary tin-antimony system in vacuum distillation: Experimental investigation and calculation,,Distillation temperature - Experimental investigations - Molecular interaction volume model - Pressure compositions - Sn-sb alloys - Temperature and pressures - Temperature composition - Vacuum distillation,415
Int. Commun. Heat Mass Transf.,"In this study, a series of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) were carried out using ANSYS Fluent for transitional plane fountains in linearly stratified fluids with the Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr) and dimensionless temperature stratification parameter (s) over 28 ≤ Re ≤ 300, 3 ≤ Fr ≤ 10, and 0.1 ≤ s ≤ 0.5, to study and quantify the effects of these governing parameters on the maximum fountain penetration height, including the initial one during the early developing stage and the time-averaged one at the quasi-steady state, as well as the time to reach the initial maximum penetration height. The results show that both the initial and time-averaged maximum fountain heights as well as the time to attain the initial maximum fountain height increase with Fr but decrease with s, whereas the effect of Re is negligible, and the fluctuations of the maximum fountain penetration height at some specific locations at the quasi-steady state also follow the similar trends. Empirical correlations to quantify the effects of Fr, s and Re on these bulk fountain behavior parameters were obtained from the DNS results over the ranges of Fr, s and Re considered. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20162902623907,,"Inam, Mohammad Ilias (1); Lin, Wenxian (1, 2); Armfield, S.W.

"Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Electron. Inf. Commun. Technol., ICEICT","Based on the Babinet Principle, a new metamaterial sensor is proposed in microwave region. The main part of the device is a microstrip coupled complementary asymmetric double-split resonator (CADSR). In this device, an extremely sharp resonance have been obtained due to the excitation of 'trapped modes'. From the analysis, the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the frequency response and Q-Factor are thoroughly studied. Results show that there have an upward tendency of Q-Factor when increasing the degree of asymmetry, the distribution of the electric field and transmission response (S2i) have been also simulated in this work. Finally, the process and the performance is illustrated when CADSR is used as a sensor. We found that both dielectric constant and loss tangent of sample substance affect the resonance frequency. It is demonstrated that the reflection spectrum shift to lower frequency side when enhancing the permittivity of sample substance which is filled in groove. Furthermore, the CADSR will increase the contact area with field and sample, and the relation between resonant frequency and the sample permittivity exhibits a perfect linearity. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171503559936,7879731,"Li, Xi Ming (1); Yu, Jiang (1); Li, Peng (1); Yang, Jing Jing (1); Huang, Ming (1, 2) ","(1) Wireless Innovation Lab. of Yunnan University, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China (2) Key Laboratory for Spectrum Sensing and Borderlands, Radio Safety of High Education, Yunnan Province, China ",,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 732.2 Control Instrumentation - 942.2 Electric Variables Measurements - 951 Materials Science,126845.0,"August 20, 2016 - August 22, 2016","Harbin, China","2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016",Electric fields - Frequency response - Metamaterials - Natural frequencies - Permittivity - Q factor measurement - Resonators,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICEICT.2016.7879731,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 20125301120009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20135301110003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015FA015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013FA006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61461052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61261002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11564044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Our work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61261002, 61461052, 11564044), and was supported by the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (Grant No. 20135301110003, 20125301120009), and the Key Program of Natural Science of Yunnan Province (Grant Nos. 2013FA006, 2015FA015).",9781509007288.0,,,"March 15, 2017",English,Microwave sensors,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016",20.0,424-427,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016","China Academy of Space Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Space Microwave; Science and Technology on Millimeter-Wave Laboratory; State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University",Metamaterial-inspired sensor based on a complementary asymmetric double-split resonator,,Babinet principles - CADSR - Degree of asymmetry - Metamaterial-inspired - Reflection spectra - Resonance frequencies - Transmission response - Trapped modes,

IEEE Trans Dielectr Electr Insul,"To understand the effect of thermal ageing mechanism on space charge formation and dissipation in double-layered polyester films (PET), the time dependence of space charge characteristics at physical interface and in the bulk of PET films have been investigated. The measurements of space charge characteristics in specimens of different thermal ageing conditions (80 and 130 °C) were conducted under different DC field strengths (polarization) and short circuit conditions (depolarization) using the Pulsed Electro Acoustic (PEA) measurement system. The influence of electric field distortion caused by the space charges on average AC breakdown strength of PET specimens was also investigated. Results indicate that the thermal ageing leads to polymer interface acts as positive charge traps at ageing temperature of 80 °C, but acts as electron traps at ageing temperature of 130 °C and provides deeper trapping level for positive charge carriers. Besides these, average breakdown strength of the composite decreases due to the electric field distortion caused by the space charges. A preliminary study of this phenomenon is given and further investigation is needed. © 2016 IEEE.",,20164903078261,7736881,"Jiang, Xiongwei (1); Sima, Wenxia (1); Peng, Qingjun (2); Yang, Ming (1); Sun, Potao (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China (2) Electric Power Research Institute, Yunnan Power Grid Corporation, Kunming; 650106, China ",ITDIES,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 817.1 Polymer Products - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Acoustoelectric effects - Depolarization - Electric breakdown - Electric space charge - Low density polyethylenes - Plastic films - Polyesters - Thermal aging,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TDEI.2016.7736881,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10709878,5,October 2016,English,Interfaces (materials),,26.0,3156-3164,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,,Effect of thermal ageing on space charge characteristics in double-layered polyester film,,AC breakdowns - Breakdown strengths - Electric field distortions - Physical interface - Pulsed electro acoustics - Short-circuit conditions - Space charge formations - Space-charge characteristics,23
Int. J. Heat Mass Transf.,"The characteristic of flow and heat transfer in double-layered microchannels with cavities and ribs is investigated numerically. The intensity of secondary flow (Se) and field synergy principle are used to evaluate the heat transfer performance. The results show that the effect of arrangement of cavities and ribs on friction factor and Nusselt number is obviously. The opposite cavities and aligned ribs aside the microchannel wall (Channel C) exhibit the highest intensity of secondary flow, thus resulting in the highest Nusselt number and pressure drop simultaneously. From the view point of field synergy principle, Channel C has the smallest value of field synergy angle β and the highest value of field synergy number Fc, which indicates the best synergy relationship between velocity and temperature fields. Lastly, a thermal enhanced factor is used to evaluate the comprehensive effect of flow friction and heat transfer. The thermal enhanced factor of Channel C increases with Se firstly and then decreases. The offset cavities and ribs aside the microchannel wall (Channel B) shows the best comprehensive effect in the range of Reynolds number and Se studied here. Therefore, Reasonable geometric design of double-layered microchannels must be considered to enhance heat transfer and decrease pressure drop as well. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20162302463174,,"Zhai, Yuling (1); Li, Zhouhang (1); Wang, Hua (1); Xu, Jianxin (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China ",IJHMAK,"631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.2 Heat Transfer",,,,,Drops - Friction - Nusselt number - Pressure drop - Reynolds number - Secondary flow,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhai, Yuling(zhaiyuling00@126.com) ",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.05.025,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2015HA019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 10978193, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This work is supported by Scientific and Technological Leading Talent Projects in Yunnan Province (No. 2015HA019), the Recruitment Program of High-level Talents, Kunming University of Science and Technology (No. 10978193).",,00179310,,"October 1, 2016",English,Microchannels,,26.0,190-197,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,,Analysis of field synergy principle and the relationship between secondary flow and heat transfer in double-layered microchannels with cavities and ribs,,Comprehensive effect - Double layered - Enhanced heat transfer - Field synergy numbers - Field synergy principle - Flow and heat transfer - Heat transfer performance - Velocity and temperature fields,101
Prog. Energy Combust. Sci.,"Mono-functional catalytic materials are used for many types of chemical transformations, but are tedious for delivering products from multiple-step reactions required for the valorization of biomass. An emerging trend is to integrate catalytic transformations, reaction engineering and product separation into a single operation, wherein catalyst design is considered as the key approach to develop efficient, low energy and environmentally-friendly reaction systems. Bifunctional solid catalysts open a door for carrying out domino/cascade- and tandem/sequential-type reactions in a single pot, for which the number of isolation or purification steps can be lessened or eliminated so that removal of unwanted by-products becomes unnecessary. This review introduces bifunctional materials used in one-pot multiple transformations of biomass into biofuels and related chemicals. Emphasis is placed on the assessment of the bifunctionality of catalytic materials, including Bronsted-Lewis acid, acid-base, and metal particles-acid or base bifunctional catalysts with some discussion being on combined catalytic systems with electrochemical, chemo-enzymatic and photochemical methods. Plausible reaction mechanisms for key pathways are shown. Relevant auxiliaries to boost catalytic activity and product selectivity, such as reaction media, heating modes and morphological properties of the catalytic materials are analyzed. Use of appropriate bifunctional catalytic materials provides many opportunities for design of highly efficient reaction systems and simplified processing for producing biofuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,"In the multi-label classification issue, some implicit constraints and dependencies are always existed among labels. Exploring the correlation information among different labels is important for many applications. It not only can enhance the classifier performance but also can help to interpret the classification results for some specific applications. This paper presents an improved multi-label classification method based on local label constraints and classifier chains for solving multi-label tasks with large number of labels. Firstly, in order to exploit local label constraints in multi-label problem with large number of labels, clustering approach is utilized to segment training label set into several subsets. Secondly, for each label subset, local tree-structure constraints among different labels are mined based on mutual information metric. Thirdly, based on the mined local tree-structure label constraints, a variant of classifier chain strategy is implemented to enhance the multi-label learning system. Experiment results on five multi-label benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is a competitive approach for solving multi-label classification tasks with large number of labels. © 2016 IEEE.",,20165203194534,7727370.0,"Chen, Benhui (1, 2); Li, Weite (3); Zhang, Yuqing (1); Hu, Jinglu (3) ","(1) School of Computer and Control Engineering, University of Chinese, Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 101408, China (2) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan Province, China (3) Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu-shi, Fukuoka, Japan ",85OFAE,"602.1 Mechanical Drives - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",124695.0,"July 24, 2016 - July 29, 2016","Vancouver, BC, Canada","2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2016",Chains - Learning systems - Trees (mathematics),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727370,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 2014M550806, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao; Number: 61462003, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71462001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61462003, No. 71462001), the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (No. 2014M550806), and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry, PR China.",9781509006199.0,,,"October 31, 2016",English,Classification (of information),"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2016",18.0,1458-1463,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE CIS),Enhancing multi-label classification based on local label constraints and classifier chains,,Classification results - Classifier chains - Classifier performance - Clustering approach - Implicit constraints - Multi label classification - Multi-label learning - Multi-label problems,2016-October
"Chinese Control Conf., CCC","BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace, BOF) steelmaking endpoint prediction is one of the most important steps in the blowing process. The flame recognition has proven as a useful method for endpoint prediction. But the previous methods are not suitable to extract the flame characteristic because of flame randomness and multi-scales problems. A multi-scale color difference histogram features weighted fusion method is proposed to describe the flame changes during the blowing process. The segmented images are converted into the L∗a∗b∗ space; the color difference histogram is built based on the defined calculation model and the features are calculated to describe the histogram; in order to fuse multi scales characteristics as a whole feature vector and contains each scale features in a reasonable level, a multi-scale features weighted function is defined; finally, the GRNN (General Regression Neural Network, GRNN) recognition model is built to realize the blowing stage prediction according to the flame features.

Metall Mat Trans A Phys Metall Mat Sci,"The possibility of the separation of Pb-Sb alloys by vacuum distillation was investigated theoretically. The results show that Pb and Sb can be separated by vacuum distillation. However, the experimental results show that vacuum distillation technique does not provide clear separation. According to the literature, Pb-Sb alloys belong to azeotropic compounds under some certain temperature; the experiment and computer simulation were carried out based on the exceptional condition so as to analyze the reason from the experiment and microstructure of Pb-Sb alloys perspective. The separation of Pb-Sb alloys by vacuum distillation was experimentally carried out to probe the azeotropic point. Also, the functions, such as partial radial distributions functions, the structure factor, mean square displacement, and the density of state, were calculated by ab-initio molecular dynamics for the representation of the structure and properties of Pb-Sb alloys with different composition of Sb. The experimental results indicate that there exists common volatilization for Pb-Sb alloys when Sb content is 16.5 wt pct. On the other hand, the calculation results show that there is an intense interaction between Pb and Sb when Sb content is 22 wt pct, which supports the experimental results although Sb content is slightly deviation. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,20163102654435,,"Song, Bingyi (1, 2, 3); Jiang, Wenlong (1, 2, 3); Yang, Bin (1, 2, 3); Chen, Xiumin (1, 2, 3); Xu, Baoqiang (1, 2, 3); Kong, Lingxin (1, 2, 3); Liu, Dachun (1, 2, 3); Dai, Yongnian (1) ","(1) National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, No 253#, Xuefu Road, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory for Nonferrous Vacuum Metallurgy of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650093, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clear Utilization in Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650093, China ",MMTAEB,546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.4 Antimony and Alloys - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Antimony alloys - Calculations - Distillation - Molecular dynamics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jiang, Wenlong(jiangwlkg@foxmail.com) ",10.1007/s11661-016-3663-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10735623,10,"October 1, 2016",English,Lead alloys,,38.0,5214-5222,,2016,Springer Boston,Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A: Physical Metallurgy and Materials Science,,Study on Exploration of Azeotropic Point of Pb-Sb Alloys by Vacuum Distillation and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamic Simulation,,Ab initio molecular dynamics - Azeotropic points - Calculation results - Mean square displacement - Radial distributions - Structure and properties - Structure factors - Vacuum distillation,47
Beilstein J. Nanotechnology,"Proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue serine proteases, and cathepsins (CTS) exhibit numerous functions in tumor biology. Solid tumors are characterized by changes in protease expression levels by tumor and surrounding tissue. Therefore, monitoring protease levels in tissue samples and liquid biopsies is a vital strategy for early cancer detection. Water-dispersable Fe/Fe3O4-core/shell based nanoplatforms for protease detection are capable of detecting protease activity down to sub-femtomolar limits of detection. They feature one dye (tetrakis(carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP)) that is tethered to the central nanoparticle by means of a protease-cleavable consensus sequence and a second dye (Cy 5.5) that is directly linked. Based on the protease activities of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), MMPs 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, and 13, as well as CTS B and L, human breast cancer can be detected at stage I by means of a simple serum test. By monitoring CTS B and L stage 0 detection may be achieved. This initial study, comprised of 46 breast cancer patients and 20 apparently healthy human subjects, demonstrates the feasibility of proteaseactivity- based liquid biopsies for early cancer diagnosis. © 2016 Udukala et al.",Open Access,20164502996320,,"Udukala, Dinusha N.

Process Biochem.,"Aporphine alkaloids were transformed into the corresponding stereospecific 4R-hydroxyaporphine alkaloids through the solid-state fermentation of Stephania epigaea with Clonostachys rogersoniana. This process was validated by both solid- and liquid-state fermentations with aporphine alkaloids as substrates. Cytochrome P450 enzymes were confirmed to participate in the catalysis of this biotransformation. 4R-Hydroxyaporphine alkaloids exhibit the same levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory and cytotoxic activities as aporphine alkaloids and are considerably more water soluble than aporphine alkaloids, indicating their potential as water-soluble AChE inhibitors and antitumor agents. This paper suggests that C. rogersoniana fermentation can facilitate a novel biotransformation of aporphine alkaloids in S. epigaea to 4R-hydroxyaporphine alkaloids. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20161902365953,,"Cai, Le (1); Dong, Jian-Wei (1); Zhao, Li-Xing (2); Zhou, Hao (1); Xing, Yun (1); Li, Ying (1); Li, Zhen-Jie (1); Duan, Wei-He (1); Li, Xue-Jiao (1); Ding, Zhong-Tao (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource, Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",PBCHE5,801.2 Biochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Bioconversion - Fermentation - Metabolites,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ding, Zhong-Tao(ztding@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.procbio.2016.04.016,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: IRT13095, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: 2015-14, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 81460648, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81460536, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81460536 and 81460648 ), a grant from the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University ( IRT13095 ), and a grant from the New Academic Researcher Award for Doctoral Candidates of Yunnan Province (No. 2015-14 ).

Electrochim Acta,"MnO2was self-grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) via a facile redox reaction, which is constructed by interconnected ultrathin nanosheets array. The CFP acts as both a supporting scaffold and a reducing agent for MnO2growth. The obtained MnO2/CFP composite was directly used as electrodes for supercapacitors, delivering a high specific capacitance of 713.7 F/g (0.5 A/g). Cyclic stability testing of the MnO2/CFP electrode reveals 86.8% retention in specific capacitance after 1200 cycles at 5.0 A/g. The nanosheet morphology of the MnO2on CFP brings about more efficient electroactive sites and facilitates the electrolyte penetration, allowing greater access for ions to active reaction sites.

IEEE Trans. Neural Networks Learn. Sys.,"Saliency detection is used to identify the most important and informative area in a scene, and it is widely used in various vision tasks, including image quality assessment, image matching, and object recognition. Manifold ranking (MR) has been used to great effect for the saliency detection, since it not only incorporates the local spatial information but also utilizes the labeling information from background queries. However, MR completely ignores the feature information extracted from each superpixel. In this paper, we propose an MR-based matrix factorization (MRMF) method to overcome this limitation. MRMF models the ranking problem in the matrix factorization framework and embeds query sample labels in the coefficients. By incorporating spatial information and embedding labels, MRMF enforces similar saliency values on neighboring superpixels and ranks superpixels according to the learned coefficients. We prove that the MRMF has good generalizability, and develops an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Nesterov method. Experiments using popular benchmark data sets illustrate the promise of MRMF compared with the other state-of-the-art saliency detection methods. © 2015 IEEE.",,20153301174768,7185439.0,"Tao, Dapeng (1); Cheng, Jun (2, 3); Song, Mingli (4); Lin, Xu (2, 5) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Laboratory for Human Machine Control, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen; 518055, China (3) Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong (4) College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (5) Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Vision Based Monitoring for Hydroelectric Engineering, China Three Gorges University, Yichang; 443002, China ",,921 Mathematics,,,,,Matrix algebra - Object recognition - Optimization - Pixels - Superpixels,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2461554,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),21622388,,,,2162237X,6,June 2016,English,Factorization,,71.0,1122-1134,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,,Manifold Ranking-Based Matrix Factorization for Saliency Detection,,Feature information - Image quality assessment - Manifold ranking - Matrix factorizations - Optimization algorithms - Saliency detection - Spatial informations - State of the art,27

Gaodianya Jishu,"To study the characteristic and influential factors of winding axial vibration, we built a 3D finite element model of 10 kV/400 V transformer. By using ANSYS Maxwell and ANSYS Workbench, we calculated the vibration characteristics and compared the results with the experimental results. The mechanical properties of transformer spacer which plays an important role in winding axial vibration and its influence on vibration, such as clamping pressure, temperature.Moreover, the degradation of spacer were studied through FEA model and the results were also proved to be credible in temperature-rise tests, looseness of clamping pressure tests, and vibration statistics of field transformer. The results show that the amplitude of fundamental frequency and the high order harmonics of the transformer vibration will decrease as the clamping force rises. The fundamental frequency vibration increases linearly with the oil temperature and the operating life hardly contributes to the fundamental frequency vibration but the total harmonic distortion of vibration can increase along with the increase of service life. © 2016, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

SIAM J. Optim.,"In this paper, adopting an admissible function φ, we consider a kind of generalized metric subregularity/regularity of a multifunction F with respect to φ, which is a natural generalization of the Hölder metric regularity. In the special case when F is the subdifferential mapping of a proper lower semicontinuous function f, it is known that such a generalized metric subregularity is very closely related to the well-posedness of f. Using the technique of variational analysis and in terms of the coderivative, we established some sufficient conditions for a multifunction to be metrically subregular/regular with respect to an admissible function φ. In particular, we extend some existing results on the metric regularity and Hölder metric regularity. © 2016 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",,20161502213241,,"Zheng, Xi Yin (1); Zhu, Jiangxing (2) ","(1) Department of Mathematics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Mathematics, Yunnan University, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong ",,723.1 Computer Programming,,,,,Software engineering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1137/15M1016345,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10526234,1,2016,English,Computer science,,33.0,535-563,,2016,Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications,SIAM Journal on Optimization,,Generalized metric subregularity and regularity with respect to an admissible function,,Admissible functions - Coderivative - Metric regularity - Metric subregularity - Subdifferentials,26

Three different sections of power loss, including hysteresis loss, abnormal loss, and eddy current loss, were measured and calculated, respectively. The loss variation and ratio were analyzed based on the experimental data. At 1.0 T, hysteresis loss of tested steel with scribing spacing of 8 mm descends by 8.2% compared to samples without scribing, which is similar to the total loss variation, and abnormal loss descends by 16.8%. At 1.0 T, hysteresis loss ratio of the steel with scribing spacing of 16 mm ascends from 55.7% to 57.9%, and eddy current loss increases from 17.4% to 24.1%, while abnormal loss descends from 26.9% to 23.7%.

Baozha Yu Chongji,"During high strain rate and large strain deformation of crystalline metals, there exist phenomena of continuous refinement of microstructural characteristic length, like the size of dislocation cells, which occurs intensively and would have significant influence on the work hardening and macroscopic flow stress. In this work, based on the inverse relation between macroscopic flow stress and and the cell size, a new type of BCJ constitutive model was proposed. The flow rule and evolution equations for internal state variables in BCJ model were modified by involving the cell size parameter; the evolution equation for the cell size considering the dependence of the strain rate and the temperature was introduced into the model; and an internal state variable viscoplastic constitutive model that considers the evolution of microstructural characteristic length, accumulation and annihilation of dislocations was then established. The new constitutive model was illustrated by predicting the experimental stress-strain data of OFHC Cu over a wide range of strain rates (10-4-103s-1), temperatures (298-542 K) and strains (0-1). The results show that the predicted data agree very well with the experimental data.

The results show that the rock strength and dynamic failure form of jointed rocks are related to the thickness of joint fillings, with the increase of joint fillings thickness, rock dynamic compressive strength reduce gradually. The failure form of jointed rocks is mainly tensile fracture, but the existence of joint filling lead to change in the start point of failure, and cause unilateral destruction correspondingly. The reflected ability and the attenuation of transmitted wave increase with the joint thickness increasing under the same incident energy. Both the incident energy and reflect energy increase with the impact velocity, while the transmitted energy shows increasing at the beginning and decreasing later. The damage parameter d, expressed by energy, increases with impact velocity, as equation: d=-0.11v2+1.31v-3.01, and the fracture degree of joint rock will increase with the value of d. © 2016, Editorial Board of Journal of CUMT.

Thin Solid Films,"The influences of sulfurization process on Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) film characters were investigated through soft-annealing and sulfurization precursors, which were prepared by sputtering at room temperature with metal targets and sulfide targets. The Sn-loss of CZTS film was researched by comparing different CZTS films based on metallic precursors and sulfur-contained precursors. As a result, the CZTS film based on metallic precursors showed more serious Sn-loss than that from sulfur-contained precursors. Moreover, the experimental results also demonstrated that an appropriate temperature-time profile during sulfuring process can act as a crucial factor on the morphologies and Sn-loss of CZTS films, and the CZTS films with fine morphologies and appropriate composition were obtained by modifying the time-temperature profile during sulfurization process.

J. Environ. Sci.,"Microorganisms are involved in a variety of biogeochemical processes in natural environments. The differences between bacterial communities in freshwaters and upslope soils remain unclear. The present study investigated the bacterial distribution in a plateau freshwater lake, Erhai Lake (southwestern China), and its upslope soils. Illumina MiSeq sequencing illustrated high bacterial diversity in lake sediments and soils. Sediment and soil bacterial communities were mainly composed of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes. However, a distinctive difference in bacterial community structure was found between soil and sediment ecosystems. Water content, nitrogen and pH affected the distribution of the bacterial community across Erhai Lake and its upslope soils. Moreover, the soil bacterial community might also be shaped by plant types. This work could provide some new insights into plateau aquatic and terrestrial microbial ecology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20160701927753,,"Chen, Yihui (1); Dai, Yu (2); Wang, Yilin (3); Wu, Zhen (3); Xie, Shuguang (2); Liu, Yong (3) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China (2) State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (3) Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (Ministry of Education), College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China ",,454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics,,,,,Ecology - Lakes - Moisture - Sediments - Soils - Water,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xie, Shuguang(xiesg@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jes.2015.08.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18787320,"Number: 14Y02ESPCP, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB458900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41571444, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51279001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41571444 , 51279001 ), the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2015CB458900 ), and the Special Fund of State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control (No. 14Y02ESPCP ).

J. Biobased Mater. Bioenergy,"In order to study the effect of pyrolysis temperature on physical and chemical characteristics of bio-oil and bio-char, Yunnan pine pyrolysis was conducted on a fixed-bed reactor. The components of bio-oil obtained were analyzed by GC-MS, while the functional group, crystal structure and micro morphology of bio-char by FTIR, XRD, and SEM respectively. The ultimate analysis and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-char and bio-oil were also determined. The results indicated that low pyrolysis temperatures resulted in more char, while high pyrolysis temperatures inclined to yield more gaseous products. The higher pyrolysis temperature made the contents of the esters and alcohols higher but ketones and acids lower in the bio-oil. The increase of temperature led to significant decrease of carbon and hydrogen as well as prominent increase of oxygen. Moreover, higher temperature led to the reduction of HHV of bio-oil simultaneously. High pyrolysis temperature contributed to the decline and disappearance of -OH, -C = C-, and -C-O- in bio-char. When the pyrolysis temperature exceeded 400°C, a structure resembling graphite crystallite developed. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the contents of oxygen and hydrogen dramatically decreased in bio-char. The higher heating value (HHV) of bio-char augmented with the increase of temperature.

Themicro-morphologies of LMO-T are strongly influencedby thetemplate.TemplatedLiMn2O4shows a flake-like and porous structure, and the particles of LMO-T with a size of ∼100 nm are uniform and well dispersed. Differently, LMO exhibits a thick layer or bulk and badly agglomeratedmorphologies. Templated LiMn2O4exhibits significantly improved electrochemical performance, especially rate capability, compared with LMO, due to its better crystallinity, lower polarisation and lower charge transfer resistance. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,20161802331854,,"Liu, G.

Tumu Gongcheng Xuebao,"Shaking table tests were carried out for a 3.8 m×3.6 m×3.9 m (length×width× height) full-scale two-storey Chinese traditional wood structure attached with viscoelastic dampers. To study the seismic performance of Chinese traditional wood structure with and without viscoelastic dampers, they were tested under the peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 0. 07g and 0. 4g, respectively. The experimental results show that after attaching the viscoelastic dampers, the stiffness of mortise-tenon joints can be greatly increased so that rotation capability of the semi-rigid joints can be decreased, and the deformation restoring capacity of the structure model can be greatly enhanced. After experiencing multiple repeated earthquakes, there was no obvious tilt damages in the structure model even for 0.95 g PGA. Shock absorption of mortise-tenon joints at the top of columns of the first floor firstly came into play. The dynamic amplification factor may decrease with the increase of the input seismic excitation. Due to the non-uniform distribution of mass and stiffness in two directions of structure model, the dynamic amplification factors in X and Y directions of the structure model were different, since the dynamic amplification factors in X and Y directions may vary in the range of 1.2519~0.7775 and 1.8779~1.1152, respectively. Mortise-tenon joints of structure model with attached viscoelastic dampers, the purposes of decreasing the story drift in small earthquakes and enhancing the deformation restoring capability of joints in strong earthquakes can be realized. © 2016, Editorial Office of China Civil Engineering Journal.

The cosegmentation method uses an auxiliary dataset and is implemented with three steps: superpixel grouping, E-SVM classifier training, and segmentation propagation. Firstly, image input by user is segmented in superpixel, such that the images in auxiliary dataset can be divided into multi-regions. Secondly, some regions are selected to a positive segmentation and HOG information is used to train E-SVM classifiers. Finally, the cloth is segmented into user image with E-SVM classifiers and segmentation propagation.

TMS Light Met.,"Spray deposition and continuous extrusion (SD-CE) forming technique is a novel technology that combines spray forming and continuous extrusion. Al-20Si alloy rods with a diameter of 8 mm have been fabricated using SD-CE with different extrusion ratios. The microstructure and mechanical properties of these alloy rods were investigated. Al- 20Si alloy can be refined effectively by SD-CE, resulting in a great improvement of mechanical properties.

Water Sci. Technol.,"Straws of four ornamental flowers (carnation, rose, lily, and violet) were added into denitrification biofilters using gravel as matrix through vertically installed perforated polyvinylchloride pipes to provide organic carbon for the treatment of nitrate-contaminated wastewater operating in batch mode. Removal efficiencies of nitrate and phosphate, as well as temporal variations of nitrogen and carbon during batches 10 and 19, were investigated and assessed. Nitrate removal was efficiently enhanced by the addition of flower straws, but decreased gradually as the organic substances were consumed. Phosphate removal was also improved, although this very limited. High nitrate removal rates were achieved during the initial 12 h in the two batches each lasting for 3 days, along with the depletion of influent dissolved oxygen due to aerobic degradation of the organic compounds. NO2--N of 0.01-2.83 mg/L and NH4+-N of 0.02-1.69 mg/L were formed and both positively correlated to the nitrate reduced. Inorganic carbon (IC) concentrations increased during the batches and varied conversely with the nitrate contents, and could be indicative of nitrate removal due to the highly significant positive correlation between NO3--N removed and IC concentration (r2= 0.881, p © 2016 IWA Publishing.",,20163002648789,,"Chang, Junjun (1); Ma, Luyao (1); Zhou, Yuanyang (1); Zhang, Shenghua (2); Wang, Weilu (1) ","(1) Research Institute of Engineering and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) College of Resources and Environmental Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan; 430074, China ",WSTED4,452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Biofilters - Denitrification - Dissolved oxygen - Integrated circuits - Nitrates - Organic carbon - Wastewater treatment,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Shenghua(zhangshenghua@yahoo.com) ",10.2166/wst.2016.163,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 201401, Acronym: City, Sponsor: City, University of London; Number: 2014FB105, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Hebei Province Science and Technology Support Program; Number: 51408531, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this work from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51408531), the Project of Science and Technology Program of Yunnan Province, China (2013FD006, 2014FB105), and the Special Project of Science and Technology Program of Chenggong District of Kunming City, China (201401).",,02731223,2,July 2016,English,Nitrogen removal,,29.0,416-423,,2016,"IWA Publishing, 12 Caxton Street, London, SW1H 0QS, United Kingdom",Water Science and Technology,,Remediation of nitrate-contaminated wastewater using denitrification biofilters with straws of ornamental flowers added as carbon source,,Aerobic degradation - Contaminated wastewater - Nitrate removal - Phosphate removal - Positive correlations - Removal efficiencies - Solid carbon sources - Temporal variation,74
Recent Adv. Electr. Electron. Eng.,"Background: To make up for the deficiency existing in single method for transformer fault diagnosis, a model of multi-algorithm fusion based on improved Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory was proposed through analyzing the implementation process of quantum particle swarm optimized BP neural network (QPSO-BP). Methods: According to the failure modes of transformer, the primary fault diagnosis was achieved using a model group formed by several single methods, such as QPSO-BP, the inertia weight PSO optimized BP network (IWPSO-BP) and the constriction factor PSO optimized BP network (CFPSO- BP), then the fusion decision was implemented by D-S theory. In view of the defect of standard D-S which can not synthesize the highly conflicting evidences, the credibility factor was used to improve the capability of information fusion. Results: Diagnostic results show that, compared with the single models and standard D-S, the proposed method has stronger fault tolerance, and improves the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis. Conclusion: The method based on the multi-algorithm fusion can enhance effectively the diagnostic efficacy, and suitable for the pattern recognition of transformer fault. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",,20170903395394,,"Jiatang, Cheng (1); Li, Ai (1); Yan, Xiong (1) ","(1) The Engineering College of Honghe University, Yunnan, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 921.1 Algebra - 961 Systems Science",,,,,Backpropagation - Decision theory - Failure analysis - Fault tolerance - Group theory - Neural networks - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Pattern recognition,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jiatang, Cheng(chjt@163.com) ",10.2174/2352096509666161115143928,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),23520973,"Number: 51669006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to thank the Editor in Chief, the Associate Editor, and the reviewers for their very helpful comments and suggestions.

Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"The optimal operation of large scale cascaded hydropower plants involves more and more high comprehensive utilization requirements. The contradiction between peak load regulation and navigation has been one of serious problems facing the rivers with navigation demand. Taking Jinghong and Ganlanba cascaded hydropower stations on the Lancang River as the background, a hybrid search method for multi-objective optimization operations of cascaded hydropower plants with peak load regulation and navigation demands was proposed. The objective of the method is to minimize the residual load's maximum of the power grid and the variance of tail water levels of the downstream hydropower station. Furthermore, this method introduced some solution strategies to deal with complex temporal coupling constraints, including generation ramping constraints, generation fluctuation limit and minimum continuous time-steps of operation and shutdown, and the specified level control targets in the solution process of the NSGA-II in order to improve the search efficiency of the method and obtain the practical and rational results. The results show that our method can meet the demands for peak load regulation and navigation simultaneously. Thus it is concluded that the proposed method is feasible and practical. © 2016 Chin.

Wuhan Daxue Xuebao Xinxi Kexue Ban,"Using zero drift correction for single survey line data and a scale factor change detection method, we carried out fine processing of CG-5 gravimeter from dual survey observation data during 2014 for the Yunnan area; gravity variations in the area were obtained. The results show that: (1) a zero drift rate of CG-5 gravimeter varies significantly over time. In the first survey period, the zero drift rate of gravimeter C1169 and C1170 present a tendency of linear increase at a magnitude of 20×10-8m·s-2·h-1variation. During the second survey period, the zero drift rate of the gravimeters tended to be stable. After zero drift correction, the observation precision improved substantially. (2) The scale factor of the C1170 gravimeter changed at a magnitude of -0.000 100. (3)After scale factor correction, the gravity variation showed a better agreement with the absolute observation result, and the gravity variation image can clearly reflect the difference between the two sides of the Zhaotong-Ludian faults and seismogenic background of the Ludian 6.5 earthquake, which verified the view that a large earthquake occurred in the positive-negative transition area of gravity variation.

Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol.,"In the present study, the culture conditions for the accumulation of Glycyrrhiza uralensis adventitious root metabolites in balloon-type bubble bioreactors (BTBBs) have been optimized. The results of the culture showed that the best culture conditions were a cone angle of 90° bioreactor and 0.4–0.6–0.4-vvm aeration volume. Aspergillus niger can be used as a fungal elicitor to enhance the production of defense compounds in plants. With the addition of a fungal elicitor (derived from Aspergillus niger), the maximum accumulation of total flavonoids (16.12 mg g−1) and glycyrrhetinic acid (0.18 mg g−1) occurred at a dose of 400 mg L−1of Aspergillus niger resulting in a 3.47-fold and 1.8-fold increase over control roots. However, the highest concentration of polysaccharide (106.06 mg g−1) was achieved with a mixture of elicitors (Aspergillus niger and salicylic acid) added to the medium, resulting in a 1.09-fold increase over Aspergillus niger treatment alone. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MSn) analysis was performed, showing that seven compounds were present after treatment with the elicitors, including uralsaponin B, licorice saponin B2, liquiritin, and (3R)-vestitol, only identified in the mixed elicitor treatment group. It has also been found that elicitors (Aspergillus niger and salicylic acid) significantly upregulated the expression of the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), β-amyrin synthase (β-AS), squalene epoxidase (SE) and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP72A154) genes, which are involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) activity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,20154401451608,,"Li, Jing (1, 2); Wang, Juan (1); Li, Jinxin (1); Liu, Dahui (3); Li, Hongfa (1); Gao, Wenyuan (1); Li, Jianli (4); Liu, Shujie (4) ","(1) Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin; 300072, China (2) State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing; 100700, China (3) Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yunnan; 650231, China (4) Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin; 300457, China ",,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Biochemistry - Bioreactors - Biosynthesis - Electrospray ionization - Enzymes - Gene expression - Genes - Mass spectrometry - Metabolites - Salicylic acid,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gao, Wenyuan(biochemgao@163.com) ",10.1007/s12010-015-1895-5,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15590291,,,,02732289,3,"February 1, 2016",English,Aspergillus,,55.0,576-593,,2016,Humana Press Inc.,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,,Aspergillus niger Enhance Bioactive Compounds Biosynthesis As Well As Expression of Functional Genes in Adventitious Roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch,,Adventitious root - Aspergillus niger - Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase - Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry - Glycyrrhiza uralensis - Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch - HPLC-ESI MS - Superoxide dismutases,178
Front. Environ. Sci. Eng.,"To enhance the effectiveness of watershed load reduction decision making, the Risk Explicit Interval Linear Programming (REILP) approach was developed in previous studies to address decision risks and system returns. However, REILP lacks the capability to analyze the tradeoff between risks in the objective function and constraints. Therefore, a refined REILP model is proposed in this study to further enhance the decision support capability of the REILP approach for optimal watershed load reduction. By introducing a tradeoff factor (α) into the total risk function, the refined REILP can lead to different compromises between risks associated with the objective functions and the constraints. The proposed model was illustrated using a case study that deals with uncertainty-based optimal load reduction decision making for Lake Qionghai Watershed, China. A risk tradeoff curve with different values of α was presented to decision makers as a more flexible platform to support decision formulation. The results of the standard and refined REILP model were compared under 11 aspiration levels. The results demonstrate that, by applying the refined REILP, it is possible to obtain solutions that preserve the same constraint risk as that in the standard REILP but with lower objective risk, which can provide more effective guidance for decision makers. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20153201127882,,"Yang, Pingjian (1, 2); Dong, Feifei (1); Liu, Yong (1, 3); Zou, Rui (4); Chen, Xing (1); Huaicheng, Guo (1) ","(1) College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Peking University, the Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences, Ministry of Education, Beijing; 100871, China (2) School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; MI; 48109, United States (3) Yunnan International Center for Pleantu Lakes, Kunming; 650034, China (4) Tetra Tech, Inc, Fairfax; VA; 22030, United States ",,444.1 Surface Water - 912.2 Management - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Decision making - Decision support systems - Lakes - Linear programming - Uncertainty analysis - Watersheds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huaicheng, Guo(hcguo@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11783-014-0683-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),2095221X,,,,20952201,1,"February 1, 2016",English,Risk assessment,,35.0,129-140,,2016,Higher Education Press,Frontiers of Environmental Science and Engineering,,A refined risk explicit interval linear programming approach for optimal watershed load reduction with objective-constraint uncertainty tradeoff analysis,,aspiration level - Decision supports - Flexible platforms - Interval linear programming - Objective functions - objective-constraint uncertainty tradeoff - Risk trade-offs - Trade-off analysis,10
Sci. China Earth Sci.,"Based on calculations of the tidal Coulomb failure stress and investigations of the correlation between the Earth tide and the Ning’er earthquake sequence, the processes of fault nucleation and failure were simulated. In these simulations we consider the influence of tidal stresses using the rate- and state-dependent friction laws. Furthermore, the effects on tidal triggering due to the stress amplitude and periodic oscillation properties were investigated, and the triggering effects between the tidal normal and tidal shear stresses were compared. The results showed that the Ning’er earthquake sequence was a physical consequence of tidal effects. A transition period T0exists between the nucleation and failure processes of a seismic fault. When the period T of stress is equal to or becomes larger than T0, the fault response becomes dependent on the periodic features of the loading stress; however, for T 0, the response of the fault is nearly independent of the period. Both the tidal normal and tidal shear stresses have similar effect in the nucleation and failure processes; the clock changes generally increase with the maximum amplitudes of the tidal stresses. Tidal normal and tidal shear stresses with positive amplitudes mainly induce earthquake triggering; however, the triggering effects induced by negative tidal stresses are smaller and faults are not sensitive to negative tidal stresses. Our results primarily reveal the physical mechanisms of tidal stress triggering. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20152700988322,,"Xie, ChaoDi (1); Lei, XingLin (2); Wu, XiaoPing (1); Fu, Hong (3); Xiong, ZiYao (1); Hu, XiongLin (3); Li, Sha (1) ","(1) Geophysics Department, School of Resources & Earth Science, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Geological Survey of Japan, AIST, Tsukuba; 305-8567, Japan (3) Earthquake Administration of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650224, China ",,"484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth",,,,,Earthquakes - Friction - Nucleation - Shear flow - Shear stress,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xie, ChaoDi(xiecd@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11430-015-5109-3,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18691897,"Number: 2014Z009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2013CK002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41004021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41104036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We appreciate the help of Naoyuki Kato.

BioResour.,"The film-forming ability of bagasse hemicellulose and its potential for packaging were investigated in terms of its mechanical and water vapor barrier properties. The films were prepared under various hemicellulose concentrations, chitosan/glycerol amounts (based on the amount of hemicellulose), and temperatures. These were subsequently evaluated by measurement of their mechanical and water vapor barrier properties. Bagasse hemicellulose-based films with higher tensile strengths were obtained at higher hemicellulose concentrations. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the bagasse hemicellulose-based films did not have pores less than one micron in size, suggesting compatibility between the hemicelluloses and the other components present in the films. Moreover, the tensile strength, elongation, and water vapor barrier of the film increased by approximately 124%, 115%, and 48%, respectively, when the drying temperature increased from 25 to 55 °C.

Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"To further understand the vibration mechanism of transformer winding, a 3D finite element model of some real transformer was built in the paper. The whole simulation of winding vibration response excited by eletro-dynamic force was made based on the magnetic-mechanical coupling field theory. During the calculation process, the Mooney-Rivlin model was applied to simulate the nonlinear material characteristics of winding block to accurately improve the simulation results. The vibration signals of some 35 kV power transformer were measured. It is shown that the simulated vibration waveforms of transformer winding are matched well with the measured results by the optical vibration sensor which is deployed on the surface of transformer winding. Hence, the effectiveness of the finite element model of transformer winding is verified. In addition, when the winding is loosened, the stiffness of block is increased, as well as the 100 Hz component and its multiple frequency in vibration signals. However, the increments of 100 Hz component and its multiple frequencies in vibration signals are different.

Comput Syst Sci Eng,"The ambiguity problem is widely distributed in Vietnamese sentences and impacts the accuracy of word segmentation. In this paper, we proposed a Vietnamese word segmentation method based on CRF (Condition Random Field) and cross ambiguity models, which we combined with Vietnamese lexical features to incorporate essential characteristics of Vietnamese into Condition Random Fields. Overall, 5377 ambiguity fragments were extracted from the training corpus, selected statistical features, ambiguity field internal features and ambiguity contextual features and placed into the maximum entropy model and cross ambiguity model, and then incorporated into the segmentation model. The training corpus is divided into ten copies evenly for the cross validation experiment; the segmentation accuracy reached 96.55%. And compared with the Vietnamese segmentation tool,VnTokenizer, the experimental results suggest that our proposed method for Vietnamese segmentation performs well and is precise.

Int. J. Food Prop.,"Gallic acid is one of the important polyphenols in plants and it inhibits α-amylase. The interaction between gallic acid and α-amylase was investigated by fluorescence quenching spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, synchronous spectroscopy, and the three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy under mimic physiological conditions. The result of the emission quenching at different temperatures revealed that there are static quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of α-amylase induced by gallic acid and a complex of gallic acid-α-amylase was formed. The results obtained from the evaluation of three-dimensional fluorescence spectra, UV-vis spectra, and synchronous spectra suggested that the association between gallic acid and α-amylase did change the molecular conformation of α-amylase. Gallic acid can enter the primary substrate-binding pocket and alter the microenvironment around tryptophan and tyrosine residues.

The dielectric properties were measured by microwave cavity perturbation method. The dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor of the CuCl residue have a linear correlation with the moisture content. With this relationship, we can realize on-line measurement of moisture content of the CuCl residue by dielectric properties. The microwave drying experiments with different thicknesses (1-5cm) of CuCl residue were carried out, and the heating curve of the materials under different microwave powers (250-450W) was made.

"Proc. Int. Conf. Cloud Comput. Internet Things, CCIOT","In order to solve the problem of PCNN with improper parameter selection and determination of circulation iterations which leads to the image owe-segmentation or over-segmentation, an Iterative Self-organizing Data Clustering (ISODC) model is used in this paper to resolve the problems of the PCNN parameters selection and requiring multiple circulation. By using ISODC clustering search decision-making ability, the best threshold value is obtained. ISODC can solve the dilemma that PCNN needs to determine appropriate model parameters and circulation iterations. ISODC-PCNN makes use of the grey level of the image to cluster, and then uses the improved ISODATA to determine the initial number and the center of clustering which can be used as the optimal threshold value of PCNN. Therefore ISODC-PCNN can automatically segment an image with one time of iteration.

Huanjing Kexue,"In order to reveal the effect of aquatic plants distribution on the mass concentration of phosphorus in sediment interstitial water, the mass concentrations of Dissolved Total Phosphorus (DTP), Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP) and Dissolved Organic Phosphorus (DOP) in the sediment interstitial water and overlying water from areas with or without plants in the same site of Dianchi were studied. The vertical variation characteristics of phosphorus forms in sediment interstitial water were analyzed to explore the effect of aquatic plants on the phosphorus forms in sediment interstitial water. The results showed: Aquatic plants had an significant effect on the phosphorus mass concentration of the sediment interstitial water in different Dianchi lakes. However, they varied with different distribution sites and depth. Aquatic plants significantly decreased the percentage of DOP contribution in the sediment interstitial water. The average contribution of DOP with aquatic plants was 32.87%, while that without plants reached 57.68%; Aquatic plants significantly inhibited the release of inorganic phosphorus in sediments and promoted the transformation of DOP. The SRP diffusion flux at sediment-water interface with aquatic plants was increased by 39.99% as compared with that without plants; (4)The growth of aquatic plants significantly reduced the concentration of phosphorus in sediment interstitial water, especially DOP, and the reduction rate of the sediment interstitial water DOP was from 38.02% to 85.49%. Therefore, the analysis of the contribution and reduction rate of aquatic plants on the sediment interstitial water DOP was of great importance in understanding the relationship between aquatic plants and DOP, as well as the mineralization of organic phosphorus in sediments. © 2016, Science Press.

Math. Probl. Eng.,"The recycling of waste products can sharply save manufacturing cost and improve the economic efficiency and corporate-reputation. It also has a great effect on the environment and resources protection. In the management of the closed-loop supply chain, the recycling of waste products and decision-making on pricing often directly affect the supply and demand of products and the operation efficiency of supply chain. Therefore, first we take waste glass bottles as an example and establish a mathematical model to solve the profit of manufacturers and retailers solely. Then, we analyzed whole supply chain profit under a dual-channel recycling condition which is directly recycled by consumers or by retailers. Finally, we concluded that no matter what product's price, quality, profit, or operational efficiency of supply chain is, the overall recycling is better than the single node recycling model. Based on the analysis, we developed a new model to coordinate the profit of manufacturers and retailers in the supply chain with revenue-sharing contract. A numerical study shows that this approach is applicable and effective. © 2016 Wenxue Ran et al.",Open Access,20162302470494,1049514.0,"Ran, Wenxue (1); Chen, Fan (1); Wu, Qianni (1); Liu, Sen (1) ","(1) School of Logistics, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China ",,452.3 Industrial Wastes - 812.3 Glass - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 912 Industrial Engineering and Management - 912.2 Management - 913 Production Planning and Control; Manufacturing - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Costs - Decision making - Efficiency - Glass - Profitability - Recycling - Sales - Supply chains - Waste management,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Sen(liusencool@gmail.com) ",10.1155/2016/1049514,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15635147,,,,1024123X,,2016,English,Glass bottles,,20.0,,,2016,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,A Study of the Closed-Loop Supply Chain Coordination on Waste Glass Bottles Recycling,,Closed-loop supply chain - Corporate reputations - Economic efficiency - Manufacturing cost - Operation efficiencies - Operational efficiencies - Recycling of wastes - Revenue sharing contracts,2016

IEEE Trans. Neural Networks Learn. Sys.,"Among a number of ensemble learning techniques, boosting and bagging are the most popular sampling-based ensemble approaches for classification problems. Boosting is considered stronger than bagging on noise-free data set with complex class structures, whereas bagging is more robust than boosting in cases where noise data are present. In this paper, we extend both ensemble approaches to clustering tasks, and propose a novel hybrid sampling-based clustering ensemble by combining the strengths of boosting and bagging. In our approach, the input partitions are iteratively generated via a hybrid process inspired by both boosting and bagging. Then, a novel consensus function is proposed to encode the local and global cluster structure of input partitions into a single representation, and applies a single clustering algorithm to such representation to obtain the consolidated consensus partition. Our approach has been evaluated on 2-D-synthetic data, collection of benchmarks, and real-world facial recognition data sets, which show that the proposed technique outperforms the existing benchmarks for a variety of clustering tasks. © 2015 IEEE.",,20153901301924,7112527.0,"Yang, Yun (1); Jiang, Jianmin (2, 3) ","(1) National Pilot School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Research Institute of Future Media Computing, School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen; 518060, China (3) Department of Computing, University of Surrey, Guildford; GU27XH, United Kingdom ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,Cluster analysis - Face recognition - Iterative methods - Sampling - Unsupervised learning,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2430821,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),21622388,"Number: 61402397, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61373103, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61373103 and Grant 61402397.,,2162237X,5,May 2016,English,Clustering algorithms,,61.0,952-965,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,,Hybrid Sampling-Based Clustering Ensemble with Global and Local Constitutions,,Cluster structure - Clustering Ensemble - Consensus clustering - Consensus functions - Data clustering - Ensemble approaches - Facial recognition - Single clustering algorithms,27
Int J Hydrogen Energy,"For a sustainable society, it is highly desirable to produce H2from renewable sources and with low energy consumption. Functional, cheap and easy-prepared Mg2AlNiXHZOYnano-oxyhydrides materials were successfully developed from Mg2AlNiXOYnano-composites ex-hydrotalcites. After an in situ treatment in H2at low temperature (450 °C), the Mg2AlNiXOYnano-composites (x > 1) become hydrogen reservoirs, called oxyhydrides, with the presence of hydrogen species of hydride nature that can be stored in the anionic vacancies of the solid. Advanced techniques in presence of H2including TPR, in situ XRD and INS were used to study the nano-composites with different Ni contents. The Mg2AlNiXHZOYnano-oxyhydrides (x > 1) are shown to be able to simultaneously provide hydride species and to totally convert ethanol and produce H2from a water-ethanol mixture in presence of O2, with very low energy input. In complement to the exothermic partial oxidation reaction, the chemical energy delivered from the strong exothermic reaction between hydride species and O2is used. The reaction is sustainable because hydride species are replaced and provided by ethanol. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.",,20161902366552,,"Fang, Wenhao (1, 2); Pirez, Cyril (1); Paul, Sébastien (1); Jiménez-Ruiz, Mónica (3); Jobic, Hervé (4); Dumeignil, Franck (1); Jalowiecki-Duhamel, Louise (1) ","(1) Univ.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"By adopting inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) combined with chemometric analysis technology, 23 kinds of minerals in four kinds of characteristic honey derived from Yunnan province were analyzed. The result showed that 21 kinds of mineral elements, namely Na, Mg, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Tl and Pb, have significant differences among different varieties of honey. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the cumulative variance contribution rate of the first four main components reached 77.74%, seven kinds of elements (Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Sr, Cd, Ba) from the first main component contained most of the honey information. Through the stepwise discriminant analysis, seven kinds of elements (Mg, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Sr, Pb) were filtered out and used to establish the discriminant function model, and the correct classification rates of the proposed model reached 90% and 86.7%, respectively, which showed elements contents could be effectively indicators to discriminate the four kinds characteristic honey in southern Yunnan Province. In view of all the honey samples were harvested from apiaries located at south Yunnan Province where have similar climate, soil and other environment conditions, the differences of the mineral elements contents for the honey samples mainly due to their corresponding nectariferous plant.

Huagong Jinzhan/Chem. Ind. Eng. Prog.,"The experimental analysis of polluting emission characteristics of waste lithium-cobalt and lithium iron battery under different heat treatment conditions, which including the different temperature, time, gas, and inputs, was conducted in this paper. The experiment process contains from samples collection, discharge processing, dismantling and composition analysis, until heat treatment and sampling analysis. The experimental results showed that the optimum temperature for heat treatment of waste lithium iron battery is 600, at which the metal recycling rate is the highest. The recycling rate of lithium, cobalt, copper, aluminum in lithium-cobalt battery is 95.38%, 93.99%, 96.24%, and 85.28%, respectively. The recycling rate of lithium, iron, copper, aluminum in lithium iron battery is 90.01%, 85.49%, 83.72%, 73.75%, respectively. Different composition of gas-intake will affect the heat treatment and metal recycling rate, but the gap is small. Taking the operating costs and metal recycling rate into consideration, air is the best among the three different heat treatment gases. In waste gas, the concentration of HCl and HF is about two to sixteen per million, so a special attention is needed to pay to get rid of acidic gas in the recycling process. Metal gas-solid phase distribution although the content of gas phase metal has a rising trend with the operation temperature increase, but the proportion is extremely low. © 2016, Chemical Industry Press.

Kexue Tongbao/Chin. Sc. Bull.,"Solar granulation is a plasma convective phenomenon from the solar convection zone to the photosphere, which appears as a cellular pattern on the solar surface. Morphological characteristics and evolution process of granules can help us to better understand the mechanism of the convective motion and the relationship to solar magnetic field. Therefore, an accurate identification method is crucial to study the mechanism and relationship. However, the traditional identification methods based on intensity- and gradient-threshold are very difficult to identify granules because the intensity distribution of granules is non-uniform and their boundaries appear to be blurred. In this paper, we proposed a new method based on phase congruency to identify granules and analyzed their morphological characteristics. The identification procedure includes three steps: (1) obtaining phase congruency feature from an original image; (2) obtaining binary image of phase congruency feature; (3) morphological filter to extract granule shapes. We selected two high-resolution image sequences taken from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) at Fuxian Solar Observatory (FSO) to illustrate the identification procedure. For evaluating the accuracy of the proposed method, two traditional methods based on intensity threshold and marked watershed were compare to our method. Furthermore, we also selected three different thresholds to inspect the influence. The experiment result demonstrates that our proposed method is effective and accurate, and insensitive to those selected threshold. This demonstrates that our proposed method can be used to study granules evolution and their physical mechanism. Using the method, a total of 165694 and 108279 granules were identified from the first and the second data sets, respectively. The diameter of each granule was first obtained, and then their distributions were exhibited. We found that the distributions of granules from the two data sets hold two obvious peaks, implying that the granules hold two different scales, and are called: mini granules whose diameters are smaller than 780 km and regular granules greater than 780 km. The four properties of the granules: diameter, mean intensity, ratio of long axis to short one, and fractal dimension were obtained from the two classes. The mean intensity of mini and regular granules approximates 1.04 times than the corresponding mean photosphere intensity. This suggests that there is no difference between mini and regular granules to the intensity feature. The ranges of the ratio of long to short axis are between 1.6-1.8, indicating that the shape of the granules seem to be elongated rather than circular. The fractal dimension of mini and regular granules is calculated by the logarithm ratio perimeter to area. The results of mini and regular granules are 1.30 and 1.50 on the first data sets and 1.24 and 1.32 on the second one, respectively. The results indicate that the fractal dimensions of the granules around sunspots range between 1.24-1.5. © 2016, Science Press.

Zhongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban),"Different joint restore strategies of the old cement concrete pavement were investigated to validate the availability on the reflection-crack resistance in the asphalt concrete(AC) layer through beam tests. In this research, three repaired materials, i.e. cement concrete (CC), engineered cementitious composite (ECC) and ECC-dowel combination were used. The crack development and flexural performance of the different composite beams were investigated by three-point-bending test and SEM. The results show that there are obvious differences in the development of the cracks between ECC and CC composite beams. ECC can effectively prevent the reflection crack due to its ductility characteristics as strain hardening and multipoint cracking. Bridging between the fibers in ECC matrix is crucial for the flexural performance of composite beam while dowel bar contribution can be neglected. © 2016, Central South University of Technology.

J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol.,"For this paper, YPO4: Tm, Yb inverse opals with the photonic band gaps at 475 nm and 655 nm were prepared by polystyrene colloidal crystal templates. We investigated the influence of photonic band gaps on the Tm-Yb upconversion emission which was in the YPO4: Tm Yb inverse opal photonic crystals. Comparing with the reference sample, significant suppression of both the blue and red upconversion luminescence of Tm3+ ions were observed in the inverse opals. The color purity of the blue emission was improved in the inverse opal by the suppression of red upconversion emission. Additionally, mechanism of upconversion emission in the inverse opal was discussed. We believe that the present work will be valuable for not only the foundational study of upconversion emission modification but also the development of new optical devices in upconversion lighting and display.

Light Met. 2016,"In this research, thermodynamic analysis and CASTEP package of the Material Studio program which is based on density functional theory (DFT) formalism were used to study the carbothermic-chlorination (AlCl3) reaction of Al2O under vacuum Thermodynamic calculations indicated that AlCl(g) can be generated by carbothermic-chlorination process at 1760K and 60Pa. The interaction of Al2O and AlCl3 with C showed that the chemical adsorption of Al2O and AlCl3 did take place on C(001) crystal plane, at the same time, new chemical bond have been formed between Al atom dissociated from Al2O and Cl atom dissociated from AlCl3 molecule. The result, after 1ps dynamics simulation, indicated that adsorbed AlCl and CO molecules have been generated in Al2O-AlCl3-C system, and they would escape from C surface after a longer period of dynamics simulation time. It means that the reaction of Al2O and AlCl3 with C can be carried out under given constraint condition. © 2016 by The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.

Lignin removal for O2-NaOH pretreatment was around 10% higher than that for sole NaOH pretreatment under the same conditions, and O2-NaOH pretreatment resulted in higher glucan recovery in the solid remain. Subsequently, O2-NaOH pretreated sugarcane bagasse presented more efficient enzymatic digestibility than sole NaOH pretreatment. Under the moderate pretreatment conditions of combining 1% NaOH and 0.5 MPa O2at 80 °C for 120 min, a high glucan conversion of 95% was achieved after 48 h enzymatic hydrolysis. Coupled with the operations of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, an admirable total sugar recovery of 89% (glucose recovery of 93% and xylose recovery of 84%) was obtained.

Neurocomputing,"Kernel canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a powerful statistical tool characterizing nonlinear relations between two sets of multidimensional variables. It has been widely used in many branches of science and technology, e.g. bioinfomatics, multi-media information retrieval, cross-language document retrieval, fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Previous algorithms focus on sparsity analysis of kernel CCA. In this paper, from another viewpoint, we address a new gradient descent kernel CCA algorithm, which is based on the relation between kernel CCA and linear systems of equations. Meanwhile, stability analysis of the algorithm is addressed by means of suitable error decomposition formula and compact operator theory. Theoretical analysis is elegantly investigated in terms of choices of regularization parameter and step size. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for content-based image retrieval task.

In this method, a new magnetic adsorbent of molecularly imprinted polymers/magnetic nanoparticles prepared by simple physical blending was adopted, which enabled magnetic solid-phase extraction. Thus, the resultant material can be separated from the solvent rapidly and conveniently by a magnet. Two kinds of molecularly imprinted polymer/magnetic nanoparticles materials were fabricated, and the characteristics of materials such as the ratio, pH, amount, desorption, and regeneration were investigated. The analytes were quantified by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer operating in multiple reaction monitoring modes. The detection limit of the method was 0.003–0.3 μg/L, and the detection capability was 0.01–0.3 μg/L. The recoveries of these compounds were 65.7–114% at three spiked levels.

Polym Compos,"Urea formaldehyde (UF) resins with varied molar ratio of formaldehyde (F) to urea (U), modified by ammonium pentaborate (APB) at different loading level, was analyzed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and evaluated via bonding properties of its glued plywood. The result indicated that a higher loading of APB made a slower gelling and improved the ΔE′ (the difference of storage modulus) of UF resin with F/U molar ratio of 1.8. Hexamethylenetetramine, generated from the ammonium ion in APB and formaldehyde in UF resin and characterized by the covalent bond connections, was considered as the main reason to improve the rigidity of the cured UF resin system. The bond strength result confirmed the DMA analysis that the addition of APB improved bonding performance of UF resin with higher F/U molar ratio such as 1.8. A specific recommendation loading level of APB was made to modify UF resins, of which 6.0 to 8.0% APB should be used to modify UF resin with F/U molar ratio of 1.8, then 6% and 4% loading level of APB to UF resin with F/U molar ratio of 1.50 and 1.25, respectively. Finally, APB was n'ot suggested to modify UF resin at F/U molar ratio less than 1.20. POLYM.

Appl Therm Eng,"We propose a modified process for the massive production of polysilicon by directional solidification (DS) technology designed to change the currently used 'two-step DS process' into a 'single-step DS process', to enable the efficient production of polysilicon with lower energy and material consumption. The temperature distribution, solid-liquid (s/l) interface shapes, and thermal stresses during the DS process using the conventional process and the modified processes were studied by three-dimensional transient simulations. The simulation results about temperature, s/l interface, and thermal stresses were validated indirectly by corresponding experiments through the test for impurity segregation effect, minority carrier lifetime, and resistivity. It was found that the ingots produced by the modified process showed ideal solidification with uniform temperature distribution, slightly convex interface shapes, and lower thermal stresses, resulting in relatively higher carrier lifetimes and uniform distribution resistivity, which indicates that the single-step DS process is feasible to produce solar grade polysilicon. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Chin. Phys.,"To more in depth understand the doping effects of oxygen on SiGe alloys, both the micro-structure and properties of O-doped SiGe (including: bulk, (001) surface, and (110) surface) are calculated by DFT + U method in the present work. The calculated results are as follows. (i) The (110) surface is the main exposing surface of SiGe, in which O impurity prefers to occupy the surface vacancy sites. (ii) For O interstitial doping on SiGe (110) surface, the existences of energy states caused by O doping in the band gap not only enhance the infrared light absorption, but also improve the behaviors of photo-generated carriers. (iii) The finding about decreased surface work function of O-doped SiGe (110) surface can confirm previous experimental observations. (iv) In all cases, O doing mainly induces the electronic structures near the band gap to vary, but is not directly involved in these variations. Therefore, these findings in the present work not only can provide further explanation and analysis for the corresponding underlying mechanism for some of the experimental findings reported in the literature, but also conduce to the development of μc-SiGe-based solar cells in the future. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",,20164903094512,127101.0,"Zhao, Zong-Yan (1, 2); Yang, Wen (3); Yang, Pei-Zhi (3) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano Materials and Technology, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650504, China (3) Key Laboratory of Advanced Technique and Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",,741.1 Light/Optics - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Density functional theory - Electronic structure - Energy gap - Image enhancement - Light absorption,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Zong-Yan(zzy@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1088/1674-1056/25/12/127101,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20583834,,,,16741056,12,December 2016,English,Si-Ge alloys,,22.0,,,2016,Institute of Physics Publishing,Chinese Physics B,,Electronic structure of O-doped SiGe calculated by DFT + U method,,Dft + u - Doping effects - Infrared light - Photogenerated carriers - Surface vacancies - Surface work functions,25
Mater. Sci. Eng. C,"The formation of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene uses hydrothermal method with urea as reducing agent and nitrogen source. The surface elemental composition of the catalyst was analyzed through XPS, which showed a high content of a total N species (7.12 at.%), indicative of the effective N-doping, present in the form of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N groups. Moreover, Au nanoparticles deposited on ZnO nanocrystals surface, forming Au/ZnO hybrid nanocatalysts, undergo a super-hydrophobic to super-hydrophilic conversion. Herein, we present Au/ZnO hybrid nanocatalysts impregnated in N-doped graphene sheets through sonication technique of the Au/ZnO/N-doped graphene hybrid nanostructures. The as-prepared Au/ZnO/N-doped graphene hybrid nanostructure modified glassy carbon electrode (Au/ZnO/N-doped graphene/GCE) was first employed for the simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and acetaminophen (AC). The oxidation over-potentials of AA, DA and AC decreased dramatically, and their oxidation peak currents increased significantly at Au/ZnO/N-doped graphene/GCE compared to those obtained at the N-doped graphene/GCE and bare CCE. The peak separations between AA and DA, DA and AC, and AC and AA are large up to 195, 198 and 393 mV, respectively. The calibration curves for AA, DA and AC were obtained in the range of 30.00-13.00 × 103, 2.00-0.18 × 103and 5.00-3.10 × 103μM, respectively.

Shipin Kexue/Food Sc.,"This study comparatively evaluated the antioxidant activities of individual and combined anthocyanins extracted from the tubers of the red-skinned and red-fleshed potato variety 'Jianchuanhong' and the blue-skinned and blue-fleshed potato variety 'Zhuanxinwu', both of which are rich in anthocyanins as important natural antioxidants, with the aim of achieving better exploitation and utilization of these low-cost, easily available agricultural materials. The antioxidant activities were tested using four different in vitro models such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sμlphonate) radical (ABTS+·), hydroxyl (·OH) and superoxide anion free radical (O2-·) scavenging assays with vitamin C (VC) as a control. The results showed that anthocyanins extracted from 'Jianchuanhong' and 'Zhuanxinwu' potatoes had strong antioxidant activity in a concentration dependent manner and revealed a significant free radical scavenging capacity 10.7-31.3 times higher than that of VC. For both pigmented potato varieties, the capacity for scavenging four kinds of free radical revealed the following order: ABTS+· > DPPH radical > O2-· > ·OH. The antioxidant activity of anthocyanins from 'Zhuanxinwu' potato was better than that of 'Jianchuanhong' potato. Anthocyanins from both varieties, in combination, were not antagonistic but were synergistic in scavenging free radicals, and the synergistic effects against different free radicals were different. © 2016, China Food Publishing Company.

ECS J. Solid State Sci. Technol.,"The influence of the introduction of Li+ions on the upconversion (UC) properties of KLu2F7:Yb3+, Er3+nanocrystalline has been investigated in detail. It is found that the UC emission intensity of 10 mol% Li+ions doped KLu2F7:Yb3+, Er3+nanocrystalline is enhanced about 13 times in comparison with that of Li+-free sample. Under the excitation of 980 nm laser diode (LD), a significant improvement of the green to red emission ratio (GRR) in the 10 mol% Li+-doped sample is observed by increasing pump power density. Li+ions could occupy the cationic sites or the interstitial sites in the KLu2F7host matrix, which probably eliminate the defect states via the charge compensation and tailor of the crystal field, leading to the promotion of the UC emission efficiency. Thus, the introduction of Li+ions provides new opportunities for enhancing the scope of applications of Yb3+, Er3+doped KLu2F7nanocrystalline ranging from infrared solar cells to volumetric multiplexed bio-probe. © The Author(s) 2016.

J Rare Earth,"The upconversion (UC) of the rare earth doped glass-ceramics has been extensively investigated due to their potential applications in many fields, such as color display, high density memories, optical data storage, sensor and energy solar cell, etc. Many series of them, especially the oxyfluorides glasses containing Ba2LaF7nanocrystals were studied in this review work, due to the thermal and mechanical toughness, high optical transmittance from the ultraviolet to the infrared regions, and a low nonlinear refractive index compared to the other commercial laser glasses. Moreover, the energy transfer (ET) between the rare earth ions and transition metals plays an important role in the upconversion process. The cooperative ET has been researched very activly in UC glasses due to applications in the fields of solar cells, such as in the Er/Yb, Tm/Yb, Tb/Yb, Tb/Er/Yb and Tm/Er/Yb couples.

IEEE Antennas Wirel. Propag. Lett.,"It is a challenge to measure the antenna pattern of a large-sized radio telescope with a high resolution because it hardly rotates. This letter presents a simple and efficient method to measure the large-sized radio antenna pattern based on correlation techniques and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). We estimate the normalized pattern function of the electric field by utilizing correlation properties of the navigation signal in the auxiliary antenna and the radio antenna.

Int. J. Heat Mass Transf.,"There is a linear relationship between the flow patterns of a bubble swarm and heat transfer from the viewpoint of experimental analysis. To investigate the space-time features of the mixing process in a direct contact heat exchanger, uniformity coefficient (UC) method based on L2-star discrepancy (UC-LD) for assessing the mixing time of bubbles behind the viewing windows is effective. Although the UC makes a distinction between the local and global uniform with the same Betti number, the properties of UC have not been explored and there was a great influence of calculating initial position on the original UC, namely UC-LD. In this paper, we extend the UC-LD to the modified uniformity coefficient based on modified L2-star discrepancies such as centered discrepancy and wrap-around discrepancy. Uniformity coefficient based on centered discrepancy (UC-CD) and uniformity coefficient based on wrap-around discrepancy (UC-WD) theoretically satisfy a Koksma-Hlawka type inequality. Moreover, they exhibit some advantages such as permutation invariance, rotation invariance (reflection invariance) and the ability to measure projection uniformity. Real experimental cases are analyzed and simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed novel method. The study also find that UC-CD presents more sensitive performance than UC-WD finally, so we recommend using the former industrially. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J. Colloid Interface Sci.,"Amino-functionalized Fe3O4@SiO2magnetic nano-adsorbent was used as a novel sorbent to highly selective removal of Zn(II) ion from hot-dip galvanizing pickling waste in the presence of Fe(II). These hot-dip galvanizing pickling waste mainly contain ZnCl2and FeCl2in aqueous HCl media. The properties of this magnetic adsorbent were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and BET surface area measurements. Various factors influencing the adsorption of Zn(II) ion such as initial concentration of metal ions, the amount of adsorbent, pH value of the solutions, the concentration of coexisting iron ion were investigated by batch experiments. The results indicated that the adsorption equilibrium data obeyed the Freundlich model with maximum adsorption capacities for Zn(II) to 169.5mg/g. The maximum adsorption occurred at pH 5±0.1 and Fe(II) interferences had no obvious influence.

Sensors,"In a passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) system, tag collision is generally resolved on a medium access control (MAC) layer. However, some of collided tag signals could be recovered on a physical (PHY) layer and, thus, enhance the identification efficiency of the RFID system. For the recovery on the PHY layer, channel estimation is a critical issue. Good channel estimation will help to recover the collided signals. Existing channel estimates work well for two collided tags. When the number of collided tags is beyond two, however, the existing estimates have more estimation errors. In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimate for the UHF RFID system. It adopts an orthogonal matrix based on the information of preambles which is known for a reader and applies a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion to estimate channels. From the estimated channel, we could accurately separate the collided signals and recover them. By means of numerical results, we show that the proposed estimate has lower estimation errors and higher separation efficiency than the existing estimates. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Open Access,20161402181523,442.0,"Duan, Hanjun (1); Wu, Haifeng (1); Zeng, Yu (1); Chen, Yuebin (1) ","(1) School of Electrical and Information Technology, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming; 650500, China ",,"716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921.1 Algebra - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,Efficiency - Errors - Matrix algebra - Mean square error - Medium access control - Network layers - Radio frequency identification (RFID) - Recovery - Separation - Signal reconstruction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Haifeng(wuhaifeng@ynni.edu.cn) ",10.3390/s16040442,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014Z093, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2014HB019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61262091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61261022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was partially funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61262091 and No. 61261022, the Project of Scientific Research Foundation of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education under Grant No. 2014Z093, and the 17th batches of Young and Middle-aged Leaders in Academic and Technical Reserved Talents Project of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2014HB019",,14248220,4,"April 1, 2016",English,Channel estimation,,21.0,,,2016,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Sensors (Switzerland),,Ls channel estimation and signal separation for UHF RFID tag collision recovery on the physical layer,,Least Square - LS channel estimation - Medium access control layer - Minimum mean square error criterion - Separation efficiency - Signal separation - Tag collision - Ultra High Frequency (UHF),16

Biotechnol. Biofuels,"Background: The lignocellulose biorefinery based on the sugar platform usually focuses on polysaccharide bioconversion, while lignin is only burned for energy recovery. Pyrolysis can provide a novel route for the efficient utilization of residual lignin obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose. The pyrolysis characteristics of residual lignin are usually significantly affected by the pretreatment process because of structural alteration of lignin during pretreatment. In recent years, biological pretreatment using white-rot fungi has attracted extensive attention, but there are only few reports on thermal conversion of lignin derived from enzymatic hydrolysis residue (EHRL) of the bio-pretreated lignocellulose. Therefore, the study investigated the pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics of EHRL obtained from bamboo pretreated with Echinodontium taxodii in order to evaluate the potential of thermal conversion processes of EHRL. Results: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra showed that EHRL of bamboo treated with E. taxodii had the typical lignin structure, but aromatic skeletal carbon and side chain of lignin were partially altered by the fungus. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that EHRL pyrolysis at different heating rates could be divided into two depolymerization stages and covered a wide temperature range from 500 to 900 K. The thermal decomposition reaction can be well described by two third-order reactions. The kinetics study indicated that the EHRL of bamboo treated with white-rot fungus had lower apparent activation energies, lower peak temperatures of pyrolysis reaction, and higher char residue than the EHRL of raw bamboo. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was applied to characterize the fast pyrolysis products of EHRL at 600 °C. The ratios of guaiacyl-type to syringyl-type derivatives yield (G/S) and guaiacyl-type to p-hydroxy-phenylpropane-type derivatives yield (G/H) for the treated sample were increased by 33.18 and 25.30 % in comparison with the raw bamboo, respectively. Conclusions: The structural alterations of lignin during pretreatment can decrease the thermal stability of EHRL from the bio-treated bamboo and concentrate the guaiacyl-type derivatives in the fast pyrolysis products. Thus, the pyrolysis can be a promising route for effective utilization of the enzymatic hydrolysis residue from bio-pretreated lignocellulose. © 2016 Yan et al.",Open Access,20170103218438,76.0,"Yan, Keliang (1, 2); Liu, Fang (2); Chen, Qing (2); Ke, Ming (2); Huang, Xin (2); Hu, Weiyao (1); Zhou, Bo (1); Zhang, Xiaoyu (2); Yu, Hongbo (2) ","(1) Technology Center of China Tobacco, Yunnan Industrial Co., Ltd., Kunming; 650000, China (2) College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan; 430074, China ",,"641.1 Thermodynamics - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 811.1 Pulp and Paper - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives - 815.2 Polymerization - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity",,,,,Activation energy - Bamboo - Cellulose - Depolymerization - Enzymatic hydrolysis - Enzyme kinetics - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Gas chromatography - Kinetics - Lignin - Mass spectrometry - Reaction rates - Thermodynamic stability - Thermogravimetric analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Hongbo(yuhongbo@hust.edu.cn) ",10.1186/s13068-016-0489-y,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FL04, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012AA101805, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: HUST, Sponsor: Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Number: 2014CB138301, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the Research Foundation of Yunnan Tobacco Industry Co.

Int. Conf. Geoinformatics,"For sustainable economic development and urbanization in plateau lake basins, city planning needs to balance the tradeoff between urban growth and preservation of ecological environment by adopting intensive land use and maintaining sufficient open space. This research designs and evaluates four land use types in Dianchi Lake basin, Yunnan Province, China: development without constraints, ecologically constrained development, intensive land use development, and ecologically-constrained intensive land use development. The SLEUTH model is used to examine the four scenarios, and suggests that the ecologically constrained intensive land use development patterns outperform others. The scenario strikes a nice balance between the development across the whole urbanicity spectrum (i.e., City-Town-Village or CTV) and protecting the ecological environment in the Dianchi Lake basin.

The linear models required in the controller structures were extracted applying two identification alternatives. The GMC algorithm cases seem to guarantee more satisfactory end point quality of the process. However, only the DOA of the supersaturation manipulating the steam flowrate makes feasible all conflicting control objectives. © 2015 IEEE.",,20162902605144,7469016.0,"Niu, Lin (1) ","(1) Engineering College, Honghe University, Mongzi,Yunnan; 661100, China ",,723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 723.5 Computer Applications - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control,121826.0,"December 12, 2015 - December 13, 2015","Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China","8th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design, ISCID 2015",Artificial intelligence - Computer simulation - Parameter estimation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Niu, Lin(cdunl@hotmail.com) ",10.1109/ISCID.2015.159,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: ZD2014015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61463013, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.61463013) and Educational Commission of Yunnan Province of China (Grant No. ZD2014015).,9781467395861.0,,,"May 11, 2016",English,Quality control,"Proceedings - 2015 8th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design, ISCID 2015",13.0,559-562,1of2,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2015 8th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design, ISCID 2015",IEEE Nanjing Computational Intelligence Chapter; University of Bristol; Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Zhejiang University,Model Identification and Control Strategies for Batch Cooling Crystallizers,,Batch cooling crystallizers - Batch crystallization - Controller structures - Crystallization process - Dynamic optimization - Generic model control - Model identification - Optimal controls,1
"Proc.IEEE Int. Conf. Software Eng. Serv. Sci., ICSESS","With the completion of the human genome sequencing, a large number of data especially amino acid sequences floods into biological database. How to analyze these data quickly and even predict the structure and function of protein correctly have become hot topics in recent years. In this paper, we mainly study K-means clustering algorithm and KNN classifier in amino acid sequences of complicated data, which are applied in the prediction of protein sub-cellular localization. In many cases, fuzzy boundary and unbalance are frequently appeared among biological data. The accuracy will be lower, if we make a prediction through traditional KNN and K-means clustering algorithm directly. Firstly, in order to make clear the unbalance, we propose the within-class thought to make sure that training samples in each class around the testing sample are selected and we introduce membership to tell which class the testing sample belongs to. Then, we bring in rough sets and membership to solve the fuzzy boundary. Particularly, we apply correlation coefficient in the rough sets to better reflect the relationship among data objects. The experimental results based on protein sub-cellular localization prediction show that the methods proposed newly better work than the traditional methods. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171403541191,7883060,"Lei, Zhenfeng (1); Wang, Shunfang (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650504, China ",,"461.8.2 Bioinformatics - 723.1 Computer Programming - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",126924.0,"August 26, 2016 - August 28, 2016","Beijing, China","7th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science, ICSESS 2016",Amino acids - Bioinformatics - Classification (of information) - Codes (symbols) - Data mining - Forecasting - Learning algorithms - Proteins - Rough set theory - Software engineering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shunfang(wangsf_66@hotmaiLcom) ",10.1109/ICSESS.2016.7883060,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),23270594,"Number: 11261068, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",National Natural Science Foundation of China (11261068).,9781467399036.0,23270586,,"July 2, 2016",English,Clustering algorithms,ICSESS 2016 - Proceedings of 2016 IEEE 7th International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science,19.0,249-252,1 of 1,2016,IEEE Computer Society,"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences, ICSESS",IEEE Beijing Section; The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,Applied biological data mining based on improved K-means clustering algorithm and KNN classifier in protein sub-cellular localization,,Amino acid sequence - Biological data mining - Biological database - Classification algorithm - Correlation coefficient - Improved k-means clustering - K-Means clustering algorithm - Sub-cellular,0

Bioresour. Technol.,"The aim of this work is to explore integracide analogues from secondary metabolites of microorganisms. A new tetracyclic triterpene sulfate was produced by solid-state fermentation (SSF) with Fusarium sambucinum B10.2. The tetracyclic triterpene sulfate was identified as (3S,5R,10S,11S,12S,13R,17R,20R)-4,4-dimethylergosta-8,14,24-triene-3,11,12-triol-12-acetate, 3-sulfate on the basis of HRESIMS, NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra and named sambacide (1). The antibacterial and antifungal assays of sambacide (1) showed significant antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The fermentation conditions including culture media, fermentation temperature and time, were optimized. And potato was selected as the fermentation substrate, 28 °C was used as the fermentation temperature, and 20-days fermentation time was determined for F. sambucinum-SSF to produce sambacide (1) with a high yield of 19.04 ± 0.82 g/kg.

Struct Eng Mech,"Elasticity solutions for bi-directional functionally graded beams subjected to arbitrary lateral loads are conducted, with emphasis on the end effects. The material is considered macroscopically isotropic, with Young's modulus varying exponentially in both axial and thickness directions, while Poisson's ratio remaining constant. In order to obtain an exact analysis of stress and displacement fields, the symplectic analysis based on Hamiltonian state space approach is employed. The capability of the symplectic framework for exact analysis of bi-directional functionally graded beams has been validated by comparing numerical results with corresponding ones in open literature. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the influences of the material gradations on localized stress distributions. Thus, the material properties of the bi-directional functionally graded beam can be tailored for the potential practical purpose by choosing suitable graded indices. © 2016 Techno-Press, Ltd.",,20162802592309,,"Zhao, Li (1); Zhu, Jun (2); Wen, Xiao D.

Neurocomputing,"Recent advances in sensor manufacture and computer vision technologies have simulated the applications of intelligent transportation systems, while a key yet under-addressed issue in these systems is the semantic summarization of large scale surveillance video. The main difficulty of large scale surveillance video summarization arises from the contradiction between the high-degree spatiotemporal redundancies and the limited storage budget. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of large scale surveillance video summarization on the basis of event detection. In the proposed approach, we firstly obtain the trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians in a tracking-by-detection manner, and then detect the abnormal events using the trajectories. Finally, we design a disjoint max-coverage algorithm to generate a summarized sequence with maximum coverage of interested events and minimum number of frames. Compared with traditional key frame-based approaches, our approach enjoys the following favorable features. First, important information can be efficiently extracted from the redundant contents since the approach is event-centric and those interested events contain almost all the important information. Second, abnormal events are successfully detected by combining the Random Forest classifier and the trajectory features. Third, the abnormal events are designed to display, and hence further reduces the compression ratio. Due to the above features, the proposed approach is suitable for different scenarios, ranges from highway to crowded crossings. Experiments on 12 surveillance sequences validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Open Access,20155101708897,,"Song, Xinhui (1); Sun, Li (1); Lei, Jie (1); Tao, Dapeng (2); Yuan, Guanhong (1); Song, Mingli (1) ","(1) College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",NRCGEO,662.1 Automobiles - 716.4 Television Systems and Equipment - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Automobile manufacture - Budget control - Compression ratio (machinery) - Decision trees - Intelligent systems - Monitoring - Semantics - Trajectories - Video recording,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Mingli ",10.1016/j.neucom.2015.07.131,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18728286,"Number: 2013AA040601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013DFG12840, Acronym: -, Sponsor: International Cooperation and Exchange Programme; Number: 61572428, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the Program of International S&T Cooperation ( 2013DFG12840 ), by the National Science Foundation of China ( 61572428 ), by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities , by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China ( 2013AA040601 ).",,09252312,,"April 26, 2016",English,Security systems,,31.0,66-74,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Neurocomputing,,Event-based large scale surveillance video summarization,,Area-reconstruction - Computer vision technology - Effectiveness and efficiencies - Intelligent transportation systems - Random forest classifier - Surveillance video - Tracking by detections - Video summarization,187

Int. Commun. Heat Mass Transf.,"A novel method relying on image analysis and statistics is developed to estimate the mixing time accurately in a direct-contact heat exchanger. The critical point determination of pseudo homogeneous process impact on the accurate estimation of mixing time is investigated by proposed a three-sigma (3σ) method, which satisfies approximately normal distribution and exceeding the range of μ - 3σ occurring twice. Quantitative comparisons of the mixing time are conducted with mean value method, slope method and standard deviation method. Results show that correlation degree and correlation coefficient for the mixing time estimated by 3σ method give good agreement with the volumetric heat transfer coefficient average. Additionally, quasi steady state is quantified by time intervals between inhomogeneous time and mixing time. Experiments and simulations confirmed that neglecting critical point could result in significant errors in mixing time estimation. This method is capable of estimating the mixing time obtained by different mixing curves (e.g., slope p) that vary at the beginning of mixing and rapidly become stabilized after fluctuations, which can be an alternative tool for practical engineering applications with good accuracy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20161702300216,,"Xu, Jianxin (1, 2); Xiao, Qingtai (1, 2); Fei, Yu (3); Wang, Shibo (1); Huang, Junwei (4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Quality Development Institute, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) School of Statistics and Mathematics, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (4) Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China ",IHMTDL,616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Heat exchangers - Heat transfer coefficients - Normal distribution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fei, Yu(feiyukm@aliyun.com) ",10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2016.04.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FB020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Manchester; Number: 51406071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11561071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 42111217003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (project nos. 11561071 and 51406071 ), Yunnan Province and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics Education Cooperation Consulting Project ( 42111217003 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2013FB020 ).

IOP Conf. Ser. Earth Environ. Sci.,"This study considers the compensation of water diversion projects for the values of the terrestrial biological resources, water environment, and aquatic biological resources in water sources. An analysis of capital dynamics was conducted, and the economic development coefficient was used to correct the current method for calculating ecological compensation. A model was constructed to calculatethe ecological compensation for the water sources for water diversion projects. This model was used to calculate the ecological compensation for the Niulanjiang River provided by the Niulanjiang River to the Dianchi Lake water diversion project, which was calculated to be 136,799,400 RMB. As long as we know the occupying area of the project, the change of the river net flow after diversion and the local average GDP, the ecological compensation for water sources could be calculated by the model. The proposed model for calculating the ecological compensation for water sources is simple and incorporates the compensation provided by water diversion projects for the various environmental effects on water sources. It provides a guarantee for the capital to be used for the environmental protection of water sources and facilitates the sustainable development of the ecological environments of water sources. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Open Access,20164002872084,012004,"Su, H.B.

Chem. Eng. J.,"The thermosetting solid-solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) composed of poly(ethylene glycol)-based two components, isocyanate-terminated prepolymer and tetrahydroxy prepolymer, were synthesized via solvent-free bulk polymerization, endowing the thermosetting PCMs with flexible application capability. The chemical structures, crystalline properties, phase change properties, thermal energy storage mechanism, thermal reliability and stability of the synthesized PCMs were respectively characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, accelerated thermal cycling testing and thermogravimetric analysis. The intrinsic crystalline structure in SSPCMs is not influenced by the crosslinking reaction between two components. However, compared with the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), the lamellae and spherulite size in SSPCMs decrease to some entente and dramatically, respectively. The SSPCMs have proper phase change temperature of about 45 °C and high phase change enthalpy of about 100 J/g much less than the PEG, resulted from the small spherulite and lamellae size working together. The SSPCM-based thermal energy storage relies on the phase change from the crystalline state to the amorphous state and vice versa. The SSPCMs have good thermal reliability and stability with the degradation temperature higher than 300 °C. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20160701941089,,"Fu, Xiaowei (1); Xiao, Yao (1); Hu, Kai (1); Wang, Jiliang (2); Lei, Jingxin (1); Zhou, Changlin (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610065, China (2) School of Chemistry Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",CMEJAJ,694.4 Storage - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 944.6 Temperature Measurements,,,,,Chemical analysis - Chemical stability - Crosslinking - Crystalline materials - Differential scanning calorimetry - Ethylene glycol - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Heat storage - Monomers - Organic solvents - Polyethylene glycols - Polyols - Reliability analysis - Storage (materials) - Synthesis (chemical) - Thermal energy - Thermogravimetric analysis - Thermosets - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lei, Jingxin(jxlei@scu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.cej.2016.01.096,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,13858947,,"May 01, 2016",English,Phase change materials,,32.0,138-148,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Chemical Engineering Journal,,Thermosetting solid-solid phase change materials composed of poly(ethylene glycol)-based two components: Flexible application for thermal energy storage,,Accelerated thermal cycling - Crystalline properties - Degradation temperatures - Flexible applications - Phase change enthalpy - Phase change temperature - Polarizing optical microscopy - Solid-solid phase change materials,291

From the results, we can deduce that the main factors are social economic and cultural factors that affect the IS expansion. © 2015 IEEE.",,20161502221126,7378549,"Guilin, Wang (1, 2); Kun, Yang (2, 3); Yiwu, Xu (2, 3); Baoyun, Wang (2, 3) ","(1) School of Tourism and Geographic Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China (2) Engineering Research Center of GIS Technology in Western China, Ministry of Education, Kunming, China (3) School of Information Science and Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China ",,403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 951 Materials Science,119044.0,"June 19, 2015 - June 21, 2015","Wuhan, China","23rd International Conference on Geoinformatics, Geoinformatics 2015",Entropy - Housing - Land use - Population statistics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Kun, Yang(kmdcynu@163.com) ",10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2015.7378549,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),21610258,,,9781467376631.0,2161024X,,"January 11, 2016",English,Expansion,"Proceedings - 23rd International Conference on Geoinformatics 2015, Geoinformatics 2015",24.0,,1of1,2016,IEEE Computer Society,International Conference on Geoinformatics,"China Association for Geographic Information Service; Chinese Society for Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation; Natural Resources and Geospatial Information Committee, China Information Association; Wuhan Zondy Cyber Group Co., Ltd",Mining the drive mechanism for Impervious Surface expansion with index of entropy,,Cultural factors - Eco-environmental - Impervious surface - Interior mechanisms - Lake basins - Land use and land cover change - Population densities - Social-economic,2016-January
J. Spectroscopy,"Nowadays, wild-grown edible mushrooms which are natural, nutritious, and healthy get more and more popular by large consumers. In this paper, UV spectra of different Boletaceae mushrooms with the aid of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were shown to be a practical and rapid method for discrimination purpose. The specimens of Boletus edulis, Boletus ferrugineus, Boletus tomentipes, Leccinum rugosiceps, and Xerocomus sp. were described based on the UV spectra. From the results, all the specimens were characterized by strong absorption at the wavelengths of 274 and 284 nm and showed the shoulder at 296 nm. However, changes could be seen in the peak heights at the same wavelength for different samples. After analyzing by chemometrics, visual discrimination among samples was presented and the relationships among them were also obtained. This study showed that UV spectroscopy combined with chemometrics methods could be used successfully as a simple and effective approach for characterization of these five wild-grown edible mushrooms at species and genus levels. Meanwhile, this rapid and simple methodology could also provide reference for the discrimination of edible mushrooms. © 2016 Yan Li et al.",Open Access,20164903095723,7813405,"Li, Yan (1, 2, 3); Zhang, Ji (1, 2); Li, Tao (4); Yang, Tianwei (5); Wang, Yuanzhong (1, 2); Liu, Honggao (5) ","(1) Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming; 650200, China (2) Yunnan Technical Center for Quality of Chinese Materia Medica, Kunming; 650200, China (3) College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming; 650500, China (4) College of Resources and Environment, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi; 653100, China (5) College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922 Statistical Methods - 961 Systems Science",,,,,Cluster analysis - Discriminant analysis - Hierarchical systems - Least squares approximations - Ultraviolet spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yuanzhong(boletus@126.com) ",10.1155/2016/7813405,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),23144939,"Number: 2016ZZX106, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31660591, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21667031, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31660591, 21667031) and the Science Foundation of the Yunnan Province Department of Education (2016ZZX106).",,23144920,,2016,English,Fungi,,40.0,,,2016,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Journal of Spectroscopy,,"Ultraviolet Spectroscopy Used to Fingerprint Five Wild-Grown Edible Mushrooms (Boletaceae) Collected from Yunnan, China",,"Edible mushroom - Effective approaches - Hierarchical cluster analysis - Large consumers - Partial least squares discriminant analyses (PLSDA) - Strong absorptions - Visual discrimination - Yunnan , China",2016

Mater. Des.,"By using surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) at room temperature, a gradient structure (GS) is generated in the surface layer of bulk pure copper samples, which exhibits good uniform elongation and high yield strength simultaneously. Changing SMAT processing time leads to different gradient structures with various component fractions and therefore tune their mechanical properties. The yield strength of the SMAT samples is much higher than the sum of standalone GS layer and coarse-grained (CG) matrix, indicating a synergetic strengthening. Repeated stress relaxation tests were performed to characterize the evolution of mobile dislocations. It was found that the relative mobile dislocation density of SMAT processed sample first drops and then increases with increasing tensile strain. The evolution of mobile dislocations correlates well with strain-hardening evolution. These observations provide insight for the superior combination of high strength and good ductility in SMAT samples. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20162202431067,,"Yin, Zhe (1); Yang, Xincheng (1); Ma, Xiaolong (2); Moering, Jordan (2); Yang, Jian (1); Gong, Yulan (1); Zhu, Yuntian (2, 3); Zhu, Xinkun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh; NC; 27695, United States (3) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing; 210094, China ",,537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 544.1 Copper - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Copper - Density (specific gravity) - Ductility - Mechanical properties - Strain hardening - Stress relaxation - Testing - Yield stress,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Xinkun(xk_zhu@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.matdes.2016.05.015,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734197,"Number: -, Acronym: NUST, Sponsor: Nanjing University of Science and Technology; Number: W911NF-09-1-0427, Acronym: ARO, Sponsor: Army Research Office; Number: W911QX-08-C-0083, Acronym: ARO, Sponsor: Army Research Office; Number: KKSY201407100, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51561015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge financial supports by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (grant, 51561015 ), and the introduction of talents fund project of Kunming University of Science and Technology (grant KKSY201407100 ).

RSC Adv.,"Chalcones play an important role in living organisms with a wide range of biological activities including potent antitumor activity. Previously, we reported that N-aryl piperazine compounds have excellent biological activity. To further explore the structure-activity relationships, a series of novel hybrid compounds between chalcone and piperazine have been synthesized, and their in vitro antitumor activity was evaluated against a panel of human tumor cell lines. The results demonstrated that compounds bearing acetophenone showed better anticancer activity than cisplatin and other hybrid compounds, and that substitution of the acetophenone with halogen atom, was vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. Among all synthetic derivatives, hybrid compound 7c was found to be the most potent compound against A549, Hela and SGC7901 (IC50= 5.24 μM, 0.19 μM and 0.41 μM, respectively), importantly, 7c exerted obvious inhibitory effect in vivo. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20160501877265,,"Mao, Zewei (1); Zheng, Xi (2); Qi, Yan (2); Zhang, Mengdi (1); Huang, Yao (1); Wan, Chunping (2); Rao, Gaoxiong (1) ","(1) School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Central Laboratory, No. 1 Affiliated Hospital of Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming; 650021, China ",RSCACL,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Bioactivity - Cell culture - Cytotoxicity - Ketones,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wan, Chunping(wanchunping1012@163.com) ",10.1039/c5ra20197g,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,10,2016,English,Halogen compounds,,21.0,7723-7727,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel hybrid compounds between chalcone and piperazine as potential antitumor agents,,Anti-tumor activities - Anti-tumor agents - Anticancer activities - Biological evaluation - Cytotoxic activities - Human tumor cell lines - Inhibitory effect - Structure activity relationships,6
Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"As a kind of main material for biogas plants, industrial biogas crop plays an important role in energy and ecology area, in which ecological factors should be considered during the screening and planting of industrial biogas crop. Among those ecological factors, net ecosystem production(NEP) and water use efficiency(WUE) are the most important ones. NEP can indicate the status of carbon sinks or sources, and WUE can reflect the coupling of carbon and water cycles at ecosystem level. Screening those crops with high NEP and WUE will be beneficial to the decreasing of greenhouse gas emissions and the increasing of water using effect, which also can promote the development of biogas industry. To provide theoretical basis for the screening and scale planting of industrial biogas crop, the NEP and WUE of 4 crops in central Yunnan, including 2 types of maize (Zea mays L.) Quchen 9 and Yunrui 88, hybrid pennisetum (Penniseturm americanum × P. purpureum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa), were analyzed under normal planting conditions. The measurements were taken on the pilot farm(25°18′N and 102°45′E, with an elevation of 1978 m) of Yunnan Agriculture University, Kunming, China. The climate was classified as subtropical plateau monsoon climate, with a mean annual temperature of 15.3 and a mean annual precipitation of 979.3 mm. The soil was upland red soil. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with 3 replicates, and there were a total of 15 experimental plots with an area of 30 m2for each plot. All plots were surrounded and separated by concrete ridges. The ridges were 100 cm underground and 20 cm aboveground. The 2 breeds of maize were transplanted on May 20th and harvested on September 29th, 2013. Hybrid pennisetum and alfalfa were planted on March 20th, 2012 by cuttage propagation and seed reproduction separately, and both were reaped 3 times on May 20th, July 12th and September 29th, 2013, respectively. The NEP and WUE were investigated during the growing period of maize, from May 20th to September 29th, 2013. For hybrid pennisetum and alfalfa, the total amount of the last 2 harvests was the aboveground biomass. Soil core method (Luoyang shovel) was used to obtain the root samples of hybrid pennisetum and alfalfa in 0-90 cm soil layer. The underground biomass of 2 crops was determined on May 20th and September 29th, 2013 respectively, and the difference for the 2 times was the increasing amount of the underground biomass. The roots were obtained when the corn was harvested, and the underground biomass was determined by drying the roots. Soil water content was observed with a PR2 soil moisture meter. Soil respiration was measured by the soda lime absorption method and corrected by the static closed chamber. The water evaporation was detected by the no-weighting-lysimeter. The meteorological indices, including temperature and rainfall, were recorded with a weather station. The NEP was calculated by subtracting the quantity of soil respiration from net primary productivity. The evapotranspiration, the population water use efficiency(WUEp), and the ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe) were estimated by water balance equation. The results showed that: 1) The NEP decreased in this order: hybrid pennisetum (17 533.1 kg/hm2) > maize Quchen 9(9 172.9 kg/hm2) > maize Yunrui 88(8 462.7 kg/hm2)>alfalfa(273.6 kg/hm2)>bare land(-2 377.0 kg/hm2). The data showed that the 4 industrial biogas crops acted as a CO2sink. No significant difference in NEP could be observed between the 2 breeds of maize, while significant difference at the 0.01 level was showed between any 2 crops of maize, hybrid pennisetum and alfalfa. 2) The WUEp of the crops decreased as follows: hybrid pennisetum (10.89 kg/m3)>maize Quchen 9 (7.23 kg/m3)>maize Yunrui 88 (6.79 kg/m3)>alfalfa(3.46 kg/m3). And the WUEedecreased in the same order: hybrid pennisetum(4.19 kg/m3)>maize Quchen 9(2.38 kg/m3)>maize Yunrui 88(2.20 kg/m3)>alfalfa(0.06 kg/m3). No significant difference could be observed in WUEpand WUEebetween the 2 breeds of maize, while significant difference at the 0.01 level was showed between any 2 crops of maize, hybrid pennisetum and alfalfa. Comprehensively considering biomass, NEP, WUEpand WUEe, the bybrid pennisetum demonstrates obvious advantage over other 3 crops under normal planting conditions and is more preferential to be popularized and cultivated. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Sens. Lett.,"Recently, the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being widely used in various fields which can simultaneously support many kinds of sensing tasks in a common sensor field. In heterogeneous sensor networks (HSNs), the network topology may change due to environmental factors or energy depletion, the position of the moving object and the observer, adding a new node; each node generates data packets with a different size, degrading the network performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel three-dimensional probability CSMA/CA scheme based on the adaption and RTS/CTS mechanism, which is a variation on the basis of IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA, solving the three problems. The mathematical model based on the discrete time is presented and analyzed to measure the performance. Network aggregate throughput and multiple priorities throughput with diverse business are successfully detected. Simulation results are given to verify the accuracy of the improved model.

Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao,"We had collected the soils of high-cover basalt slope grown with Pinus yunnanensis and Cynodon dactylon, and investigated the properties of macropores which have a significant effect on the formation and occurrence of landslide based on the water breakthrough method and variance, regression analysis. It was demonstrated that the vegetation type can not control the general evolution law of the water movement in macropores, but it does influence the amplitude and stability time of the water breakthrough curve. The two soils showed the characteristic that large diameter(>2.4 mm) macropores accounts less amount, and the small macropores accounts more. Different vegetation soils have the different macropore quantity in different depth, but it has no influence on the spatial distribution of large macropore quantity. The diameter of macropores in the two soils mainly concentrate in 2.6-0.6 mm, while the range of average diameter is 1.86-1.0mm. Macropore size range is much more controlled by the type of vegetation than its size distribution. The water flow rate in different vegetation soils are influenced in different level by the macropore character. On the whole, with the depth increases, the two soils' macropore quantity, average-maximum-minimum diameter, macroporosity and the stable infiltration coefficient will decrease. Roots and organic matter have different influence on macropore's properties in different vegetation soils. For soils grown with Pinus yunnanensis and Cynodon dactylon, particle distribution has no obvious contribution to the the macropore's properties in different depths. The results have shown that the macropore's lower limit scale value is 600 μm. © 2016, Science Press.

Neurocomputing,"This paper proposes a modified dynamic surface control (DSC) for speed tracking and torsional vibration suppression for two-inertia systems with nonlinear friction. The proposed controller contains two parts: tracking controller and friction compensator. The tracking controller is designed by modifying dynamic surface control, which replaces the traditional first-order filter with a high-gain tracking differentiator (HGTD). Meanwhile, an improved prescribed performance function with error constraint is also presented and incorporated into DSC design. As for the friction compensator, the nonlinear nonsmooth friction is parameterized and then compensated using echo state neural networks (ESNs). The state observer with friction compensation is used to estimate unmeasurable load speed and torsional torque. The effectiveness of proposed control scheme is verified by simulation and experiment results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..",,20162002402813,,"Wang, Shubo (1); Ren, Xuemei (1); Na, Jing (2); Gao, Xuehui (1) ","(1) School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing; 100081, China (2) Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",NRCGEO,732.1 Control Equipment - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 931.1 Mechanics,,,,,Stiction - Tribology - Vibrations (mechanical),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ren, Xuemei(xmren@bit.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.neucom.2016.03.040,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18728286,"Number: 20121101110029, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61273150, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61573174, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61433003, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61321002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61433003 , 61273150 , 61573174 , 61321002 ), the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China ( 20121101110029 ).",,09252312,,"August 26, 2016",English,Controllers,,39.0,73-85,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Neurocomputing,,Robust tracking and vibration suppression for nonlinear two-inertia system via modified dynamic surface control with error constraint,,Dynamic surface control - Friction compensation - Prescribed performance - Two-inertia system - Vibration suppression,203
Ecol. Model.,"Sensitivity analysis is a primary approach used in mathematical modeling to identify important factors that control the response dynamics in a model. In this paper, we applied the Morris sensitivity analysis method to identify the important factors governing the dynamics in a complex 3-dimensional water quality model. The water quality model was developed using the Environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) to simulate the fate and transport of nutrients and algal dynamics in Lake Dianchi, one of the most polluted large lakes in China. The analysis focused on the response of four water quality constituents, including chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, to 47 parameters and 7 external driving forces. We used Morris sensitivity analysis with different sample sizes and factor perturbation ranges to study the sensitivity with regard to different output metrics of the water quality model, and we analyzed the consistency between different sensitivity scenarios. In addition to the analysis with aggregate outputs, a spatiotemporal variability analysis was performed to understand the spatial heterogeneity and temporal distribution of sensitivities. Our results indicated that it is important to consider multiple characteristics in a sensitivity analysis, and we have identified a robust set of sensitive factors in the water quality model that will be useful for systematic model parameter identification and uncertainty analysis. © 2016 .",,20160801991904,,"Yi, Xuan (1, 2); Zou, Rui (3, 4); Guo, Huaicheng (1) ","(1) College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, The Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences Ministry of Education, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca; NY; 14850, United States (3) Tetra Tech, Inc, 10306 Eaton Place, Ste 340, Fairfax; VA; 22030, United States (4) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China ",ECMODT,445.2 Water Analysis - 453.2 Water Pollution Control - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Biochemical oxygen demand - Dissolved oxygen - Dynamics - Factor analysis - Lakes - Nutrients - Quality control - Uncertainty analysis - Water pollution control - Water quality,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zou, Rui(rz5q2008@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.01.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 201406010221, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: UC, Sponsor: University of California; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Cornell University; Number: 2013ZX07102, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The authors wish to express their gratitude to the China Scholarship Council ( 201406010221 ) for funding the visiting venture that generated this paper.

J. Discrete Math. Sci. Cryptography,"In the information retrieval field, ontology plays a crucial role in searching for information that is highly semantic similar to the query concept in origin. It also plays a major roles in returning the results to the user. The main purpose of ontology algorithm lies in obtaining the function for calculating the similarity between concepts. One learning technology in applying ontology is to obtain a ontology function f:V Æ R In this structure, it maps each vertex to a real number and the similarity between two concepts is then determined by the difference of their real numbers. In this article, we report a sparse vector learning algorithm for ontology similarity measure and ontology mapping in terms of gradient descent and iterative computation. The ontology penalty term in optimization model is reformulated by virtue of dual norm, and then the smooth approximation to this penalty term is obtained. The main procedure of our algorithm is iterative computation based on gradient descent tricks. Results achieved in the simulation experiments show that the new proposed algorithm is highly efficient and accuracy in ontology similarity measure and ontology mapping in multiple disciplines. © 2016 Taru Publications.",,20162902617286,,"Yan, Li (1); Li, Ying-Jiang (1); Yang, Xiang (1); Gao, Wei (2) ","(1) School of Engineering Honghe University, Mengzi; 661100, China (2) School of Information and Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,405.3 Surveying - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Iterative methods - Mapping - Ontology - Semantics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gao, Wei(gaowei@ynnu.edu.cn) ",10.1080/09720529.2016.1178934,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,09720529,3,"May 3, 2016",English,Learning algorithms,,39.0,753-775,,2016,"Taru Publications, G-159, Pushkar Enclave, Pashchim Vihar , New Delhi, 110 063, India",Journal of Discrete Mathematical Sciences and Cryptography,,Gradient descent technology for sparse vector learning in ontology algorithms,,Gradient descent - Iterative computation - Ontology mapping - Optimization modeling - Searching for informations - Similarity measure - Smooth approximation - Sparse vectors,19

Laser Micro Nanoeng.,"In this work, laser spatial patterns with sub-diffraction-limit structures are acquired systematically by wave-front modulation of different polarized Gaussian beams based on the vectorial diffraction theory. The Gaussian beams, which are in circular, radial and azimuthal polarization, are applied with special designed phase plates.

The mechanism of forming sub-diffraction-limit patterns has been illustrated detailedly, as well as the topography of the vast novel beam patterns with special dimensional distribution near the focal plane.

Sci. Eng. Compos. Mater.,"We prepared intercalated organic montmorillonite (OMMT) from a pristine MMT and long-alkyl-chain quaternary ammonium salts (LACQAS). X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses revealed that the amount, carbon atoms, and alkyl chains of LACQAS influenced the large value of d(001)of OMMT significantly. The d(001)stabilized at 100-150 mmol·(100 g)-1of LACQAS/MMT. The single LACQAS cations arranged in the form of a lateral layer or half-paraffin-type molecular structure between MMT layers, whereas the dual and triple LACQAS cations arranged in the form of a paraffin-type molecular structure. The pyrolysis temperature and maximum pyrolysis rate of OMMT increased greatly compared with those of MMT. The thermal weight loss of MMT was caused by the removed absorbed and structural water, whereas that of OMMT was by the pyrolysis of LACQAS.

In the actual spread process, the activated probability of node increases with its newly increasing activated neighbors, which also decreases with time. In this paper, we focus on the problem that selects k seeds based on the cascade model with diffusion decay to maximize the spread of influence in social networks. First, we extend the independent cascade model to incorporate the diffusion decay factor, called as the cascade model with diffusion decay and abbreviated as CMDD. Then, we discuss the objective function of maximizing the spread of influence under the CMDD, which is NP-hard. We further prove the monotonicity and submodularity of this objective function. Finally, we use the greedy algorithm to approximate the optimal result with the ration of 1 − 1/e. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.",,20163302708233,,"Zhang, Zhijian (1, 2); Wu, Hong (1, 3); Yue, Kun (1); Li, Jin (4); Liu, Weiyi (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) College of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (3) College of Computer Science and Engineering, Qujing Normal University, Qujing, China (4) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,"407.2 Waterways - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 801.2 Biochemistry - 971 Social Sciences",179369.0,"August 20, 2016 - August 22, 2016","Harbin, China","2nd International Conference on Young Computer Scientists, Engineers and Educators, ICYCSEE 2016",Decay (organic) - Diffusion - Social networking (online) - Stream flow,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yue, Kun(kyue@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-981-10-2053-7_37,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 201501CF00022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: XT412011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: XT412003, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61562091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61562091), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2014FA023, 201501CF00022), Program for Innovative Research Team in Yunnan University (XT412011), and Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University (XT412003).",9789811020520.0,18650929,,2016,English,Economic and social effects,"Social Computing - 2nd International Conference of Young Computer Scientists, Engineers and Educators, ICYCSEE 2016, Proceedings",25.0,418-427,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,Influence maximization for cascade model with diffusion decay in social networks,,CASCADE model - Diffusion model - Greedy algorithms - Influence maximizations - Monotonicity - Objective functions - Optimal results - Submodularity,623

A directly modulated laser (DML) and an electro-absorption modulator integrated laser (EML) in C-band are both used for optical subcarrier modulation. The IMD3s induced by the two optical subcarrier modulations are suppressed by each other through adjusting the bias voltage of the electro-absorption modulator in the EML.

J Franklin Inst,"This paper proposes an adaptive control strategy by employing dynamic surface control (DSC) technique and fuzzy disturbance observer (FDO) for the two-inertia system with uncertainties and external disturbance. Firstly, the unknown elements including uncertainties and external disturbance are estimated by using a fuzzy disturbance observer which does not need a priori information of these unknown dynamics. Next, the estimations of unknown disturbance are integrated into DSC design by using recursive feedbacks to damp torsional vibration. The 'explosion of complexity' in conventional backstepping technique is avoided by introducing first-order filters. The stability analysis of the design scheme is verified based on the Lyapunov stability theory. All the signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error can be made arbitrarily small by adjusting the design parameters. Comparative simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J. Cloud Comput.,"Although several cloud storage systems have been proposed, most of them can provide highly efficient point queries only because of the key-value pairs storing mechanism. For these systems, satisfying complex multi-dimensional queries means scanning the whole dataset, which is inefficient. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional index framework, based on the Skip-list and Octree, which we refer to as Skip-Octree. Using a randomized skip list makes the hierarchical Octree structure easier to implement in a cloud storage system. To support the Skip-Octree, we also propose a series of index operation algorithms including range query algorithm, index maintenance algorithms, and dynamic index scaling algorithms. Through experimental evaluation, we show that the Skip-Octree index is feasible and efficient. © 2016 The Author(s).",Open Access,20165203193259,,"He, Jing (1, 3); Wu, Yue (1); Dong, Yunyun (2); Zhang, Yunchun (3); Zhou, Wei (3) ","(1) School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu; Sichuan; 611731, China (2) Research Center of Western Yunnan Development, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China (3) National Pilot School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",,"722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis",,,,,Indexing (of information),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Wei(zwei@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1186/s13677-016-0060-1,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),2192113X,"Number: 2012FD0047, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Basic Research Programs of Sichuan Province; Number: 61540061, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; Number: 61363021, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014Y013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","This work is supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (61363021, 61540061), Science Research Foundation of Yunnan Province Education Department (2014Y013) and the Youth Program of Applied Basic Research Programs in Yunnan Province (2012FD0047).

Hupo Kexue/J. Lake Sc.,"Four vertical flow constructed wetlands were employed to evaluate the purification effects within tail water in different seasons under four hydraulic loading rates (125, 250, 375 and 500 mm/d). The results showed that the highest removal efficiency of total nitrogen was achieved in autumn while decreased significantly in winter. The key points of temperature and dissolved oxygen for denitrification were 10 and 1.1 mg/L, respectively. The wetland system was more effective for phosphorus removal in winter than in other seasons. Removal efficiency of CODCrunder 125 mm/d was significantly higher than that of other hydraulic loading rates, the lowest treatment performance of CODCrwas achieved in winter,and with no significant variation in other hydraulic loading rates and other seasons. To obtain a full pollutant-removal efficiency of the wetland system, the optimal hydraulic loading rate is at 125 mm/d. To reach the V class of surface water environment quality standard, the optimal hydraulic loading rate is at 375 mm/d. To receive the amount of pollutant removal, the optimal hydraulic loading rate is 500 mm/d. Based on full consideration, the optimal hydraulic loading rate should be at 375 mm/d. © 2016 by Journal of Lake Sciences.",Open Access,20160902037400,,"Liang, Kang (1, 3); Chang, Junjun (2); Wang, Feihua (1); Liu, Shuangyuan (1, 3); Liang, Wei (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan; 430072, China (2) Research Institute of Engineering and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China ",,444.1 Surface Water - 445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 452.1 Sewage - 691.2 Materials Handling Methods - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Biochemical oxygen demand - Dissolved oxygen - Efficiency - Nitrogen removal - Pollution - Purification - Storm sewers - Surface waters - Turbines - Water treatment - Wetlands,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liang, Wei(wliang@ihb.ac.cn) ",10.18307/2016.0113,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10035427,1,"January 6, 2016",Chinese,Loading,,21.0,114-123,,2016,Science Press,Hupo Kexue/Journal of Lake Sciences,,Purification ability of tail water and optimal hydraulic loading rates in vertical flow constructed wetland,,Hydraulic loading rates - Pollutant removal efficiency - Purification ability - Purification effect - Removal efficiencies - Seasonal variation - Treatment performance - Vertical flow constructed wetlands,28

We applied the method to the classification of growing areas of tobacco and also compared it with other methods. The results showed that our proposed method efficiently got the optimal feature subset and can be used to identify the growing areas of tobacco. The feature grouping divided all features into different groups according to feature importance scores measured by random forest variable importance measures. The optimal feature subset was generated by continuous groups with important features, while the groups with irrelevant features were eliminated, which degraded the difficulty of feature selection. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method successfully eliminated the irrelevant features and got the optimal feature subset, leading to a significant improvement on the classification accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.",,20165003106888,7726155,"Zhu, Cheng (1); Gong, Huili (1); Li, Zhongren (2); Yu, Chunxia (2) ","(1) College Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China (2) Technology Center, China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial Co., Ltd, Kunming, China ",,821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 961 Systems Science,124721.0,"July 8, 2016 - July 10, 2016","Beijing, China","3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2016",Cultivation - Decision trees - Infrared devices - Near infrared spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICISCE.2016.58,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509025350.0,,,"October 31, 2016",English,Tobacco,"Proceedings - 2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2016",21.0,230-234,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2016",Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture; China Jiliang University; et al.; The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Hull; Xiamen University,Application of High Dimensional Feature Grouping Method in Near-Infrared Spectra of Identification of Tobacco Growing Areas,,Classification accuracy - Feature grouping - High dimensional feature - Important features - Irrelevant features - Near infrared spectra - Tobacco growing areas - Variable importances,
IEEE Trans Power Delivery,"Energy policies worldwide are mandating large-scale integration of solar panel (SP) generators with inverters on distribution systems. This causes several SPs to be connected to a distribution transformer. The SP and its interfacing inverter alter the performance characteristics of the transformer. In addition, when new sources and loads are connected to a distribution system, from an asset-management perspective, it is imperative to understand and quantify their effect on distribution system components. This paper presents a two-step study on the effects of SP on distribution transformers via simulation and experiments. In step one, the simulation work quantifies the amount of harmonic distortion caused by SP and associated inverters in distribution transformers considering solar farms and rooftop residential installations. The simulation work uses network topology, load, and generation data of a Canadian utility. Various inverter technologies, output powers, carrier signal frequencies, filtering techniques, numbers of active inverters, and transformer configurations are studied. In step two, level of harmonic distortion observed in simulation is created in a laboratory environment using a commercial inverter for SP applications. A three-phase dry-type transformer is tested to observe the effect of higher harmonic distortion on core and winding temperatures of the transformer. Experimental results conclude that under the worst case loading scenario (i.e., full load with active power flow reversed), the transformer lifetime expectancy is anticipated to decrease by 8.3%. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,20162402480583,7127048,"Awadallah, Mohamed A.

However, during slurry pipeline hydraulics design, there are some problems in slurry pipeline critical deposition formulas, such as the various forms of it, the big error of the calculated value and the narrow scope of application in it. Least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is a machine learning method based on statistical learning theory, which can avoid many shortcomings of the traditional neural network. Therefore, this paper introduced the least square support vector machine to predict the critical deposition velocity based on the analysis of the main factors that influence it.

IEEE Trans Dielectr Electr Insul,"According to IEEE Guide for Reducing Bird-Related Outages, several types of transmission line faults could be induced by birds. The number of birds increases as human awareness of environmental protection increases. Thus, the probability of suspension insulator string flashover induced by bird streamer would also increase. Analysis of transmission line faults in Yunnan, China, shows that many transmission line faults occurred in the winter bird migration zone, and most of the towers affected are 110 kV transmission line towers. Hence, investigating the flashover process of the 110 kV transmission line suspension insulator strings induced by bird streamer and designing a well bird-preventing installation for 110 kV transmission line suspension insulator strings is necessary. In this study, a simplified, self-designed 110 kV transmission line tower is utilized to experiment on the three types of 110 kV transmission line suspension insulator string with bird simulation excrement. The analysis of withstand test results has revealed the mechanism of flashover caused by bird streamer of the three types of suspension insulator string, and the protection radius R of the three types of insulator string has been presented. The mechanism of flashover and test results have been testified by means of the distributions of electric field and potential calculated by FEM method. Thus, the bird streamer caused flashover could be classified as the shortest air gap breakdown. Hence, it is valuable for designing or selecting a well bird-preventing installation. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170403286858,7823404,"Yang, Qing (1); Ran, Jiaquan (1); Han, Rui (1); Sun, Shangpeng (1); Chen, Yong (1); Zhou, Fangrong (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400030, China (2) Electric Power Research Institute, Yunnan Power Grid Company, Kunming; 650217, China ",ITDIES,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment,,,,,Electric insulators - Electric lines - Flashover,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TDEI.2016.006147,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10709878,6,December 2016,English,Birds,,16.0,3514-3522,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,,Protection radius of bird-preventing installation design for 110 kV suspension insulators based on withstand tests,,"Flashover process - Insulator string - protection radius - Suspension insulator strings - Suspension insulators - Transmission line faults - Transmission line towers - Yunnan , China",23

Appl. Catal. B Environ.,"Carbonaceous acids were synthesized from dealkaline lignin via solvothermal carbonization, pyrolysis and sulfonation. Carbonization of lignin in sub- and super-critical ethanol provided good surface properties with abundant functional groups (2.81 and 1.35 mmol [H+]/g) for the subsequent sulfonation to result in high active and stable catalysts for biodiesel production. Both catalysts (E-P400-2-SO3H and E-260-20-SO3H carbonized in sub- and super-critical ethanol) had high acid content of 5.35 and 5.05 (mmol [H+]/g), respectively. Highest biodiesel yields of 95.4% and 95.5% were obtained from the esterification of oleic acid at 80 °C with E-260-20-SO3H and E-P400-2-SO3H, respectively, with 5 cycles for E-260-20-SO3H (≥81.9% yield) and 3 cycles for E-P400-2-SO3H (≥84.6% yield). Both catalysts also applied to produce biodiesel from actual plant oils at 220 °C.

Electrochim Acta,"Hydrazine electro-oxidation takes an important role in direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHFCs) and hydrazine electrochemical sensor, but the high cost of precious metal electrode hinders the practical applications of hydrazine electro-oxidation. In this study, an inexpensive 3D electrode of Ni3S2@Ni foam was obtained through a hydrothermal condition using sodium sulfide as corrodent and Ni foam as both substrate and Ni source. The formation mechanism of this Ni3S2layer was studied through a process analysis based on physical chemistry with assistant of the results from characterizations. The obtained Ni3S2@Ni foam was used as electrode to test its hydrazine electro-oxidation properties in terms of DHFCs and electrochemical sensor. It is found Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses the ability to electro-oxidize hydrazine and Ni3S2layer leads to increased activity including lower onset potential and higher current. In the aspect of hydrazine electrochemical sensor, the fabricated Ni3S2layer leads to increased sensitivity and dynamic response property. The results indicate that as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam possesses a potential for practical application in hydrazine electro-oxidation, and Ni3S2is a very promising substitute material for noble metals in hydrazine electro-oxidation. At the same time, with the characterization of the as-prepared Ni3S2@Ni foam electrode on structure, morphology and surface chemical states, the mechanism of the corrosion method as well as enhanced properties were investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20163402730368,,"Liu, Xu (1); Li, Yuxiu (1); Chen, Nan (2); Deng, Dongyang (1); Xing, Xinxin (1); Wang, Yude (2, 3) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",ELCAAV,547.1 Precious Metals - 548.1 Nickel - 702.2 Fuel Cells - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Chemical analysis - Corrosion - Electrochemical sensors - Electrooxidation - Fuel cells - Hydrazine - Nickel - Nickel compounds - Oxidation - Physical chemistry - Precious metals - Sensors - Sodium sulfide - Sulfur compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.08.009,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: XT412003, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51262029) and Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University (XT412003).

RSC Adv.,"A turn-on fluorescent sensing platform for labetalol determination has been developed based on competitive host-guest interaction between p-sulfonated calix[6]arene (SCX6) and signal probe/target molecules by using SCX6 functionalized MnO2@reduced graphene oxide (SCX6-MnO2@RGO) as a receptor. Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and labetalol were selected as the probe and target molecules, respectively. When R6G enters into the SCX6 host, its fluorescence is quenched by MnO2@RGO. However, on addition of labetalol to the preformed R6G·SCX6-MnO2@RGO complex, the R6G molecule is displaced by labetalol from the host of SCX6, leading to a 'switch-on' fluorescence response. This is due to the fact that the binding constant of the labetalol/SCX6 complex is much higher than that of R6G/SCX6. The fluorescence intensity of the SCX6-MnO2@RGO·R6G complex increased linearly with increasing concentration of labetalol ranging from 1.0 to 18.0 μM. The proposed method showed a detection limit of 0.25 μM for labetalol. In addition, 2D NMR and molecular modeling studies indicated that the salicylamide part of the labetalol molecule inserted into the cavity of SCX6, while the phenylpropyl group located outside of the SCX6 host. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20163602774052,,"Ye, Hanzhang (1); Yang, Long (1); Zhao, Genfu (1); Zhang, Yanqiong (1); Ran, Xin (1); Wu, Shilian (1); Zou, Suo (1); Xie, Xiaoguang (1); Zhao, Hui (2); Li, Can-Peng (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resource, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Forster resonance energy transfer - Graphene - Molecules - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Probes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xie, Xiaoguang(xgxie@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6ra14835b,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 21565029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21565029) and the Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University.",,,83,2016,English,Manganese oxide,,47.0,79350-79360,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,A FRET-based fluorescent approach for labetalol sensing using calix[6]arene functionalized MnO2@graphene as a receptor,,Binding constant - Detection limits - Fluorescence intensities - Fluorescent sensing - Host guest interactions - Molecular modeling studies - Reduced graphene oxides - Target molecule,6

The result of experiments show that ammonium uranyl carbonate had weak capability to absorb microwave energy, while triuranium octaoxide has the very strong capability to absorb microwave energy and the sample temperature increased rapidly with an increase mixture ratio of triuranium octaoxide. The optimal calcination conditions were as follows: microwave power 700 W, calcination time 10 min and 60 g in this experiments range, respectively. Under these conditions the value of total uranium and U4• of triuranium octaoxide was 84.28% and 31.02%, respectively.

Appl. Soft Comput. J.,"In this paper, we introduce a new global optimization method and study its global convergence property through theoretical and experimental approaches. The proposed method is named as multivariant optimization algorithm (MOA) because the intelligent searchers, which are called as atoms, not only are divided into multiple subgroups but also are variant in responsibility. That is, global atoms explore the whole solution space in the hope of finding potential areas where local atoms start the local exploitation. The proposed method is characterized by two important features. On one hand, global atoms do the global exploration in each loop to jump out from local traps. On the other hand, global and local atoms conduct the global exploration and the local exploitation according to their own responsibility, respectively. These features contribute to increasing the chance of converging to the global best. To study the convergence property of MOA, we carried out the convergence analysis, numerical optimization experiments and the shortest path planning experiments. And the results demonstrate that MOA is globally convergent and superior to the compared methods in the global convergence accuracy and probability in solving complex challenging problems which have one or more features such as deceptiveness, randomly located optimum, asymmetry or multiple traps. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20163102656998,,"Li, Baolei (1, 2); Chen, Jianhua (2); Shi, Xinling (2); Zhang, Yufeng (2); Lv, Danjv (2); Liu, Lanjuan (2); Zhang, Qinhu (2) ","(1) Oil Equipment Intelligent Control Engineering Laboratory of Henan Province, Physics and Electronic Engineering College, Nanyang Normal University, Nanyang; 473061, China (2) Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",,921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922 Statistical Methods - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Atoms - Birds - Global optimization - Motion planning,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shi, Xinling(xlshi@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.asoc.2016.07.001,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 61261007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11303094, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29693-firefly-algorithm, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013FA008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61261007 and 11303094 ) and the Key Program of Yunnan Natural Science Foundation the Grant ( 2013FA008 ).

Chin. Phys.,"Single crystalline samples of type-I and type-VIII Ba8Ga16-xCuxSn30(x = 0, 1) clathrates are prepared by the Sn-flux method. Effects of Cu-doping on stability and electrical properties of Ba8Ga16Sn30single crystal are explored by first-principle and experiment. All samples are heated to different high temperatures and maintained at these temperatures for 120 min and then cooled to room temperature to explore their structural stabilities. Results from DTA and powder x-ray diffraction analysis indicate that type-I Ba8Ga16Sn30structure is transformed into type-VIII phase after the sample has been heated to 185 °C. Type-VIII BGS is stable during heating and cooling, but type-VIII Ba8Ga15CuSn30decomposes into Sn and Ba(Ga/Sn)4during cooling. Meanwhile, the electrical properties of type-I samples are measured, their electrical conductivities are enhanced, and the Seebeck efficient is reduced with Cu substitution.

Soc.,"A concise and efficient one-pot synthesis of multi-halogen pyrazino[1,2-a]indole-1,8(2H,5aH)-dione (MHPID) derivatives by the reaction of an enamino ester with multi-halogen benzoquinone derivatives is described. MHPIDs 3a–3d were obtained with good yields (78–83%) by refluxing enamino esters 1a and 1b and tetrahalogen-1,4-benzoquinones 2a and 2b for 24 h without the use of catalysts. Compounds 3e– 3p were also obtained with excellent yields (69–92%) via the reaction of the phenyl-substituted enamino esters 1c–1h with tetrahalogen-1,4-benzoquinones 2a and 2b in CH3CN catalyzed by Cs2CO3.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Commun., ICC","The breakthrough progress of wireless charging technology provides a significant opportunity to solve the energy constrained problem in wireless sensor networks. However, most of existing mobile energy replenishment schemes either cannot well adapt to the high diversity of energy consumption or leave out of consideration about the fairness of charging response, and thus may still suffer from non-negligible performance degradation resulted from energy starvation. Particularly when there is a large number of charging requirements, the energy starvation may bring about quite a number of sensor nodes invalid due to energy depletion. In this paper, we explore the energy starvation issue while provisioning energy for wireless sensor networks and propose a Starvation Avoidance Mobile Energy Replenishment scheme (SAMER) which can avoid energy starvation through calculating and considering the maximum tolerable latency of each charging requirement. The simulation results show that SAMER scheme can effectively solve the energy starvation problem and achieve efficient mobile energy supplement for wireless sensor networks. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163302714825,7510769,"Feng, Yong (1); Liu, Nianbo (2); Wang, Feng (1); Qian, Qian (1); Li, Xiuqi (1) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Computer Technology Applications, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan; 610054, China ",,"525.3 Energy Utilization - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 961 Systems Science",122715.0,"May 22, 2016 - May 27, 2016","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2016",Energy utilization - Sensor nodes - Wireless sensor networks,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICC.2016.7510769,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 71161015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61262081, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: ZYGX2012J083, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants no. 61262081 and 71161015. the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grants no.

Int. J. Heat Mass Transf.,"A hydrodynamics of deionized water flowing through the micro heat sinks with cavities and ribs are investigated experimentally. The Reynolds number ranges from 70 to 320. Using micro particle image velocimetry (Micro-PIV) and numerical simulation, velocity and vector fields are both obtained. The comparative results show that the distribution of centerline velocity changes periodically, which shows good agreement between simulations and experiments. Moreover, the vortices easily form in the cavities zones if the kinetic energy and negative pressure gradient exhaust along the flow direction. The physical mechanism of heat transfer enhancement is explained from the view point of fluid flow. The main reasons can ascribe that the heat transfer area and flow turbulence increase due to the existent of cavities and ribs under small Reynolds number; the secondary flow is helpful for mixing the cold and hot fluid in cavities zones as well as the increased turbulence in ribs zones under high Reynolds number. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20162802590088,,"Zhai, Yuling (1, 2, 3); Xia, Guodong (1); Chen, Zhuo (1); Li, Zhouhang (2, 3) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing; 100124, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China ",IJHMAK,"445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments",,,,,Deionized water - Electroosmosis - Heat sinks - Heat transfer coefficients - Kinetic energy - Kinetics - Reynolds number - Turbulence - Velocity measurement,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xia, Guodong(xgd@bjut.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.03.044,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 3142004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; Number: 10978169, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 10978193, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51576005, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51576005 ), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 3142004 ), and the Recruitment Program of High-level Talents, Kunming University of Science and Technology (Nos. 10978193 , 10978169 ).",,00179310,,"July 1, 2016",English,Vortex flow,,24.0,380-389,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,,Micro-PIV study of flow and the formation of vortex in micro heat sinks with cavities and ribs,,Centerline velocity - Heat transfer area - Heat Transfer enhancement - High Reynolds number - Micro heat sink - Micro particle image velocimetry - Micro PIV - Physical mechanism,98
Knowl Based Syst,"Social media systems provide ever-growing huge volumes of information for dissemination and communication among communities of users, while recommender systems aim to mitigate information overload by filtering and providing users the most attractive and relevant items from information-sea. This paper aims at providing compound recommendation engine for social media systems, and focuses on exploiting multi-sourced information (e.g. social networks, item contents and user feedbacks) to predict the ratings of users to items and make recommendations. For this, we suppose the users' decisions on adopting item are affected both by their tastes and the favors of trusted friends, and extend Collaborative Topic Regression to jointly incorporates social trust ensemble, topic modeling and probabilistic matrix factorization. We propose corresponding approaches to learning the latent factors both of users and items, as well as additional parameters to be estimated. Empirical experiments on Lastfm and Delicious datasets show that our model is better and more robust than the state-of-the-art methods on making recommendations in term of accuracy.

J Power Sources,"Precious platinum counter electrode (CE) has been an economic burden for future commercialization of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Low-platinum alloy CE catalysts are promising in bringing down the solar cell cost without reducing photovoltaic performances. We present here a facile strategy of fabricating ZnO nanorods assisted platinum-nickel (PtNi) alloy microtube CEs for liquid-junction DSSCs. By adjusting the concentration of zinc precursors, the ZnO nanostructures and therefore PtNi alloys are optimized to maximize the electrocatalytic behaviors toward triiodide reduction reaction. The maximal power conversion efficiency is determined as high as 8.43% for liquid-junction DSSC device with alloyed PtNi microtube CE synthesized at 75 mM Zn(NO3)2aqueous solution, yielding a 32.8% enhancement in cell efficiency in comparison with the solar cell from pristine platinum electrode. Moreover, the dissolution resistance and charge-transfer ability toward redox couples have also been markedly enhanced due to competitive dissolution reactions and alloyed effects. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20163302715375,,"Wang, Jing (1); Tang, Qunwei (1); He, Benlin (1); Yang, Peizhi (2) ","(1) Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao; 266100, China (2) Key Laboratory of Advanced Technique & Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",JPSODZ,546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 548.2 Nickel Alloys - 615.2 Solar Power - 702.3 Solar Cells - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Binary alloys - Charge transfer - Dissolution - Efficiency - Electrocatalysts - Electrodes - II-VI semiconductors - Nanorods - Nickel alloys - Platinum alloys - Redox reactions - Solar cells - Solar power generation - Solutions - Zinc alloys - Zinc oxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Qunwei(tangqunwei@ouc.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.08.029,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: ZR2015EM024, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Number: 05300205020516009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1037604, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21503202, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors acknowledge financial supports from National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21503202 , U1037604 ), Collaborative Innovation Center of Research and Development of Renewable Energy in the Southwest Area ( 05300205020516009 ), and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation ( ZR2015EM024 ).

Anal. Chem.,"A novel and simple electrochemical immunoassay for C-reactive protein was developed using metal-organic frameworks (Au-MOFs) as signal unit. In this study, we found MOFs could be used as signal probe. And this new class of signal probe differs from traditional probe. The signal of the copper ions (Cu2+) from MOFs could be directly detected without acid dissolution and preconcentration, which would greatly simplify the detection steps and reduce the detection time. Moreover, MOFs contain large amounts of Cu2+ions, providing high electrochemical signals. Our report represents the first example of using MOFs themselves as electrochemical signal probe for biosensors. Platinum nanoparticle modified covalent organic frameworks (Pt-COFs) with high electronic conductivity was employed as the substrate, which is the first time demonstrating the use of Pt-COFs for electrochemical immunoassay. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the proposed sensing strategy provides a linear dynamic ranging from 1 to 400 ng/mL. A detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL was obtained, indicating an improved analytical performance. With these merits, this stable, simple, low-cost, sensitive and selective electrochemical immunoassay shows promise for applications in the point-of-care diagnostics of dieses and environmental monitoring. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,20181705037035,,"Liu, Ting-Zhi (1); Hu, Rong (1); Zhang, Xi (1); Zhang, Kun-Lei (1); Liu, Yi (1); Zhang, Xiao-Bing (2); Bai, Ru-Yan (1); Li, Delei (1); Yang, Yun-Hui (1) ","(1) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Yunnan, Kunming; 650092, China (2) Molecular Science and Biomedicine Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Molecular Engineering for Theronastics, Hunan University, Changsha; 410082, China ",ANCHAM,461.9.1 Immunology - 531.1 Metallurgy - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Crystalline materials - Immunology - Metal ions - Organic polymers - Organometallics - Substrates,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hu, Rong(hudierong_168@163.com) ",10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04191,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15206882,"Number: 20975034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21465026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21275044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21165023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: J1210040, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21177036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21605130, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 01100205020503104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011CB911000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 21465026, 21165023, J1210040, 20975034, 21177036, 21275044, and 21605130) and the National Key Scientific Program of China (2011CB911000, 01100205020503104).",,00032700,24,2016,English,Probes,,43.0,12516-12523,,2016,American Chemical Society,Analytical Chemistry,,Metal-organic framework nanomaterials as novel signal probes for electron transfer mediated ultrasensitive electrochemical immunoassay,,Covalent organic frameworks - Electrochemical immunoassays - Electrochemical signals - Environmental Monitoring - Experimental conditions - Metal organic framework - Platinum nano-particles - Point of care diagnostic,88
Hydrometallurgy,"In this study, copper and nickel in ammoniacal/ammonium chloride solutions were separated by using an extractant mixture of Acorga M5640 and trialkylphosphine oxide (TRPO). The effects of contact time, Acorga M5640 concentration, modifier concentration, total ammonia concentration, and phase ratio on the extraction and separation of both metals were determined. The addition of TRPO into Acorga M5640 organic phase exerted antagonistic effects on copper and nickel extractions. The antagonistic effect of the extractant mixture was significantly stronger on the extraction of nickel than on that of copper. More than 99.96% of copper and less than 6.6% of nickel were extracted using a mixture of 10 vol.% Acorga M5640 and 2 vol.% TRPO in kerosene from an ammoniacal solution initially containing 3.0 g/L each of copper and nickel under optimal extraction conditions.

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"Heteroscedasticity testing is of importance in regression analysis. Existing local smoothing tests suffer severely from curse of dimensionality even when the number of covariates is moderate because of use of nonparametric estimation. A dimension reduction-based model adaptive test is proposed which behaves like a local smoothing test as if the number of covariates was equal to the number of their linear combinations in the mean regression function, in particular, equal to 1 when the mean function contains a single index. The test statistic is asymptotically normal under the null hypothesis such that critical values are easily determined. The finite sample performances of the test are examined by simulations and a real data analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162502521911,,"Zhu, Xuehu (1, 4); Chen, Fei (3); Guo, Xu (5, 6); Zhu, Lixing (2, 4) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'An Jiaotong University, China (2) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Suzhou University of Science and Technology, China (3) School of Statistics and Mathematics, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, China (4) Department of Mathematics, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong (5) School of Statistics, Beijing Normal University, China (6) College of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China ",CSDADW,922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Sampling - Statistical tests,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Lixing(lzhu@hkbu.edu.hk) ",10.1016/j.csda.2016.04.009,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: CUHK, Sponsor: Chinese University of Hong Kong; Number: BK20150732, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: 11261064, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11401465, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Lixing Zhu was supported by a grant from the University Grants Council of Hong Kong , Hong Kong, China.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"This work reports a novel method for the determination of aconitine through the competitive host-guest interaction between p-sulfonated calix[8]arene (SCX8) and signal probe/target molecules by using SCX8 functionalized reduced graphene oxide (SCX8-RGO) as a receptor. Three dyes (ST, RhB, BRB) and aconitine were selected as the probe and target molecules, respectively. The formation of SCX8-RGO·ST, SCX8-RGO·RhB, and SCX8-RGO·BRB complexes greatly decreases the fluorescence emission of ST, RhB, and BRB. The aconitine/SCX8 complex possesses a higher binding constant than ST/SCX8, RhB/SCX8, and BRB/SCX8 complexes, thus the dye in the SCX8 cavity can be replaced by aconitine to revert the fluorescence emission of SCX8-RGO·dye, leading to a 'switch-on' fluorescence response. The fluorescence intensity of SCX8-RGO·ST, SCX8-RGO·RhB, and SCX8-RGO·BRB complexes increased linearly with increasing concentration of aconitine ranging from 1.0 to 14.0 μM, 2.0-16.0 μM, and 1.0-16.0 μM, respectively. Based on the competitive host-guest interaction, the proposed detection method for aconitine showed detection limits of 0.28 μM, 0.60 μM, and 0.37 μM, respectively, and was successfully applied for the determination of aconitine in human serum samples with good recoveries from 95.1% to 104.8%. The proposed method showed high selectivity for aconitine beyond competitive binding analytes. In addition, the inclusion complex of the SCX8/aconitine was studied by the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, which indicated that the phenyl ester group of the aconitine molecule was included into the SCX8 cavity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20161602258429,,"Yang, Long (1); Xie, Xiaoguang (1); Cai, Le (1); Ran, Xin (1); Li, Yucong (1); Yin, Tianpeng (1); Zhao, Hui (2); Li, Can-Peng (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",BBIOE4,741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Graphene - Molecular dynamics - Molecules - Probes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Hui(zhaohui@yun.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,"Number: 2014RA022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21565029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31160334, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21565029 and 31160334 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2014RA022 ), People's Republic of China.

J. Cent. South Univ.,"The exothermic efficiency of microwave heating an electrolyte/water solution is remarkably high due to the dielectric heating by orientation polarization of water and resistance heating by the Joule process occurred simultaneously compared with pure water. A three-dimensional finite element numerical model of multi-feed microwave heating industrial liquids continuously flowing in a meter-scale circular tube is presented. The temperature field inside the applicator tube in the cavity is solved by COMSOL Multiphysics and professional programming to describe the momentum, energy and Maxwell’s equations. The evaluations of the electromagnetic field, the temperature distribution and the velocity field are simulated for the fluids dynamically heated by single- and multi-feed microwave system, respectively. Both the pilot experimental investigations and numerical results of microwave with single-feed heating for fluids with different effective permittivity and flow rates show that the presented numerical modeling makes it possible to analyze dynamic process of multi-feed microwave heating the industrial liquid. The study aids in enhancing the understanding and optimizing of dynamic process in the use of multi-feed microwave heating industrial continuous flow for a variety of material properties and technical parameters. © 2016, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20170503299436,,"Yang, Biao (1, 2, 3); Sun, Jun (1, 2, 3); Li, Wei (2, 3, 4); Peng, Jin-hui (2, 3); Li, You-ling (5); Luo, Hui-long (2, 3); Guo, Sheng-hui (2, 3); Zhang, Zhu-ming (5); Su, He-zhou (5); Shi, Ya-ming (5) ","(1) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Engineering Laboratory of Microwave Application and Equipment Technology of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (4) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (5) Kunming Iron & Steel Holding Co., Ltd., Kunming; 650302, China ",,642.1 Process Heating - 701 Electricity and Magnetism - 702 Electric Batteries and Fuel Cells - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 714.1 Electron Tubes - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Electrolytes - Electromagnetic fields - Finite element method - Maxwell equations - Microwave tubes - Microwaves - Numerical models - Velocity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Peng, Jin-hui(Jhpeng_ok@Yeah.net) ",10.1007/s11771-016-3385-5,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22275223,,,,20952899,12,"December 1, 2016",English,Microwave materials processing,,27.0,3192-3203,,2016,Central South University of Technology,Journal of Central South University,,Numerical modeling dynamic process of multi-feed microwave heating of industrial solution media,,Dynamical process - Effective permittivity - Experimental investigations - Industrial flows - Multi-feed - Numerical computations - Professional programming - Three dimensional finite elements,23
Colloids Surf. A Physicochem. Eng. Asp.,"Both mechanical and chemical durability of superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces are very important properties for industrial applications. In this paper, the durability of the Ultra-Ever Dry, as a commercial SH product, sprayed onto low carbon steel has been systematically studied by sand paper abrasion, waterfall/jet test and immersion in solution of different pH values as well as salt spray test. The results show that the degeneration of superhydrophobicity of the coating during the abrasion was mainly due to the loss of both the top layer of micro-scale bumps and their nanoparticles (NPs). Waterfall/jet impact could also cause the loss of NPs on the micro-scale bumps of the coating, which corresponds with the change of wettability. Different chemical processes elicit complex effects on the SH Surface. The coating is able to maintain its superhydrophobicity in solutions of pH 1-12, whereas a solution of pH 14 causes both chemical change and loss of NPs, and as a result, the loss of the water-repellent property. The salt spray test shows that the pitting corrosion on the surface and the degeneration of superhydrophobicity are mainly induced by morphological and surface chemical changes such as the formation of new Fe-O nanostructures that presented as pit-etching on the coating surface. The results also confirm that surperhydrophobictity degeneration of the SH coating surface by salt spray can be easily recovered through treatment with fluoroalkylsilane (FAS-17). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20160902043893,,"Wang, Li (1, 2); Yang, Jieyi (2, 4, 5); Zhu, Yan (1); Li, Zhenhua (1); Sheng, Tao (1); Hu, Y.M.

J. Hydrol.,"Water diversion has been applied increasingly to promote the exchange of lake water and to control eutrophication of lakes. The accelerated water exchange and mass transport by water diversion can usually be represented by water age. But the responses of water quality after water diversion is still disputed. The reliability of using water age for evaluating the effectiveness of water diversion projects in eutrophic lakes should be thereby explored further. Lake Dianchi, a semi-closed plateau lake in China, has suffered severe eutrophication since the 1980s, and it is one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China. There was no significant improvement in water quality after an investment of approximately 7.7 billion USD and numerous project efforts from 1996 to 2015. After the approval of the Chinese State Council, water has been transferred to Lake Dianchi to alleviate eutrophication since December 2013. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model and eight scenarios were developed in this study to quantity the influence of this water diversion project on water quality in Lake Dianchi. The model results showed that (a) Water quality (TP, TN, and Chla) could be improved by 13.5–32.2%, much lower than the approximate 50% reduction in water age; (b) Water exchange had a strong positive relationship with mean TP, and mean Chla had exactly the same response to water diversion as mean TN; (c) Water level was more beneficial for improving hydrodynamic and nutrient concentrations than variation in the diverted inflowing water volume; (d) The water diversion scenario of doubling the diverted inflow rate in the wet season with the water level of 1886.5 m and 1887 m in the remaining months was the best water diversion mode for mean hydrodynamics and TP, but the scenario of doubling the diverted inflow rate in the wet season with 1887 m throughout the year was optimum for mean TN and Chla; (e) Water age influenced the effectiveness of water diversion on the improvement in TP, but not in TN and Chla. Therefore, water age solely could not be used to evaluate the restoration of water quality in a eutrophic lake, because geobiochemical processes played a more important role in the growth of algae than did water exchange in Lake Dianchi. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20164603007976,,"Zhang, Xiaoling (1); Zou, Rui (2, 3); Wang, Yilin (1); Liu, Yong (1); Zhao, Lei (3); Zhu, Xiang (3); Guo, Huaicheng (1) ","(1) College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (MOE), Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Tetra Tech, Inc., 10306 Eaton PlaceSte 340, Fairfax; VA; 22030, United States (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China ",JHYDA7,442.1 Flood Control - 445.2 Water Analysis - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control,,,,,Flood control - Hydrodynamics - Lakes - Quality control - Water levels - Water quality,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Yong(yongliu@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.09.002,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013ZX07102-006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 201506010235, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Cornell University; Number: 2015CB458900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CICREQ, Sponsor: Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality; ","This paper was supported by the China National Water Pollution Control Program ( 2013ZX07102-006 ), the National Basic Research Program of China ( 2015CB458900 ), the China Scholarship Council (No. 201506010235 ) and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality .

In searching for cost-effective CEs without sacrificing electrochemical activities, here we report the experimental realization of ZnO nanorods assisted Ni1.1Pt and Co3.9Pt alloy microtube (MT) CEs by combining a simple electrodeposition deposition on aligned ZnO nanorods and a galvanic displacement reaction. On behalf of the good charge-transfer ability along one-dimensional alloy electrocatalyst and electrocatalytic activity toward liquid electrolyte, the resultant DSSCs with Ni1.1Pt and Co3.9Pt MT CEs display promising power conversion efficiencies of 8.29% and 7.73%, yielding 30.6% and 21.7% enhancements, respectively. Similarly importantly, the alloyed CEs are still scalable, other alloyed low-Pt or non-Pt nano/microstructures can also be realized using the method reported here. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrochim Acta,"Binder-free NiO@MnO2core-shell structure was deposited on Ni foam used as electrode of supercapacitor. The rod-like NiO core was prepared by thermal decomposition of NiC2O4synthesized by corrosion of Ni foam with oxalic acid under hydrothermal conditions. Sphere-like MnO2shell was deposited on the surface of NiO core through hydrothermal treatment with KMnO4solution. The structure, composition, morphology evolution and surface chemical state of the NiO@MnO2electrode were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The obtained NiO and NiO@MnO2electrodes were directly used as electrodes of supercapacitor, and their electrochemical performances were tested with cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the sphere-like MnO2shell leads to an impressive enhancement of the performance including the areal capacitance (AC) and cycling stability, particular in the AC. To be more specific, the NiO@MnO2exhibits a high AC of 3.584 F/cm2at a current density of 5 mA/cm2, which is much higher than that of NiO electrode whose AC is 1.483 F/cm2at the same current density, demonstrating the potential to use NiO@MnO2electrode for supercapacitor. At the same time, the related mechanisms for the superior performance were also discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Math. Probl. Eng.,"This study used the Segment Tracing Algorithm (STA) to extract lineaments from remotely sensed images. A computer program was then written to calculate the lineament densities and lengths. In Gaosong field, 3,233 lineaments were extracted based on a 200 m × 200 m grid size. The results indicate that most lineaments lengths are between 30 m and 50 m, and the number of lineaments within each cell ranges from 1 to 6. Areas with high distributions exist on both sides of the central region. According to the contour map of lineament length, the maximum lineament length is 380 m, and the minimum length is 30 m. The contours mainly extend in two directions, including NE and NW trends. This is consistent with the prominent NE and NW strike faults that prevail in the mining area. The results are similar to those obtained in the Machishui ore block, which has become a mine production area. High values of lineament length and density in the contour map of Gaosong field may be associated with hydrothermal tin mineralization in the study area. The results of this study potentially provide a new approach to mineral exploration in the early stage of geological prospecting. © 2016 Chunzhong Ni et al.",Open Access,20164202925279,5392453,"Ni, Chunzhong (1); Zhang, Shitao (1); Liu, Chunxue (2); Yan, Yongfeng (1); Li, Yujian (1) ","(1) Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650003, China (2) School of Urban and Environment, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China ",,481.1 Geology - 501.1 Exploration and Prospecting Methods - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines,,,,,Image segmentation - Mineral exploration - Tin mines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ni, Chunzhong(281262717@qq.com) ",10.1155/2016/5392453,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15635147,,,,1024123X,,2016,English,Structural geology,,26.0,,,2016,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,"Lineament Length and Density Analyses Based on the Segment Tracing Algorithm: A Case Study of the Gaosong Field in Gejiu Tin Mine, China",,Geological prospecting - Mine production - Mining areas - New approaches - Remotely sensed images - Tin mineralizations - Tracing algorithm - Two directions,2016

Linear Algebra Its Appl,"In many practical problems, the underlying structure of an estimated covariance matrix is usually blurred due to random noise, particularly when the dimension of the matrix is high. Hence, it is necessary to filter the random noise or regularize the available covariance matrix in certain senses, so that the covariance structure becomes clear. In this paper, we propose a new method for regularizing the covariance structure of a given covariance matrix. By choosing an optimal structure from an available class of covariance structures, the regularization is made in terms of minimizing the discrepancy, defined by Frobenius-norm, between the given covariance matrix and the class of covariance structures. A range of potential candidate structures, including the order-1 moving average structure, compound symmetry structure, order-1 autoregressive structure, order-1 autoregressive moving average structure, are considered. Simulation studies show that the proposed new approach is reliable in regularization of covariance structures. The proposed approach is also applied to real data analysis in signal processing, showing the usefulness of the proposed approach in practice. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,20164102884820,,"Cui, Xiangzhao (1); Li, Chun (1); Zhao, Jine (1); Zeng, Li (1); Zhang, Defei (1); Pan, Jianxin (2) ","(1) School of Mathematics, Honghe University, Yunnan, China (2) School of Mathematics, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom ",LAAPAW,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921 Mathematics - 921.5 Optimization Techniques,,,,,Signal processing - Structural optimization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pan, Jianxin(Jianxin.Pan@manchester.ac.uk) ",10.1016/j.laa.2016.08.013,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,00243795,,"December 1, 2016",English,Covariance matrix,,18.0,124-145,,2016,Elsevier Inc.,Linear Algebra and Its Applications,,Covariance structure regularization via Frobenius-norm discrepancy,,Autoregressive moving average - Covariance estimation - Covariance structures - F norms - Optimal structures - Practical problems - Regularization - Symmetry structures,510
Environ. Earth Sci.,"The dry-hot valley region (DHV) in southwestern China is one of the most ecologically fragile zones in China with intensive soil erosion. Few studies have focused on the effects of soil erosion on soil productivity in this region. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of soil erosion on soil productivity using the ‘soil erosion class’ method. The degree of soil erosion was investigated at 44 monitoring sites in typical DHV catchments, and soil physicochemical properties, and corn yield at each site were monitored. The results showed that soil productivity was significantly affected by soil erosion in the DHV. As the degree of soil erosion progressed from ‘slight’ to ‘moderate’ to ‘severe,’ organic matter content decreased 15.29, 18.00, and 27.37 %, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen—0.06, 6.03, and 9.45 %, and available potassium content—7.07, 41.79, and 43.32 %, respectively. Compared with the ‘no’ erosion site, the decreases in the mean corn seed yields were 1.56 % for ‘slight,’ 29.18 % for ‘moderate,’ and 35.03 % for ‘severe’ erosion. These results indicated that once the erosion reached ‘moderate’ levels, significant reductions in soil productivity were present. The declining slope of corn seed yields was 0.13 Mg ha−1 cm−1of topsoil loss. The estimated mean for the absolute corn loss was 0.01 Mg ha−1 year−1in the DHV. These results increased the understanding of the mechanism of soil degradation processes in the DHV and will be instrumental in developing a strategy for ecological restoration. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20163302719620,1164,"Duan, Xingwu (1); Liu, Bing (2); Gu, Zhijia (3); Rong, Li (1); Feng, Detai (3) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of International Rivers and Trans-Boundary Eco-Security, Yunnan University, Kunming; 10095, China (2) China institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, Beijing; 100038, China (3) Institute of International Rivers and Eco-Security, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics,,,,,Catchments - Erosion - Landforms - Productivity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Duan, Xingwu(xwduan@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s12665-016-5986-6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18666299,,,,18666280,16,"August 1, 2016",English,Soils,,47.0,,,2016,Springer Verlag,Environmental Earth Sciences,,"Quantifying soil erosion effects on soil productivity in the dry-hot valley, southwestern China",,Dry-hot valleys - Land degradation - Red River - Soil erosion - Soil physico-chemical properties,75

Water Sci. Technol.,"The effects of solid-state NaOH pretreatment on the efficiency of methane production from semi-dry anaerobic digestion of rose (Rosa rugosa) stalk were investigated at various NaOH loadings (0, 1, 2, and 4% (w/w)). Methane production, process stability and energy balance were analyzed. Results showed that solid-state NaOH pretreatment significantly improved biogas and methane yields of 30- day anaerobic digestion, with increases from 143.7 mL/g volatile solids (VS) added to 157.1 mL/g VS -192.1 mL/g VS added and from 81.8 mL/g VS added to 88.8 mL/g VS-117.7 mL/g VS added, respectively. Solid-state NaOH pretreatment resulted in anaerobic digestion with higher VS reduction and lower technical digestion time. The 4% NaOH-treated group had the highest methane yield of 117.7 mL/g VS added, which was 144% higher compared to the no NaOH-treated group, and the highest net energy recovery. Higher rate of lignocellulose breakage and higher process stability of anaerobic digestion facilitated methane production in the NaOH-pretreated groups. © IWA Publishing 2016.",,20162602545619,,"Liang, Yue-Gan (1, 2); Cheng, Beijiu (2); Si, You-Bin (1); Cao, De-Ju (1); Li, Dao-Lin (1); Chen, Jian-Feng (3) ","(1) School of Resource and Environment, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei; 230036, China (2) Key Laboratory of Biomass Improvement and Conversion of Anhui Province, School of Life Sciences, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei; 230036, China (3) Agricultural Environment and Resources Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming; 650205, China ",WSTED4,804.1 Organic Compounds - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity,,,,,Energy balance - Methane - Sodium hydroxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cheng, Beijiu(cbj@ahau.edu.cn) ",10.2166/wst.2016.145,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 1508085SMB210, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province; Number: 2012ZX07102-003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",The financial support for this study was provided by the Major Science and Technology Program forWater Pollution Control and Treatment (2012ZX07102-003) and Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (1508085SMB210).

Artificial management of digital information has been unable to adapt to the development of society, therefore, efficient management and accurate positioning technology of the mass of information has become research hot spots of many research groups. The work proposed in this paper is application and twice extraction of information basing on singular value decomposition. This approach will use the singular value decomposition for the train matrix, modify the eigenvalue by comparison algorithm, generate new train matrix, and then use the principal component analysis of secondary data processing.

Xiyou Jinshu,"The paper introduced a method of improving the flotation indexes of nickel concentrate on the premise of that the grinding and flotation process remained the same. Based on the mechanical property of ore, the accurate ball-load-addition method was adopted to calculate the optimum ball diameter of initial installation ball and ball ratio accurately at the second stage grinding and eventually determined the initial installation scheme of Φ40:Φ30:Φ20=40:40:20. According to the requirement of fine grinding at the second stage and the mass equivalent principle, steel balls were replaced by cylpebs and the medium charge scheme was eventually determined as D (diameter)×L (length) 35×40:30×35:25×30=30:30:40. In addition, some other schemes were designed to make a contrast with the method. The results proved that the particle-size composition of grinding product tended to be more reasonable after optimizing the ball diameter and the proportion. That was to say, the over-coarse and over-ground proportions decreased significantly, and the easy selection grade increased apparently for the enhanced selective disintegration. The further commercial-scale manufacture verified that the grinding fineness increased by 8.68% after using new grinding medium. At the end of the experiment, expected results could be obtained that the nickel recovery increased by 2.53%, the copper recovery increased by 4.99%, the nickel concentrate grade increased by 0.36% and the copper concentrate grade increased by 3.65%, and the amount of MgO in the nickel concentrate decreased by 9.16%. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol.,"Exophiala pisciphila is a cadmium-tolerant fungus, and produces 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin which can be inhibited by tricyclazole. Tricyclazole at higher levels (20 and 40 μg mL-1) reduced the growth and sporulation of E. pisciphila, but toxicity was not observed at a low concentration (2.5 μg mL-1). Under cadmium (Cd) stress (50, 100 and 200 mg L-1), 2.5 μg mL-1of tricyclazole reduced fungal growth and sporulation. These reduces indicated a decrease on Cd tolerance of E. pisciphila. For both the 0 and 2.5 μg mL-1tricyclazole treatments, Cd was associated mostly with cell walls and was extracted by 2 % acetic acid and 1 M NaCl. The FTIR spectra of the E. pisciphila mycelia were similar for both 0 and 2.5 μg mL-1tricyclazole treatments, which showed hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl and phosphate groups. Thus inhibition of melanin synthesis by tricyclazole did not change Cd accumulation characteristics in E. pisciphila. Results suggested that melanin played a protective role for E. pisciphila against Cd stress, but inhibition of melanin synthesis did not have a remarkable impact on Cd accumulation in E. pisciphila. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media.",,20154301433588,,"Zhan, Fangdong (1, 2); He, Yongmei (1); Yang, Yiyan (3); Li, Yuan (1); Li, Tao (2); Zhao, Zhiwei (2) ","(1) College of Resources and Environment, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China (2) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources of the Ministry of Education, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Environmental Monitoring Station of Dali State, Dali; 671000, China ",BECTA6,549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Biosynthesis - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Growth (materials) - Melanin - Plants (botany) - Sodium chloride,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Zhiwei(zhaozhw@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s00128-015-1676-4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320800,"Number: 09Z0037, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1202236, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41461093, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31460114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41101486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41101486, 41461093, 31460114 and U1202236), and Key Research Project of Education Bureau of Yunnan Province, China (No. 09Z0037).",,00074861,2,January 2016,English,Cadmium,,46.0,235-241,,2016,Springer New York LLC,Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,,"Effects of Tricyclazole on Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation Characteristics of a Dark Septate Endophyte (DSE), Exophiala pisciphila",,Accumulation characteristics - Cadmium tolerance - Cd accumulation - Exophiala pisciphila - Low concentrations - Melanin synthesis - Remarkable impact - Tricyclazole,96
Adv. Mater. Sci. Eng.,"In order to improve the spalling resistance of lightweight aggregate concrete at high temperature, two types of modified materials were used to modify clay ceramsite lightweight aggregates by adopting the surface coating modification method. Spalling of the concrete specimens manufactured by using the modified aggregates was observed during a temperature elevation. Mass loss and residual axial compressive strength of the modified concrete specimens after exposure to elevated temperatures were also tested. Concrete specimens consisting of ordinary clay ceramsites and crushed limestone were manufactured as references for comparison. The results showed that the ordinary lightweight concrete specimens and the crushed limestone concrete specimens were completely spalled after exposure to target temperatures above 400°C and 1000°C, respectively, whereas the modified concrete specimens remained intact at 1200°C, at which approximately 25% to 38% of the residual compressive strength was retained. The results indicated that the modified lightweight concrete specimens have exhibited superior mechanical properties and resistance to thermal spalling after exposure to elevated temperatures. © 2016 Ke-cheng He et al.",Open Access,20162502527466,5972570,"He, Ke-Cheng (1, 2); Guo, Rong-Xin (1, 2); Ma, Qian-Min (1, 2); Yan, Feng (1, 2); Lin, Zhi-Wei (1); Sun, Yan-Lin (3) ","(1) Faculty of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Key Lab of Yunnan Higher Education, Institutes for Mechanical Behavior and Microstructure Design of Advanced Materials, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (3) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",,406 Highway Engineering - 412 Concrete - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Aggregates - Compressive strength - Concrete aggregates - Lime - Limestone - Spalling,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Guo, Rong-Xin(guorx@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1155/2016/5972570,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),16878442,,,,16878434,,2016,English,Light weight concrete,,19.0,,,2016,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Advances in Materials Science and Engineering,,Experimental Research on High Temperature Resistance of Modified Lightweight Concrete after Exposure to Elevated Temperatures,,Axial compressive strength - Experimental research - High temperature resistance - Light weight aggregate - Light-weight aggregate concrete - Modification methods - Residual compressive strength - Temperature elevation,2016

Huanjing Kexue,"The gas and particle samples of eight cities were collected by high flow active air sampler in the Eastern and Western China and eight congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers were analyzed. The results showed that the concentration of BDE-28 (tri-BDE) in the gas-phase (three bromide components) was the highest, which was different from previous studies where BDE-99 and-47 were the predominant homologues in the gas-phase while the concentration of BDE-209 [(25.4±124) pg·m-3] in particle-phase was the highest. The atmospheric concentrations of PBDEs in Beijing and Guangzhou were relatively higher, especially the BDE-209 concentration in particle phases of Guangzhou was two orders higher than those of other cities. However, the atmospheric concentrations of PBDEs declined significantly when compared with the data from previous studies. Meanwhile, the results indicated that the gas-phase concentrations decreased slowly and the particle-phase concentrations decreased rapidly. Combined with the results of correlation analysis, this phenomenon might be ascribed to the ceased commercial production of penta-and octa-BDE, the light degradation of high bromide components and reduced concentrations of atmospheric particles in urban area. Inhalation exposure for infants was about 2-3 times higher than that of adults. This reflected that the potential health risk of atmospheric PBDEs in city for residents, especially infants and young children, should not be ignored. © 2016, Science Press.

Mar. Pollut. Bull.,"Surface sediment samples were collected from upstream down to the subaqueous delta of the Red River in Vietnam to assess heavy metal pollution. Sediment Cr and V concentrations are strongly correlated with Al, Fe, Mn and total organic carbon concentrations, as well as particle size, suggesting that these two metals are derived primarily from natural sources and enriched in the fine fraction of sediments. In contrast, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni and Zn concentrations show weaker correlations with particle size, with very high concentrations observed at several sites in the upper reach of the river, pointing to anthropogenic input as a possible source of these heavy metals. Enrichment factors (EF) of Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni and Zn suggest that heavy metal pollution is present in sediments with significantly high values in the upstream. The data analysis indicates that Cd, Cu and Pb are the dominant pollutants in the Red River, with their concentrations reaching moderate to serious pollution levels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20165103133697,,"Nguyen, Thi Thu Hien (1, 2); Zhang, Weiguo (1); Li, Zhen (3); Li, Jie (4); Ge, Can (1); Liu, Jinyan (1); Bai, Xuexin (1); Feng, Huan (5); Yu, Lizhong (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai; 200062, China (2) Institute of Geography, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Viet Nam (3) School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of Victoria, Victoria; BC; V8P5C2, Canada (4) Yunnan Institute of Environmental Science, Kunming; 650034, China (5) Department of Earth and Environmental Studies, Montclair State University, NJ; 07043, United States ",MPNBAZ,453 Water Pollution - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Heavy metals - Organic carbon - Particle size - Rivers - Sediments - Surficial sediments,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Weiguo(wgzhang@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.08.030,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18793363,"Number: 2012KYYW01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Space Medicine Fundamentals and Application, China Astronaut Research and Training Center; Number: 41271223, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to thank Dr. Bruce J.

Biotechnol. Biotechnol. Equip.,"Haploid, diploid and tetraploid shoots of Echinacea purpurea L. sharing the same genome were cultured in medium and their rooting response to the composition of the culture medium was investigated. It was found that in medium without growth regulators, haploid shoots could initiate roots quite efficiently with the shortest time required for the emergence of roots and with the highest rooting rate; the response of the diploids was similar to that of the haploids and largely different from that of the tetraploids. The tetraploids obviously required longer time for the initiation of roots and had the lowest rooting rate. Supplementing the medium with 0.05 and 0.15 mg/L naphthaleneacetic acid or 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) had little positive effect on the rooting of diploid shoots and, in some cases, had even negative effect on the rooting of haploid shoots, but enhanced effectively the rooting of the tetraploid shoots. By supplementing the medium with 0.3 mg/L IBA, the time required for the emergence of roots from the tetraploid shoots was shortened and the rooting rate was increased largely. As a result, healthy tetraploid plantlets with fully developed root system could be efficiently propagated. © 2015 The Author(s).

Nongye Jixie Xuebao,"Through analyzing requirements of injection control of high pressure common rail diesel engine, the air intake system had obvious hysteresis in the changing speed. And this kind of hysteretic performance was represented that the increment of the intake-air could not obviously keep pace with the increment of the injection. Thus, the designed correction algorithm of main injection quantity for changing speed could newly modify the original main injection fuel quantity, and obtain the reasonable air-fuel ratio and optimize the combustion process. For the fluctuation of common rail pressure was caused by the multiple injection, the fuel correction algorithm of multiple injection for common rail pressure fluctuation could pre-rectify the fuel injection pulse width and improve the injection accuracy, which were realized by using the ASCET modeling software tools of ETAS company and the independently developed ECU circuit board. After calibration experiment of the engine on YN33CR high pressure common rail diesel engine, such as starting and idling condition test, main injection quantity correction test of changing speed, fuel correction test of multiple injection for rail pressure fluctuation, constant torque and increasing speed mode test, constant speed and increasing torque mode test, the results showed that the fuel injection control strategies achieved the expected results and it can effectively improve the injection control. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Photomed. Laser Surg.,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different fluences of Q-switched 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser on skin repair and barrier, and clarify its mechanisms. Background data: The Q-switched 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser is widely used for rejuvenation, which needs appropriate fluence data to optimize efficacy and minimize side effects, and for elucidation of action mechanism. Materials and methods: The dorsal skin of BABL/c mice was administered 0, 1, 1.5, and 2 J/cm2energy level laser, twice a week for 4 weeks. Immediately, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after last treatment, the skin elasticity, moisture content, and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured; 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after last treatment, the hydroxyproline content, mRNA level of procollagen types I and III, protein level of keratin-10 (K-10), filaggrin, transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFβRII), Smad2, and p65 were detected. Results: Compared with the unirradiated control, the laser treatments decreased skin elasticity immediately, but increased skin moisture content in the 2 J/cm2group, and then from day 21 to day 28, the skin elasticity, moisture content, hydroxyproline content, and gene expression of types I and III procollagen increased significantly. The TEWL value of the irradiated group significantly increased after irradiation immediately and 7 days after, K-10 and filaggrin were also decreased at 7 days after. The phosphorylation of TGFβRII (p-TGFβRII) increased at days 7 and 21, and phosphorylation of Smad2 (p-Smad2) was induced at 21 days. Conclusions: Irradiation of 1064 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was able to markedly promote repair of mouse skin within 28 days through stimulation of collagen synthesis, with less skin barrier dysfunction, especially at the 1.5 J/cm2fluence, and the activation of TGFβ1-signaling pathways seemed to play an important role in repair. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",,20160701919336,,"Wang, Xue (1); Yang, Zhi (1); Xiong, Ying (1); Wan, Ping (1); He, Li (1); Chen, Yuan (1); Jiang, Song (1); Su, Hong (1); Zhang, Yi-Qiong (1); Du, Yan-Fei (1) ","(1) Department of Dermatology, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, 295 Xichang Road, Wuhua district, Kunming, Yunnan; 650032, China ",PLDHA8,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 461.9 Biology - 744.4 Solid State Lasers - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 913.5 Maintenance - 944.2 Moisture Measurements,,,,,Elasticity - Enzyme inhibition - Gene expression - Hydroxyproline - Irradiation - Mammals - Moisture - Moisture determination - Phosphorylation - Q switching - Repair - Yttrium aluminum garnet,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Zhi(kmyangzhi2015@163.com) ",10.1089/pho.2015.3921,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,15495418,2,"February 1, 2016",English,Neodymium lasers,,17.0,76-81,,2016,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,Photomedicine and Laser Surgery,,The Effects of Different Fluences of 1064 nm Q-Switched Nd:YAG Laser on Skin Repair and Skin Barrier Dysfunction in Mice,,Action mechanisms - Collagen synthesis - Hydroxyproline content - Laser treatment - Q switched Nd:YAG laser - Signaling pathways - Transepidermal water loss - Transforming growth factor beta,34
Cailiao Daobao/Mater. Rev.,"The high voltage electrical contact Cu/WCp particles reinforced composite material was prepared by powder metallurgy process. The growth behavior of fatigue crack was studied under different stress ratios. The influe-nce mechanism of stress ratio on growth rate of fatigue crack was studied by combining the crack closure model and the two parameter driving force model. Results showed that the crack growth rate increased with the increase of the stress ratio, especially in the near threshold region. The crack closure model and the two parameter driving force model could effectively relate the (da/dN-ΔK) relationship curve under different stress ratios, and the correlation of the two parameters driving force model was better. It indicated that the reason for the difference of fatigue crack growth rate under different stress ratio was the crack tip monotonic damage caused by Kmaxand the next was the degree of crack closure. Through the analysis of fracture surface morphology by SEM, the fracture could be found to be rough at high stress ratio. The fracture surface was dominated by the matrix tearing under low stress ratio and matrix particle debonding under high stress ratio. © 2016, Materials Review Magazine.

Appl Phys Lett,"A high performance ultraviolet (UV) photodetector is receiving increasing attention due to its significant applications in fire warning, environmental monitoring, scientific research, astronomical observation, etc. The enhancement in performance of the UV photodetector has been impeded by lacking of a high-efficiency heterojunction in which UV photons can efficiently convert into charges. In this work, the high performance UV photodetectors have been realized by utilizing organic/inorganic heterojunctions based on a ZnO nanoflakes/poly (N-vinylcarbazole) hybrid. A transparent conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)-coated quartz substrate is employed as the anode in replacement of the commonly ITO-coated glass in order to harvest shorter UV light. The devices show a lower dark current density, with a high responsivity (R) of 7.27 × 103A/W and a specific detectivity (D) of 6.20 × 1013cm Hz1/2/W-1at 2 V bias voltage in ambient environment (1.30 mW/cm2at λ = 365 nm), resulting in the enhancements in R and D∗ by 49% and one order of magnitude, respectively.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"The harvest time of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a very essential part for the production and quality of TCM which is the prerequisite for safe and effective clinical use of TCM. It is of great importance to carry out the research of timely harvest time of TCM. With Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to study harvest time of Seventy-two Gentiana Rigescens samples. First derivative, second derivative, standard normal variate, multiplicative scatter correction and Savitaky-Golay(15, 3) smoothing of all original spectra were pretreated with TQ8.0 software. Samples were divided into calibration set and prediction set at the ratio of 3:1. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model were established. The result indicated that after removing noise spectrum, the spectra range was from 1 800 to 600 cm-1, the method SNV combined with SD and SG present the best result of spectra pretreatment. The contribution rates of first three principal components were 92.47% with PCA. Small differences were found for the samples harvested in May, September and October. Same spectrum range was chosen and PLS-DA was applied to establish the model. The R2and RMSEE were 0.967 8, 0.086 0, respectively, and the prediction accuracy is 100%. The methods of PCA and PLS-DA have good ability to classify and identify different harvest time of Gentiana Rigescens.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"The polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) protected silver glass-like nanostructure (PVA-Ag-GNS) with high surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity was prepared and employed to detect the near-infrared surface enhanced Raman scattering (NIR-SERS) spectra of cytidine aqueous solution (10-2~10-8mol·L-1). In the work, the near-infrared laser beam (785 nm) was used as the excitation light source. The experiment results show that high-quality NIR-SERS spectra were obtained in the ranges of 300 to 2 000 cm-1and the detection limit of cytidine aqueous solution was down to 10-7mol·L-1. Meanwhile, the PVA-Ag-GNS shows a high enhancement factor (EF) of ~108. In order to test the optical reproducibility of PVA-Ag-GNS, ten samples of cytidine aqueous solution (10-2~10-5mol·L-1) had been dropped onto the surface of PVA-Ag-GNS respectively. Meanwhile, these samples were measured by the portable Raman spectrometer. As a result, the PVA-Ag-GNS demonstrated good optical reproducibility in the detection of cytidine aqueous solution. In addition, to explain the reason of enhancement effect, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) extinction spectrum and scanning electron microscope (SEM) of cytidine molecules adsorbed on the surface of PVA-Ag-GNS were measured. There is plasmon resonance band at 800 nm in the UV-Vis extinction spectrum of the compound system. Therefore, when the near-infrared laser beam (785 nm) was used as excitation light source, the compound system may produce strongly surface plasmon resonance (SPR). According to the SEM of PVA-Ag-GNS, there are much interstitial between the silver nanoparticles. So NIR-SERS is mainly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) fields associated with strong surface plasmon resonance. At last, the geometry optimization and pre-Raman spectrum of cytidine for the ground states were performed with DFT, B3LYP functional and the 6-311G basis set, and the near-infrared laser with wavelength of 785 nm was employed in the pre-Raman spectrum calculation process. The calculation results without imaginary frequency and the results match pretty well with the experimental Raman spectrum. At the same time, the assignations of Raman bands and adsorption behaviors of cytidine molecules on the surface of PVA-Ag-GNS are also discussed. According to our experiment and calculations, cytidine molecules mainly adsorbed on silver nanoparticles via the ribose moiety and amino group may get close to the local electromagnetic field. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Int. J. Reconfigurable Comput.,"As a modified-gravity proposal to handle the dark matter problem on galactic scales, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) has shown a great success. However, the N -body MOND simulation is quite challenged by its computation complexity, which appeals to acceleration of the simulation calculation. In this paper, we present a highly integrated accelerating solution for N -body MOND simulations. By using the FPGA-SoC, which integrates both FPGA and SoC (system on chip) in one chip, our solution exhibits potentials for better performance, higher integration, and lower power consumption. To handle the calculation bottleneck of potential summation, on one hand, we develop a strategy to simplify the pipeline, in which the square calculation task is conducted by the DSP48E1 of Xilinx 7 series FPGAS, so as to reduce the logic resource utilization of each pipeline; on the other hand, advantages of particle-mesh scheme are taken to overcome the bottleneck on bandwidth.

Water,"Performing a multiscale assessment of water resource vulnerability on the basis of political boundaries and watersheds is necessary for adaptive water resources management. Using the Risk-Exposure-Sensitivity-Adaptability model (RESC model), the water resource vulnerability of the Huai River Basin was assessed using four scales, namely, Class II, Class III, Province-Class II, and Municipality-Class III WRR (Water Resources Region). Following this, the spatial heterogeneity of the vulnerability of the above four scales was evaluated with the Theil and the Shannon-Weaver index. The results demonstrate that, instead of moving towards convergence, water resource vulnerability presents different grades which change together with the change in scale, and in turn, tend to weaken from east to west. Of the four scales, the scale of Municipality-Class III WRR shows the most significant spatial diversity, whereas that of Class II WRR shows the least diversity. With spatial downscaling, the vulnerability demonstrates high spatial heterogeneity and diversity. Herein, an innovative cross-scales vulnerability assessment is proposed and the RESC model characteristics and uncertainties as well as the employment of cross-scale water resource vulnerability are discussed. © 2016 by the authors.",Open Access,20164603007529,431,"Chen, Junxu (1, 2); Xia, Jun (3); Zhao, Zhifang (1); Hong, Si (3); Liu, Hong (1, 2); Zhao, Fei (1) ","(1) School of Resource, Environment and Earth Science, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) International Joint Research Center for Karstology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan; 430072, China ",,444.1 Surface Water - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,,,,,Risk management - Rivers - Watersheds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Junxu(chenjunxu07@163.com) ",10.3390/w8100431,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20734441,"Number: 2016YFC0502500/2016YFC0502502, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1502233, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51279140, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41301520, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41462015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund (No. U1502233), The National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0502500/2016YFC0502502), and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41462015, 51279140, 41301520).

The analysis and Research on the power flow of distribution network with distributed generation is an important means to analyze the influence of distributed generation on distribution network. First, Newton-Raphson algorithm is applyed to calculate the power flow of the distribution network with distributed generation. Then the optimal power flow model of the distribution network is set up based on the objective function of the minimum loss in the network. Finally, the optimization problem is solved by using the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. The simulation is tested and verified by using IEEE14 node system in the MATLAB software.

Ultrason. Sonochem.,"A major source of germanium recovery and also the source of this research is the by-product of lead and zinc metallurgical process. The primary purpose of the research is to investigate the effects of ultrasonic assisted and regular methods on the leaching yield of germanium from roasted slag containing germanium. In the study, the HCl-CaCl2 mixed solution is adopted as the reacting system and the Ca(ClO)2 used as the oxidant. Through six single factor (leaching time, temperature, amount of Ca(ClO)2, acid concentration, concentration of CaCl2 solution, ultrasonic power) experiments and the comparison of the two methods, it is found the optimum collective of germanium for ultrasonic-assisted method is obtained at temperature 80°C for a leaching duration of 40 min. The optimum concentration for hydrochloric acid, CaCl2 and oxidizing agent are identified to be 3.5 mol/L, 150 g/L and 58.33 g/L, respectively. In addition, 700 W is the best ultrasonic power and an over-high power is adverse in the leaching process. Under the optimum condition, the recovery of germanium could reach up to 92.7%. While, the optimum leaching condition for regular leaching method is same to ultrasonic-assisted method, except regular method consume 100 min and the leaching rate of Ge 88.35% is lower about 4.35%. All in all, the experiment manifests that the leaching time can be reduced by as much as 60% and the leaching rate of Ge can be increased by 3-5% with the application of ultrasonic tool, which is mainly thanks to the mechanical action of ultrasonic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Lect. Notes Electr. Eng.,"The mainstream risk decision making models, which follow the maximization rule, are based on the unbounded rationality hypothesis. However, the Equate-to-Differentiate model, which is a heuristic framework and follows the satisfaction rule, challenges these dominating models by proposing a bounded rationality approach. This study contributes to research on dual-process techniques by applying both models for explaining inference strategies that are used in individuals predicting and reasoning behaviors. To test its empirical validity, we demonstrate evidence that our model can account for real practical choices which are anomalies or paradoxes from the point of view of many other risk decision making models. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.",,20163902835728,,"Xiang, Yu (1); Bai, Lei (1); Peng, Bo (1); Ma, Li (2) ","(1) School of Information Science and Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China (2) Library of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China ",,714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 912.2 Management - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 971 Social Sciences,180939.0,"April 20, 2016 - April 22, 2016","Beijing, China","11th International Conference on Future Information Technology, FutureTech 2016",Behavioral research - Field effect transistors - Risks,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xiang, Yu(iamlionx@126.com) ",10.1007/978-981-10-1536-6_12,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),18761119,,,9789811015359.0,18761100,,2016,English,Decision making,Advanced Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering - FutureTech and MUE,15.0,85-91,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,,A dual-process technique for risk decision making by implicating equate-to-differentiate approach,,Bounded rationality - Dual process - Equate-to-differentiate - Risk decision making,393
Mater. Sci. Eng. C,"Oleanolic acid (OA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid acid of natural abundance in plants which possesses important biological activities. However, its medicinal applications were severely impeded by the poor water solubility and resultant low bioavailability and potency. In this work, studies on solid inclusion complexes of OA with a series of amino-appended β-cyclodextrins (ACDs) were conducted in order to address this issue. These complexes were prepared by suspension method and were well characterized by NMR, SEM, XRD, TG, DSC and Zeta potential measurement. The 2:1 inclusion mode of ACDs/OA complexes was elucidated by elaborate 2D NMR (ROESY). Besides, water solubility of OA was dramatically promoted by inclusion complexation with ACDs. Moreover, in vitro anticancer activities of OA against human cancer cell lines HepG2, HT29 and HCT116 were significantly enhanced after formation of inclusion complexes, while the apoptotic response results indicated their induction of apoptosis of cancer cells. This could provide a novel approach to development of novel pharmaceutical formulations of OA. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162602545206,,"Ren, Yufeng (1); Liu, Ying (2); Yang, Zhikuan (2); Niu, Raomei (1); Gao, Kai (1); Yang, Bo (1); Liao, Xiali (1); Zhang, Jihong (2, 3) ","(1) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Faculty of Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (3) Research Centre for Pharmaceutical Care and Quality Management, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650500, China ",,461.9 Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Biochemistry - Carboxylic acids - Cell culture - Cell death - Cyclodextrins - Diseases - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liao, Xiali(xlliao@yahoo.com) ",10.1016/j.msec.2016.05.022,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 201410674009, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Number: 81260501, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21362016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC , Nos. 21362016 & 81260501 ) and the Ministry of Education of P.R.

Rock Soil Mech,"Engineering surrounding rock is a highly nonlinear complex dynamic system, and its influence factors are so numerous that single evaluation index can accurately not describe the surrounding rock classification. At present,there are many methods to evaluate surrounding rock classification via considering various indicators together. However,the correlations exist in these evaluation indexes more or less. That is to say,these evaluation indexes are indicators of non-Gaussian distribution; so it is difficult to meet the request that sample layers of probabilistic neural network(PNN) must adopt Gaussian distribution as radial basis function. Given this,we presented a symmetric stable distribution (SaS) which not only has a wider range of mathematical expression than the Gauss distribution,but also it could act as the radial basis function of sample beds in probabilistic neural network (PNN). The model of the surrounding rock classification evaluation in the second-stage project of Guangzhou pumped storage power station can be established based on the SaS distribution. The predicted results show that the model has a good effect and its false-positive rate is 4.55%. This model can provide a new way for predicting the effect of surrounding rock classification in underground engineering. © 2016, Science Press.

RSC Adv.,"The aim of this paper is to develop easily manufactured and highly sensitive gas sensors for VOCs (volatile organic compounds) detection. Macro-/mesoporous 5 at% Al-doped ZnO (AZO) and Ag-AZO composite powders were prepared by a one-step solution combustion method and used to fabricate gas sensors. Both powders showed the same macro-/mesoporous morphology but have different grain sizes and separated silver phase due to the fast growth of ZnO and the reduction of Ag+. The capability of Ag-AZO was investigated for VOCs detection, including n-butanol, methanol, acetone, ethanol, isopropanol and formaldehyde. It is found that the added Ag greatly increases the gas response towards different VOCs. Particularly 2.5 at% Ag-AZO shows the most superior gas sensing performance to 100 ppm VOCs at an operating temperature of 240 °C, which is also the optimum operating temperature of other sensors. The results may be attributed to the synergistic effects of these doped and composite elements, the amount of adsorbed oxygen and the macro-/mesoporous morphology. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,20164502981727,,"Xing, Xinxin (1); Li, Yuxiu (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Chen, Nan (2); Liu, Xu (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 3); Wang, Yude (2, 3) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,641.1 Thermodynamics - 723.1 Computer Programming - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth,,,,,Acetone - Aluminum compounds - Chemical detection - Chemical sensors - Combustion - Gas detectors - Gases - Grain growth - II-VI semiconductors - Macros - Powders - Temperature - Volatile organic compounds - Zinc oxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6ra23780k,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51262029).,,,103,2016,English,Silver compounds,,58.0,101304-101312,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Ag-Functionalized macro-/mesoporous AZO synthesized by solution combustion for VOCs gas sensing application,,Composite element - Composite powders - Gas sensing applications - Macro/mesoporous - Operating temperature - Solution combustion - Solution combustion method - Synergistic effect,6

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"Crop potential productivity (PP) refers to the highest yield of fine crop variety per unit area that might be obtained assuming all or part of the factors are in the optimum state. Thermal potential production (TPP) refers to the highest yield of ideal crop colony in the condition of local sunlight and temperature assuming that the agricultural production condition has been fully guaranteed in adequate supply of water, CO2and suitable states of other environmental factors, while climatic potential production (CPP) refers to the theoretical yield of crops taking precipitation effect into further consideration based on TPP. The 'Regulation for Gradation on Agriculture Land Quality' GB/T 28407-2012 (Regulation) provides the crops' TPP and CPP nationwide according to the reports of sowing/harvest date from all provinces, and the meteorological data of 2231 stations from the National Meteorological Administration within 30 years (1961-1990). Each county just provides one set of TPP and CPP data for appointment crop according to the meteorological data from only one station in the county, and the PP value of crop only represents the local conditions. Yunnan Province is the most prominent and representative region of stereo climate in China. There are 1669 dams with the area of larger than 1 km2across Yunnan Province, totally covering the area of 245.35 hm2. Each county has many combined configurations of 'dam-hill-mountain' with larger differences in TPP and CPP. In the first-round grading work on agricultural land quality in Yunnan Province, most of the counties use the TPP and CPP from meteorological stations representing the value of TPP and CPP of the whole county to calculate the agricultural land quality grade index, which must be very different from the actual situations. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to make altitude correction of TPP and CPP in order to ensure the objectivity and veracity of classification results in Yunnan Province. This paper is aimed to obtain the PP value of appointment crops outside the regions with meteorological stations by making altitude correction on TPP and CPP of appointment crops from county meteorological stations in plateau basin regions of Yunnan according to the 'Regulation', and to investigate its influence on agricultural land physical quality grade. This paper made an altitude correction model on the TPP and CPP of one-season rice, summer maize and winter wheat according to the TPP and CPP data of appointment crops from 56 county meteorological stations in plateau basin regions where Luliang County locates. Then a paddy land and a dry land of high quality were respectively chosen in each village to verify the rationality of the model according to per unit area yield of actual crops in paddy land and dry land. The differences of agricultural land physical quality grade before and after altitude correction of TPP and CPP in Luliang County were testified. The results showed that the actual crop yield per unit area for one-season rice, summer maize and winter wheat was all less than the value of TPP and CPP before and after altitude correction, and had the same change tendency of the TPP and CPP after altitude correction with the altitude change, and the TPP and CPP after altitude correction of one-season rice, summer maize and winter wheat much more conformed to actual situations than that before. The reduction range of agricultural land physical quality grade after altitude correction was between [-0.8,1.7], 99.76% of which was within 1.5 in Luliang. There is only one meteorological station in each county actually, and most are located in dams, while just few in mountains. The PP could not be calculated based on the meteorological data because lacking the meteorological stations for regions around. Most counties obtained the crops' PP value by using altitude correction in the regions outside meteorological stations in Yunnan. The TPP and CPP after altitude correction were chosen to evaluate the agricultural land physical quality grade if the altitude of the majority of agricultural land in the county was higher than that of the meteorological station, which was a little lower than that before. The regulation model of crop PP changing with altitude is the key to altitude correction, which is directly influenced by choosing standard spot. It is different to build up an altitude correction model for whole province conforming to the actual situation by taking the crops' PP of county meteorological stations as standard spot for certain appointment crops, because the meteorological stations have limited amount and uneven distribution in Yunnan Province. The further research direction is to build up altitude correction model and program in partitions, and to perform the connections in partitions. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

"IEEE CITS - Int. Conf. Comput., Inf. Telecommun. Syst.","Mining spatial co-location pattern is one of the most important researches in the field of spatial data mining. In the past researches, many spatial co-location pattern mining algorithms and the expansions about these algorithms have been proposed. However, some of these methods often produce a large number of patterns which are difficult to use. If we want to use the subset of the prevalent co-location pattern set to summarize the whole set and as the increase of the number of patterns in subset, the patterns in subset always are the best summary for the original prevalent set. This is a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we consider the problem of ordering a prevalent co-location pattern set so that each prefix of the ordering gives as good a summary of the set as possible. And according to the features of spatial data, we define an estimation of participation index function and a prevalent co-location pattern loss function to formulate this problem and design a greedy algorithm which gives an approximation quality. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163802815483,7546423,"Yuan, Gongsheng (1); Wang, Lizhen (1); Yang, Peizhong (1); Chen, Lan (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics",123384.0,"July 6, 2016 - July 8, 2016","Kunming, China","2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, CITS 2016",Approximation algorithms - Computational complexity - Data mining,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Lizhen(lzhwang@ynu.edu.com) ",10.1109/CITS.2016.7546423,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by grants (No. 61472346, No.61262069) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and in part by a grant (No. 2015FB149, No.2015FB114) from the Science Foundation of Yunnan Province.",9781509034406.0,,,"August 16, 2016",English,Location,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",8.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks (ISN); Xidian University; Yunnan Minzu University,Spatial co-location pattern ordering,,Approximation quality - Co-location patterns - Co-locations - Greedy algorithms - ordering - Participation index - Spatial co-location patterns - Spatial data mining,

Tien Tzu Hsueh Pao,"A heuristic intelligent path planning method based on the multivariant optimization algorithm and the Bezier curve is presented. The path planning problem is transformed into an optimization problem through using the Bezier curve to represent a path in this method. Then, the multivariant optimization algorithm is applied to find the optimal control points of the best Bezier curve, aiming at finding the optimal path. The multivariant optimization algorithm searches the solution space through iterations of alternative global and local search. According to the different responsibilities, the search individuals (atoms) could be divided into two types: the global atoms and the local atoms. In each iteration, global atoms explore the whole solution space to local potential areas, and then, local atoms exploit each potential area. Obviously, atoms are characterized by multivariant responsibilities, hence the name of the multivariant optimization algorithm. The good performance of the multivariant optimization algorithm is ensured by the efficient communication and cooperation of multivariant atoms. To evaluate the performance of the multivariant optimization algorithm, comparative experiments against the other three classical heuristic path planning algorithms are carried out based on a standard testing map. The results show that our proposed method is superior to the other methods in optimality, stability and efficiency. © 2016, Chinese Institute of Electronics.

The structures of oxaliplatin/CDs were confirmed by NMR, FTIR, TGA, XRD as well as SEM analysis. The results show that the water solubility of oxaliplatin was increased in the complex with CDs in 1:1 stoichiometry inclusion modes, and the cyclohexane ring of oxaliplatin molecule was deeply inserted into the cavity of CDs. Moreover, the stoichiometry was established by a Job plot and the water stability constant (Kc) of oxaliplatin/CDs was calculated by phase solubility studies, all results show that the oxaliplatin/β-CD complex is more stable than free oxaliplatin, oxaliplatin/HP-β-CD and oxaliplatin/γ-CD. Meanwhile, the inclusion complexes displayed almost twice as high cytotoxicity compared to free oxaliplatin against HCT116 and MCF-7 cells.

In terms of optical loss through gaps of CPCs and optical efficiency averaged for radiation over the acceptance angle, CPC-6, designed based on a fictitious 'hat'-shaped absorber with a 'V' groove at the bottom, is the optimal design, and CPC-1, designed based on the cover tube, is the worst solution, whereas from the point of view of the annual collectible radiation on the EST, it is found that CPC-4, designed based on a fictitious 'ice-cream' absorber, is the optimal design and CPC-1 is the worst solution. CPC-6, commonly regarded as the best design in the past, is not an optimal design in terms of annual collectible radiation after truncation. Results also indicate that, for high temperature applications, CPC-6 and CPC-4 are advisable due to the high solar flux on the EST resulting from the high optical efficiency for radiation within the acceptance angle. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",Open Access,20172503806124,795,"Wang, Qiang (1); Wang, Jinfu (1); Tang, Runsheng (1) ","(1) Education Ministry Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology and Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 812.3 Glass - 913.1 Production Engineering - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Efficiency - Glass - High temperature applications - Optimal systems - Ray tracing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Runsheng(kingtang01@126.com) ",10.3390/en9100795,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19961073,"Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is partial fulfillment of the funded research program No.51466016, financially supported by Natural Science Foundation of China.",,,10,October 2016,English,Solar concentrators,,24.0,,,2016,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Energies,,Design and optical performance of compound parabolic solar concentrators with evacuated tube as receivers,,Acceptance angle - All-glass evacuated solar tube (EST) - Comparative studies - Compound parabolic solar concentrator (CPC) - Optical efficiency - Optical performance - Optimal design - Ray tracing simulation,9

Due to a lack of adequate characterization of single similarity measure, we employ a combined similarity clustering analysis method in this paper, i.e., make use of the combined similarity to summarize the relationship between various ethnic factors and environmental design, which greatly improves the reliability and comprehensiveness of similarity measure and, can be applying in making reasonable classification of the hybrid multi index information. This method, which is intuitive, easy to operate, and convenient for application, not only can be used in the study on environmental art design of ethnic elements, but also lays a foundation for further analysis of related issues. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171203460219,7825163,"Yang, Chunsuo (1) ","(1) College F Design, Yunnan Arts University, Kunming Yunnan; 650000, China ",,903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 961 Systems Science,126073.0,"November 25, 2016 - November 26, 2016","Zhangjiajie, Hunan, China","2016 International Conference on Smart City and Systems Engineering, ICSCSE 2016",Classification (of information) - Iterative methods - Reliability analysis - Smart city - Systems engineering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Chunsuo ",10.1109/ICSCSE.2016.0150,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509055302.0,,,"January 18, 2017",English,Clustering algorithms,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Smart City and Systems Engineering, ICSCSE 2016",7.0,553-557,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Smart City and Systems Engineering, ICSCSE 2016",Central South University; Changsha University of Science and Technology; Communications Research Institute of Changsha University of Science and Technology; Hunan City University; Research Institute of New Energy and Energy-Saving and Emission Reduction; Research Institute of Road and Bridge of Guangdong Academy of Building Research,Environmental Art Design Method Based on Multiple Ethnic Elements,,Attribute information - Clustering analysis - Multi-index - Natural languages - Numerical information - Optimal clustering - Optimal partitions - Similarity measure,
"Sens Actuators, B Chem","As a new methanol sensing material, the composite of palladium-platinum-In2O3composited nanocrystalline SnO2was successfully obtained by a solid-phase reaction method. The phase composition and the unique structure of as-prepared SnO2-Pd-Pt-In2O3composite were comprehensively characterized using the techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The results of gas sensing properties indicate that the sensor based on the as-prepared SnO2-Pd-Pt-In2O3composite shows the ultra-high response to methanol at an optimal operating temperature of 160 °C when the mass ratio of SnO2, Pd, Pt and In2O3is 100:0.8:2:30. The gas response toward 100 ppm of methanol reaches as high as 320.73. The detection limit of the sensor is estimated to be 0.1 ppm. The sensor also exhibited good response-recovery properties, selectivity, remarkable repeatability and stability, suggesting its greatly promising application in gas sensing. This work could stimulate an effective means to fabricate methanol sensor with superior performance. At the same time, a possible sensing mechanism of the SnO2-Pd-Pt-In2O3composite is discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162702559865,,"Li, Yuxiu (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Xing, Xinxin (1); Chen, Nan (2); Liu, Xu (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 3); Wang, Yude (2, 3) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",SABCEB,547.1 Precious Metals - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Chemical detection - Chemical sensors - Convergence of numerical methods - Gas detectors - Gases - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Methanol - Nanocrystalline materials - Nanocrystals - Palladium - Palladium compounds - Platinum - Scanning electron microscopy - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray powder diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.snb.2016.06.088,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51262029 ) and the Program for Excellent Young Talents , Yunnan University.",,09254005,,"December 1, 2016",English,Indium compounds,,52.0,133-141,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,"Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical",,A high performance methanol gas sensor based on palladium-platinum-In2O3composited nanocrystalline SnO2,,Gas response - Gas sensing properties - Operating temperature - Palladium-platinum - Recovery properties - Sensing mechanism - SnO2 - Solid phase reaction,237
Commun Stat Theory Methods,"ABSTRACT: In this article, a finite mixture model of hurdle Poisson distribution with missing outcomes is proposed, and a stochastic EM algorithm is developed for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and mixing proportions. Specifically, missing data is assumed to be missing not at random (MNAR)/non ignorable missing (NINR) and the corresponding missingness mechanism is modeled through probit regression. To improve the algorithm efficiency, a stochastic step is incorporated into the E-step based on data augmentation, whereas the M-step is solved by the method of conditional maximization. A variation on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is also proposed to compare models with different number of components with missing values. The considered model is a general model framework and it captures the important characteristics of count data analysis such as zero inflation/deflation, heterogeneity as well as missingness, providing us with more insight into the data feature and allowing for dispersion to be investigated more fully and correctly. Since the stochastic step only involves simulating samples from some standard distributions, the computational burden is alleviated. Once missing responses and latent variables are imputed to replace the conditional expectation, our approach works as part of a multiple imputation procedure. A simulation study and a real example illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our methodology. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,20163102661604,,"Fu, Ying-Zi (1) ","(1) Faculty of Science, Kunming Science and Technology University, Yunnan, China ",CSTMDC,903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 922 Statistical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Abstracting - Barium compounds - Maximum likelihood estimation - Mixtures - Poisson distribution - Stochastic systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fu, Ying-Zi(fuyz1980@gmail.com) ",10.1080/03610926.2014.953689,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1532415X,,,,03610926,20,"October 17, 2016",English,Stochastic models,,19.0,5918-5932,,2016,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods,,Stochastic EM algorithm of a finite mixture model from hurdle Poisson distribution with missing responses,,Bayesian information criterion - Conditional expectation - Finite mixture modeling - Maximum likelihood estimate - Missing data - Model Selection - Standard distributions - Stochastic em,45

Colloids Surf. B Biointerfaces,"Sorption and desorption of phosphate (P) on Fe and Al (hydr)oxides may be affected by bacteria in soils because their ubiquitous and strong interactions. The role of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens in adsorption of P on gibbsite (γ-AlOOH) was systematically investigated under a wide range of conditions by combining in-situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with batch macroscopic experiments. In-situ ATR-FTIR observations of the ternary systems (bacteria, P, and gibbsite) showed simultaneous desorption of P from, and adhesion of the bacteria to, gibbsite, indicating a competition between the two for surface sites. Batch desorption experiments showed that bacteria could mobilize the P from gibbsite into solution, and macroscopic adsorption data showed that the amount of P adsorbed on the bacteria–gibbsite complex was less than that on gibbsite alone over durations from 0 h to 26 h, concentrations of P from 0.1 mM to 2.0 mM, pH from 5 to 8, and ionic strength from 0 M to 0.5 M, suggesting that bacteria inhibit the adsorption of P on gibbsite. The degree of inhibition increased with the number of bacteria in the system and was significantly but non-linearly correlated with the decline in the positive charge on gibbsite induced by the bacteria. Therefore, competition for suitable sites on the surface of gibbsite between P and the bacteria and reduction in the positive charge on the surface of gibbsite induced by bacteria are proposed as two important mechanisms that inhibit P adsorption. These findings highlight the role of bacteria in regulating the availability of P to plants and its mobility in natural environments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20163902855941,,"Hong, Zhi-neng (1); Li, Jiu-yu (1); Jiang, Jun (1); Li, Zhao-li (2); Xu, Ren-kou (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing; 210008, China (2) College of Resources and Environment, Yunnan Agricultural University, Yunnan; 650201, China ",CSBBEQ,483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Adsorption - Aluminum compounds - Bacteriology - Desorption - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Ionic strength - Soil pollution - Supersaturation - Zeta potential,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Ren-kou(rkxu@issas.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.09.026,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734367,"Number: BK20131048, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: 41301239, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41230855, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This present work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant Nos. 41301239 and 41230855 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu province , China (grant No. BK20131048 ).

Then stacked denoising auto-encoder is introduced to extract features from pulse signal under the work mode level unsupervised. Finally the parameters of the network are optimized by the back propagation algorithm in order to recognize airborne phased array radar under different modes.

The absorption bands of the original spectrum were very similar, which were composed by protein and polysaccharides, but tiny differences were observed at the position, shape and absorption intensities of peaks. Second derivative infrared spectroscopy technology was applied to study 6 species of the samples, there were obvious differences in the range of 1 800~1 400 and 1 200~800 cm-1. Two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy can improve the resolution of spectra. Therefore two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy was used to study 6 kinds of mushrooms. The results showed that there are three auto-peaks in the Lactarius, four in the Russula and significant differences in the number, intensity of auto-peaks and cross peaks were observed in the range of 1 690~1 420 cm-1. In addition, the peaks quantity, position, intensity of auto-peaks and cross peaks were different in the range of 1 110~920 cm-1.

Huagong Xuebao,"Based on particle image velocity (PIV) technology and particle diffusion law, the diffusion coefficient of SAPO-34 catalyst particles in turbulent fluidized bed for methanol to olefins (MTO) was studied. A two dimensional transparent glass fluidized bed reactor was used to study the particle diffusion coefficient as functions of operating gas velocity and particle size. The motion of SAPO-34 particles was recorded by high speed camera, based on which both longitudinal and lateral velocities were calculated via image processing technology, hence the diffusion coefficient was obtained according to particle diffusion law. It showed that both longitudinal and lateral diffusion coefficient of SAPO-34 particles (Geldart A) increased with operating gas velocity. The longitudinal diffusion coefficient ranged from 10-3m2·s-1to 10-2m2·s-1, and the lateral diffusion coefficient from 10-1m2·s-1to 10-2m2·s-1. In addition, under the same fluidization operating gas velocity, the particles with smaller particle size possessed larger diffusion coefficient than those with larger one.

Jingxi Huagong,"Catalytic properties of Ni/SBA-15 catalysts that prepared by different nickel precursors were studied for methane dry reforming. Catalyst prepared by nickel acetate exhibited the best catalytic activity among the samples and the excellent stability and selectivity were obtained at 700 for 20 h. The structure, surface species and redox properties of the catalysts were investigated by N2adsorption-desorption, XRD, H2-TPR, XPS and TG techniques. The results indicated that the superior catalytic activity was ascribed to a lower crystallinity and the excellent redox ability.

Huagong Jinzhan/Chem. Ind. Eng. Prog.,"Asymmetric hydrogenation has the advantage of cleanliness, perfect atom economy, and is one of the hottest methods of asymmetric synthesis. The asymmetric hydrogenation in C=C, C=O, C=N are still primarily dependent on the use of transition metal catalysts. The study of transition metal catalysts, especially the asymmetric hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bond catalyzed by rhodium catalysts is still an evolving field. In the present review, the progress on asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins catalyzed by rhodium catalysts are described, including the catalytic mechanism of rhodium-diphosphine ligand catalyst system, the application of asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines, unsaturated carboxylic acids and their derivatives, enol ester as well as unfunctionalized olefins catalyzed by rhodium catalysts. The development trend of rhodium catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins was pointed out. For instance:(1) the catalytic mechanism of asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins by rhodium-monophosphine ligand needs to be understood; (2) more chiral ligands for asymmetric hydrogenation of unfunctionalized olefins are still wanted. © 2016, Chemical Industry Press.

Sol Energ Mater Sol Cells,"Polyurethane polymers were directly synthesized via bulk polymerization as novel solid-solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) for thermal energy storage. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) with 4000 and 6000 g/mol number average molecular weight were used as phase change functional chain, castor oil as the skeleton, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) were individually served as coupling reagent. The molecular structure, crystalline properties, phase change performances, thermal reliability and stability of the synthesized SSPCMs were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry analysis (TG), respectively. The XRD patterns and POM images showed that the synthesized SSPCMs have the same crystalline structure and confined crystallization compared with pristine PEG. The DSC results indicated that the synthesized SSPCMs have high latent heats and a suitable phase change temperature range, and the maximum latent heats in melting and freezing process for the SSPCMs are 117.70 J/g and 109.00 J/g, respectively.

In this paper, we study robust partially functional linear regression model in which a scale response variable is explained by a function-valued variable and a finite number of real-valued variables. For the estimation of the regression parameters, which include the infinite dimensional function as well as the slope parameters for the real-valued variables, we use polynomial splines to approximate the slop parameter. The estimation procedure is easy to implement, and it is resistant to heavy-tailederrors or outliers in the response. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established.

Geotecton. Metallog.,"The Beiya poly-metallic gold deposit is one of the typical Cenozoic porphyry-type deposits in the Sanjiang poly-metallic metallogenetic belt, northwestern Yunnan. In recent years, an important breakthrough has been achieved in the Beiya poly-metallic gold deposit prospecting, which made the Au reserves rank the super-large-scale class. Through precise measurement of the large scale structural sections, we identified the mechanical properties of typical rock- and ore-controlling structures and analyzed the mechanism of the structural control of porphyry emplacement and ore-formation. The main constructional compressive stress in the Beiya orefield transited from near EW-trending to near SN-trending and to near EW-trending, forming the typical folds-faults-joints rock- and ore-controlling structures system since Late Yanshanian. The basic folding structural framework formed under near EW-trending principal compressive stress during Late Yanshanian to Early Himalayan period provided favorable structural environment for the emplacement of the porphyries. The principal compressive stress turned to near SN-trending in Middle Himalayan, which was accompanied by the ultra-shallow intrusion of the quartz syenite porphyry and porphyry-type poly-metallic gold mineralization. The ore-bodies occurred in the interlayered faulted fracture zones, faults and joints which were distributed in belts type, veins type and layers type, and porphyry-type disseminated ore-bodies were formed in the porphyry, some skarn-type gold-rich ore-bodies were formed in the contact zones of porphyry and surrounding rock. The ore bodies are hosted in the interlayered faulted fracture zones, faults, and joints, occurring as banded, vein-type, and strata-form ores. Disseminated ores are located inside of the porphyry while the skarn-type ores are found in the contacts. During Late Himalayan, the nearly EW-trending compression resulted in the destruction of ore-bodies and porphyry, and to the subsequent uplift and denudation. The oxidizing-leaching-type ore-bodies were formed mainly in this period. © 2016, Science Press.

"IEEE CITS - Int. Conf. Comput., Inf. Telecommun. Syst.","By general exploration there is one or more geologic abnormal areas within Fumei No. 1 Coalmine Industrial Square and Shaft, which will affect the mine shaft construction and safety production. However, traditional methods for hidden disaster-causing factors will not meet the exploration demands because of their defects. For example, direct current electric method, geological radar and even three-dimensional seismic prospecting can not simultaneously identify geologic abnormal areas of water-bearing condition both underground and in mid-deep zone. Therefore, to explore hidden disaster-causing factors more fully, this paper puts forward a signal acquisition and processing way based on transient electromagnetic method. On the principle of transient electromagnetic method, a system of transient electromagnetic signal acquisition is built and composed of transmitter unit and receiver unit. By triggering start button, the system wirelessly triggers transmitter unit, i.e. one pulse magnetic field to the underground each time. 4ms later, two receiver coils simultaneously collect signals of the secondary pulsed magnetic field caused by underground medium. Finally the signal data are stored in CF card after RC filtering, operational amplifying, sample integral and analog-to-digital conversion. From the signal data processing and analyzing results, there are hidden disaster-causing factors in the exploration zone: one collapse column, one coalmine goaf and one underground watercourse. Compared with the geological data of pilot holes of shaft, these three geologic abnormal places are confirmed, which powerfully helps prove the reliability and efficiency of this method of signal acquisition and processing. These relevant exploration data can not only provide geologic basis for construction of industrial square buildings and structures, but also supply design and construction of shafts with instructions, and furthermore, serve as data reference for exploration of hidden disaster-causing factors in more complicated geological conditions areas. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163802815455,7546395,"Sun, Bin (1); Li, Haiying (2) ","(1) Capital Construction Department, SDIC Qujing Coal Development Co., Ltd, Qujing, China (2) School of Foreign Languages, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",,481.1 Geology - 481.4 Geophysical Prospecting - 503.1 Coal Mines - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 713.1 Amplifiers - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,123384.0,"July 6, 2016 - July 8, 2016","Kunming, China","2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, CITS 2016",Accident prevention - Analog to digital conversion - Coal mines - Data handling - Digital to analog conversion - Disasters - Geology - Magnetic fields - Mine shafts - Operational amplifiers - Seismic prospecting - Signal receivers - Transient analysis - Transmitters,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Sun, Bin(ynkmben@163.com) ",10.1109/CITS.2016.7546395,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509034406.0,,,"August 16, 2016",English,Signal processing,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",7.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks (ISN); Xidian University; Yunnan Minzu University,A study on transient electromagnetic signal acquisition and processing for exploring hidden disaster-causing factors in coalmine,,Complicated geological conditions - Design and construction - hidden disaster-causing factors - Pulse magnetic field - Pulsed magnetic fields - Signal acquisitions - Transient electromagnetic methods - Transient electromagnetics,
J Anal At Spectrom,"Generation of volatile hydrides and elemental mercury was accomplished in non-aqueous media by using a solid reductant of lithium aluminium tetrahydride (LiAlH4), stannous chloride dehydrate (SnCl2) or tetrahydroborate (THB) as a derivation reagent. A room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) was used as the non-aqueous media for the chemical vapor generation (CVG), and atomic fluorescence spectrometry was used for the elemental determination. The analyte ions were firstly extracted into the RTIL media from the bulk aqueous phase of the analyte/sample solution via a liquid-liquid extraction process and then directly mixed with the solid reductant to generate volatile analyte-containing species, which were then rapidly transported to a commercial atomic fluorescence spectrometer for detection. Hg(ii), As(iii) and Sb(iii) were selected as the model analytes for evaluating this new CVG technique. The three reductants could all reduce Hg(ii) to the elemental state, but only THB could generate volatile species of As(iii) and Sb(iii). Compared to conventional CVG in the aqueous phase, the efficiencies of CVG accomplished with solid reductants were similar or even better, there was less interference from transition and noble metal ions, and much better limits of detection were obtained.

J. Inf. Sci. Eng.,"Kernel logs are very important source of information for administrators to reconstruct security events. Once a sophisticated attacker intrudes a computer system, he (or she) may manipulate the kernel log to clear up the intrusion evidence. Previous solutions suffer from limitations in that: 1) Some methods do not provide adequate protection; 2) Some methods are not compatible with the existing systems or hardware; 3) Some methods incur considerable performance overhead. In this paper, we present SEKEL, a secure and efficient kernel log transfer mechanism based on virtualization technology. The basic idea of our approach is to decouple the kernel log collection and transfer procedures into two concurrent components. On one hand, the log collection component protected by the SIM framework is deployed in the target VM. On the other hand, the log transfer component is placed into a trusted execution environment for performance isolation. To deal with the synchronization problem introduced by our concurrent components, we extend Lamport's ring buffer algorithm. The evaluation shows that SEKEL can protect kernel logs effectively with little performance degradation. © 2016, Institute of Information Science.

Dianli Xitong Zidonghue,"Proper network partition for secondary voltage control is the prerequisite for the application of three levels or “soft” three levels voltage control. Good partition should satisfy the conditions that each partition contains at least one reactive power source while maintaining connexity itself. This paper proposes a three-stage network partition method for secondary voltage control based on network structure and electrical distance. Firstly, the method proposed merges the reactive power source nodes connected by radial branches into one and the same partition according to the network structure. Secondly, the controlled nodes are classified into two types, and then merged into the partition to which the nearest reactive power source in electrical distance belongs while keeping the connexity of partitions. Finally, an agglomerative analysis is made on the initial partitions according to WARD distance to determine the final network partitions. Allowing for merger to be performed only between the connected partitions guarantees the connexity of the final partition while greatly reducing the scale of agglomerative computation. The method proposed meets the demand of secondary voltage control as the partition results are related only to the network structure while having nothing to do with the operation conditions, such as power flow distributions. The partition results of an IEEE 39-bus system and Yunnan power system have verified the rationality and efficiency of the proposed method, showing that the method is of definite application value to the secondary voltage control of power systems. © 2016 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.",,20161402199897,,"Bao, Wei (1); Zhu, Tao (2); Zhao, Chuan (2); Wu, Tao (3); Guo, Ruipeng (1) ","(1) College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (2) Yunnan Power Dispatching and Control Center, Kunming; 650011, China (3) Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Jibei Electric Power Co.

Int Conf Signal Process Proc,"On the basis of the original SIFT algorithm, this paper presents an improved point matching algorithm for brain CT image, which combines the SIFT and gray feature. Firstly, the SIFT algorithm is used to extract the key points of the images, and for each key points, a 128 dimensional SIFT feature vector is generated. The Euclidean distance of the SIFT feature vector is used as the similarity measure to obtain the initial matching point-pairs. Then, the gray method is used to extract the gray feature for each key point in initial matching point-pairs. Both the Euclidean distance and cosine similarity of gray feature vectors are used as the similarity measure to obtain the final matching point-pairs. This algorithm makes full use of the principle of rotation invariance and the gray level difference of key points to match. Experimental results show that this method improve the accuracy from 89.83% to 92.78% with the time complexity basically unchanged, at the same time, the number of correct matches are not much reduced. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171403516520,7877785,"Xiao, Zhe (1); Yu, Linfang (1); Qin, Zhen (1); Ren, Huaigui (1); Geng, Zhenwei (2) ","(1) University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China (2) Yunnan Powergrid Co.

Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.,"All-weather solar cells are promising in solving the energy crisis. A flexible solar cell is presented that is triggered by combining an electron-enriched graphene electrode with a dye-sensitized solar cell. The new solar cell can be excited by incident light on sunny days and raindrops on rainy days, yielding an optimal solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of 6.53 % under AM 1.5 irradiation and current over microamps as well as a voltage of hundreds of microvolts by simulated raindrops. The formation of π-electron|cation electrical double-layer pseudocapacitors at graphene/raindrop interface is contributable to current and voltage outputs at switchable charging-discharging process. The new concept can guide the design of advanced all-weather solar cells. A flexible solar cell that can be excited by sunlight and raindrops is presented. The solar-to-electric conversion efficiency is created by complicated photoelectrochemical reactions, while electric signals, produced by dropping raindrops on rGO film, arise from π-electron|cation pseudocapacitance at the rGO/raindrop interface.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW","Human hand pose recovery (HPR) in depth images is usually conducted by constructing mappings between 2D depth images and 3D hand poses. It is a challenging task since the feature spaces of 2D images and 3D poses are different. Therefore, a large number of labeled data is required for training, especially for popular frameworks such as deep learning. In this paper, we propose an HPR method with weak supervision. It is based on neural network and domain adaptation is introduced to enhance the trained model. To achieve domain adaptation, we propose low-rank alignment, which aligns the testing samples to the distribution of labeled samples. In this process, autoencoders are used to extract 2D image features and low-rank representation is used to describe this feature space. Therefore, the proposed method is named as Domain Adaptation with Low-Rank Alignment (DALA). In this way, we obtain a robust and non-linear mapping from 2D images to 3D poses. Experiments are conducted on two challenging benchmark datasets MSRA and ICVL. Both the results on a single dataset and across datasets show the outstanding performance of DALA. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171203457730,7836701,"Hong, Chaoqun (2); Yu, Jun (3); Xie, Rongsheng (1); Tao, Dapeng (1) ","(1) Key Lab of IOT Fujian Province University, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, China (2) School of Computer Science, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou; 310018, China (3) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, China ",,405.3 Surveying - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing,126380.0,"December 12, 2016 - December 15, 2016","Barcelona, Spain","16th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2016",Computer system recovery - Data mining - Deep learning - Mapping - Neural networks - Recovery,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICDMW.2016.0070,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),23759259,,,9781509054725.0,23759232,,"July 2, 2016",English,Image processing,"Proceedings - 16th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2016",40.0,446-453,1 of 1,2016,IEEE Computer Society,"IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW",IEEE Computer Society,Weakly Supervised Hand Pose Recovery with Domain Adaptation by Low-Rank Alignment,,Autoencoders - Benchmark datasets - Domain adaptation - Feature space - Human hands - Low-rank representations - Nonlinear mappings - Testing samples,0

IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens,"Microwave remote sensing has been largely applied to retrieve soil moisture (SM) from active and passive sensors. The obvious advantage of microwave sensors is that SM can be obtained regardless of atmospheric conditions. However, existing global SM products only provide observations at coarse spatial resolutions, which often hamper their application in regional hydrological studies. On the other hand, the vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) has been widely used to monitor the SM status. It is based on high-spatial-resolution visible and infrared satellite observations. The aim of this study is to develop a simple and efficient downscaling approach for estimating accurate SM at higher spatial resolution. The VTCI calculated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer is used to downscale the coarse-resolution SM product that has been developed under the framework of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) projects. The original and downscaled SM estimates are further validated against the in situ SM observations collected in the Yunnan province (southwest China). It is found that the accuracy level of CCI SM is similar to the results from previously published validation studies. The downscaled SM can maintain the accuracy of CCI SM and, at the same time, present more spatial details, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method. Overall, the notable advantages of the proposed method are simplicity, limited data requirements and purely relying on satellite measurements, and comparable accuracy level to other complex downscaling schemes. It will facilitate local hydrological applications, particularly in data-scarce regions, where the above-listed characteristics are important and useful. © 2015 IEEE.",,20153501212724,7214286,"Peng, Jian (1); Loew, Alexander (1, 2); Zhang, Shiqiang (3); Wang, Jie (4); Niesel, Jonathan (1) ","(1) Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg; 20146, Germany (2) Department of Geography, University of Munich (LMU), Munich; 80333, Germany (3) College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an; 710027, China (4) Yunnan Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, Kunming; 650228, China ",IGRSD2,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 655.2 Satellites - 732.2 Control Instrumentation - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 944.7 Radiation Measuring Instruments,,,,,Climate change - Image resolution - Microwave sensors - Radiometers - Remote sensing - Satellite imagery - Spectrometers - Vegetation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TGRS.2015.2462074,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,01962892,1,"January 1, 2016",English,Soil moisture,,65.0,558-566,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,,Spatial Downscaling of Satellite Soil Moisture Data Using a Vegetation Temperature Condition Index,,Climate variables - Disaggregation - Down-scaling - Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer - Spatial resolution - Vegetation temperature condition index,54
Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"In view of low rendering performance of complex data set which is caused by the limited memory bandwidth and data access speed, this paper presents a mesh layout algorithm based on greedy optimization strategy, by rearranging triangle sequences to improve spatial and temporal locality. Firstly, according to the improved cost function, we choose the vertex with the minimum cost as the focus vertex. Then render its all adjacent unrendered triangles by pushing their bounding vertices into buffer. The above steps are executed iteratively until adjacent triangles of all vertices are rendered. Finally, we get the reordered triangle sequence. Experimental results show that the algorithm provides a higher vertex cache hit ratio with less running time, which can effectively solve the problem of data access speed lagging behind the processing speed of GPU seriously. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20162702570285,,"Lou, Ziting (1); Zhang, Yaping (1) ","(1) College of Computer Science and Information Techniques, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming City; Yunnan Province; 650500, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics,176359.0,"April 14, 2016 - April 16, 2016","Hangzhou, China","10th International Conference on E-Learning and Games, Edutainment 2016",Cost functions - E-learning - Iterative methods - Rendering (computer graphics),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lou, Ziting(louziting@163.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-40259-8_16,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319402581.0,03029743,,2016,English,Mesh generation,"E-Learning and Games - 10th International Conference, Edutainment 2016, Revised Selected Papers",12.0,182-192,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Computer Interaction; Digital Media and Interaction Research Center of Hangzhou Normal University; Hangzhou Computer Federation for Committee of Digital Media and Human-; Hangzhou Normal University; Hangzhou Science and Technology Association,Research of mesh layout algorithm based on greedy optimization strategy,,3-D mesh models - Cache Miss - Cache optimization - Greedy optimization - Mesh layout,9654
Geophys. J. Int.,"We report global phase-velocity maps of fundamental-mode Rayleighwaves at periods between 25 and 100 s based on finite-frequency tomography. Rayleigh wave dispersion measurements are made using a multitaper technique for both minor-arc and major-arc wave trains. The global phase-velocity maps confirm many features associated with surface tectonics including the ocean-continent dichotomy and the signature of lithospheric cooling in oceanic plates. In addition, the high-resolution phase-velocity maps reveal a major change in the distribution of small-scale anomalies in the Pacific at different wave periods. We calculate the global average of Rayleigh wave phase velocity in major tectonic regions and show that large discrepancies exist between our model and global crustal and mantle models: (1) In oceanic regions, shortperiod (≤~40 s) Rayleigh waves are faster than calculations based on models CRUST2.0 and S40RTS. The discrepancies could be explained by a thinner crust or faster wave speeds in the crust or upper mantle. The implementation of model CRUST1.0 significantly improves the agreement, with phase-velocity discrepancies less than 0.5 per cent on average. (2) In Archean cratons, Rayleigh wave phase velocities in our model are faster than calculations based on model S40RTS at periods longer than ~40 s; and the global average in orogenic belts is ~1-2 per cent slower than CRUST1.0 at periods shorter than ~50 s. © The Authors 2016.",,20161602244962,,"Liu, Kui (1, 2); Zhou, Ying (1, 3) ","(1) Department of Geosciences, Virginia Tech, 4044 Derring Hall, Blacksburg; VA; 2406, United States (2) Department of Geophysics, School of Resources, Environment and Earth Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (3) Institute of Theoretical and Applied Geophysics, Peking University, Beijing, China ",,481.1 Geology - 484 Seismology - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 746 Imaging Techniques,,,,,Phase velocity - Rayleigh waves - Surface waves - Tectonics - Tomography,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Kui(lkui@vt.edu) ",10.1093/gji/ggv555,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1365246X,"Number: -, Acronym: VT, Sponsor: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; Number: 2015CG002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: EAR- 1348131, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: EAR-1013617, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41374047, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We would like to thank the Editor Gabi Laske, Daniel Peter and three anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive comments.

Bull. Earthquake Engin.,"Earthquake evacuation is important to reduce casualties. To identify the requirements for a successful evacuation, we first investigated the casualties in the Ludian earthquake. Then, a simulation model was developed using a typical building destroyed during the earthquake. This model was integrated with the social force model to describe indoor earthquake evacuation behaviors under different conditions. Instantaneous average speed and social forces were estimated. Finally, the acquired safety escape time (ASET) was determined using finite-element method. We adopted the pedestrian library of AnyLogic software to calculate the required safety escape time (RSET) values under different conditions. We found that RSET was greater than ASET. Thus, people at home failed to escape. RSET varied with escaping velocity. RSET decreased as the velocity increased in a certain range. RSET was influenced by people distribution across rooms. Wall designs affected RSET. A reasonable wall layout could shorten the path distance and consequently reduce RSET. The results of the present work implied that ASET is related to earthquake ground motion (EGM). Seismic energy is concentrated at the start of EGM. Therefore, buildings collapse instantly, and people at home hardly escape from the indoors and must seek temporary security zones in their rooms. In addition, the relative velocity seismic response of a building should be considered. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,20161002049135,,"Xiao, Mei-Ling (1, 2, 3); Chen, Yang (1, 2, 3); Yan, Ming-Jiao (1, 2, 3); Ye, Liao-Yuan (1, 2, 3); Liu, Ben-Yu (1, 2, 3) ","(1) School of Urban Construction and Management, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650000, China (3) College of Resources and Environment, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",,406.2 Roads and Streets - 408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 484 Seismology - 484.2 Secondary Earthquake Effects - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Finite element method - Pedestrian safety - Seismic response - Velocity - Walls (structural partitions),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xiao, Mei-Ling(mlxiao@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s10518-016-9887-6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15731456,,,,1570761X,6,"June 1, 2016",English,Earthquakes,,37.0,1757-1769,,2016,Springer Netherlands,Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering,,Simulation of household evacuation in the 2014 Ludian earthquake,,Anylogic softwares - Earthquake ground motions - Ludian earthquake evacuation - Path choice - Relative velocity - Simulation model - Social force models - Wall layout,14

Geophys. J. Int.,"Travelling-wave Green tensor has been widely used in calculations of synthetic seismograms and finite-frequency sensitivities of surface waves. The classic travelling-wave decomposition is based on a far-field approximation and may not be valid when applied to construct sensitivity kernels in regions close to the receiver. In this paper, we calculate synthetic seismograms and finite-frequency sensitivity kernels of Rayleigh waves based on travelling-wave representation of Green tensor that fully accounts for near-field effects. We show that far-field approximation is adequate for synthetic seismograms when the source-receiver epicentral distance is greater than the dominant wavelength. Errors in Rayleigh-wave sensitivity kernels introduced by farfieldapproximation are in general negligible for single-station measurements except for in a small region around the station, and the errors are more significant in sensitivity kernels for interstation measurements. In addition, interstation measurements are strongly sensitive to structures outside the region between the two stations, even for two stations along the same great circle path from the seismic source. © The Authors 2016.",,20161602244969,,"Liu, Kui (1, 2); Zhou, Ying (2, 3) ","(1) Department of Geophysics, School of Resources, Environment and Earth Science, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China (2) Department of Geosciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg; VA; 24061, United States (3) Institute of Theoretical and Applied Geophysics, Peking University, Beijing, China ",,484 Seismology - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 921.1 Algebra,,,,,Rayleigh waves - Surface waves - Tensors - Wave transmission,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Ying(yingz@vt.edu) ",10.1093/gji/ggv564,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1365246X,"Number: 2015CG002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: EAR-1013617, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41374047, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their careful reviews and constructive comments which improved the manuscript.

Int. J. Food Sci. Technol.,"The flavour and taste of edible fungi are highly associated with the presence of several umami substances. In this study, the different edible fungi are discriminated by an electronic tongue method. The response data are analysed by the PCA (principal component analysis), DFA (discriminant factor analysis) and PLS (partial least square) method. The results show that the two data analysis methods (PCA and DFA) could successfully distinguish the variety of edible fungi. Moreover, the umami intensities of the edible fungi solutions are evaluated and compared by an electronic tongue analysis with calibration by the responses of different monosodium glutamate (MSG) concentrations. The signals are also used to build up PLS models to estimate and predict the umami intensities of the edible fungi. The results of this study indicate that the electronic tongue has a great potential in qualitative and quantitative analysis of the sensory quality of edible fungi. © 2016 Institute of Food Science and Technology.",,20161602274846,,"Feng, Tao (1); Bing, Fangling (1); Yang, Yan (2); Zhuang, Haining (2); Ye, Ran (3); Li, Xiaobei (1, 2); Xu, Zhimin (4); Wang, Kai (5) ","(1) School of Perfume and Aroma Technology, Shanghai Institute of Technology, No. 100 Hai Quan Road, Shanghai; 201418, China (2) Institute of Edible Fungi, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Edible Fungi Resources and Utilization (South), Ministry of Agriculture, National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi, 1000 Jinqi Road, Shanghai; 201403, China (3) Department of Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science, University of Tennessee, 2506 E.J.

Mater. Des.,"Gradient stripe patterns of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) were fabricated by using the evaporation-induced self-assembly technique. Additionally, the nonvolatile thin-film transistors (TFTs) with SWCNTs and (Bi,Nd)4Ti3O12(BNT) insulators were fabricated. The retention characteristics were investigated in Pt/SWCNTs/BNT/LaNiO3and LaNiO3/SWCNTs/BNT/LaNiO3structures. Results revealed that LaNiO3/SWCNTs/BNT/LaNiO3TFTs demonstrate larger on-state current, wider memory window, better fatigue endurance performance and retention characteristics, compared with Pt/SWCNTs/BNT/LaNiO3TFTs because of the involvement of the oxide conductive electrodes.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Context. Very high-energy (VHE) γ-ray measurements of distant TeV blazars can be nicely explained by TeV spectra induced by ultra high-energy cosmic rays. Aims. We develop a model for a plausible origin of hard spectra in distant TeV blazars. Methods. In the model, the TeV emission in distant TeV blazars is dominated by two mixed components. The first is the internal component with the photon energy around 1 TeV produced by inverse Compton scattering of the relativistic electrons on the synchrotron photons (SSC) with a correction for extragalactic background light absorbtion and the other is the external component with the photon energy more than 1 TeV produced by the cascade emission from high-energy protons propagating through intergalactic space. Results. Assuming suitable model parameters, we apply the model to observed spectra of distant TeV blazars of 1ES 0229+200. Our results show that 1) the observed spectrum properties of 1ES 0229+200, especially the TeV γ-ray tail of the observed spectra, could be reproduced in our model and 2) an expected TeV γ-ray spectrum with photon energy >1 TeV of 1ES 0229+200 should be comparable with the 50-h sensitivity goal of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and the differential sensitivity curve for the one-year observation with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Conclusions.

Kuei Suan Jen Hsueh Pao,"SiC/h-BN multiphase ceramics were prepared via spark plasma sintering (SPS) with t-BN and SiC nanopowders as raw materials and B2O3as a sintering additive. The phase composition and microstructure of specimens were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electronic microscopy. The effect of sintering additive content on the sintering behavior, densification, microstructure and mechanical properties of SiC/h-BN multiphase ceramics was investigated. The results show that the addition of B2O3can effectively increase the density and mechanical properties at a low sintering temperature. Compared to the samples without B2O3additive, the B2O3additive is effective to decrease the initial shrinkage temperature, promote the rearrangement of h-BN flake grains and improve the bonding strength between the grains. The density of multiphase ceramics increases, and the mechanical properties firstly increase and then decrease with the increase of sintering additive content. The relative density and mechanical properties of the sample with 5% B2O3content are better than those of other samples, and the relative density, flexural strength, fracture toughness and elastic modulus are 96.92%, 274.7 MPa, 2.91 MPa·m1/2and 127.2 GPa, respectively. However, the excessive addition of B2O3is not conducive to the improvement of mechanical properties. © 2016, Chinese Ceramic Society.

Hsi An Chiao Tung Ta Hsueh,"A background subtraction method based on decomposition of low-rank and structured sparsity matrices is proposed to solve the problem that detection results are sensitive to noise and incomplete caused by ignoring the relationship between foreground pixels in traditional foreground detection methods based on matrix decomposition. The method takes the structural distribution of the foreground into account, and a structured sparsity constraint is used on the foreground pixels. Moreover, a two-stage framework based on motion saliency is introduced to address the parameter setting issue in dynamic background videos and to tune regularization parameters adaptively. Motion block candidates are obtained by using the low rank and structured sparsity decomposition in the first step. Then, motion saliency analysis is applied to these candidates and the adapt block sparsity decomposition is used to detect the foreground in the second step. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is more adaptive than the existing foreground detection methods based on matrix decomposition in complex videos, and that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods according to the precision and recall results on dataset I2R. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

MATEC Web Conf.,"There are less researches in the influence of disturbance of endogenous phosphorus release in sediment. The correlational analysis only takes the disturbance as one of the many factors in influencing the phosphorus release. It hasn't been able to make a deeper discussion from disturbance itself. In this paper, HAOHE River of Nantong, China is selected as study area. The whole process of disturbance is simulated in the laboratory. Disturbance intensity, time and depth is respectively simulated and analysed their effects on endogenous phosphorus release in sediment. The result shows that the external disturbance can significantly increase the release of endogenous phosphorus in sediment. From the time series of the experimental results, the release of phosphorus is not increased with the increasing time. The depth experiment has showed that the maximum phosphorus release is closest to the sediment and the closest to the water surface, while the phosphorus release in the position of middle depth is less. © 2016 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",Open Access,20163502758186,04025,"Lu, Xiu (1); Li, Jia (1); Duan, Ping (1) ","(1) School of Tourism and Geographical Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Yunnan, China ",,483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 804 Chemical Products Generally,122667.0,"June 11, 2016 - June 12, 2016","Hong Kong, Hong kong","2016 International Conference on Mechatronics, Manufacturing and Materials Engineering, MMME 2016",Manufacture - Sediments,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Jia(keguigiser@163.com) ",10.1051/matecconf/20166304025,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),2261236X,,,,,,"July 12, 2016",English,Phosphorus,"2016 International Conference on Mechatronics, Manufacturing and Materials Engineering, MMME 2016",5.0,,1of1,2016,EDP Sciences,MATEC Web of Conferences,HongKong Control Engineering and Information Science Research Association; International Frontiers of science and technology Research Association; National Chin-Yi University of Technology,"Simulation of influence of disturbance on the release of endogenous phosphorus in sediment of HAOHE River of Nantong, China",,Correlational analysis - External disturbances - Nantong - Phosphorus release - Study areas - Water surface - Whole process,63

Phys. Rev. B,"Long-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction is critically important for intermolecular interactions in molecular complexes and solids. However, accurate modeling of vdW coefficients presents a great challenge for nanostructures, in particular for fullerene clusters, which have huge vdW coefficients but also display very strong nonadditivity. In this work, we calculate the coefficients between fullerenes, fullerene and sodium clusters, and fullerene and alkali atoms with the hollow-sphere model within the modified single-frequency approximation (MSFA). In the MSFA, we assume that the electron density is uniform in a molecule and that only valence electrons in the outmost subshell of atoms contribute. The input to the model is the static multipole polarizability, which provides a sharp cutoff for the plasmon contribution outside the effective vdW radius. We find that the model can generate C6 in excellent agreement with expensive wave-function-based ab initio calculations, with a mean absolute relative error of only 3%, without suffering size-dependent error. We show that the nonadditivities of the coefficients C6 between fullerenes and C60 and sodium clusters Nan revealed by the model agree remarkably well with those based on the accurate reference values. The great flexibility, simplicity, and high accuracy make the model particularly suitable for the study of the nonadditivity of vdW coefficients between nanostructures, advancing the development of better vdW corrections to conventional density functional theory. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,20191906871687,085126,"Tao, Jianmin (1); Mo, Yuxiang (1); Tian, Guocai (1, 2); Ruzsinszky, Adrienn (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Temple University, Philadelphia; PA; 19122-1801, United States (2) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",,549.1 Alkali Metals - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921 Mathematics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Atoms - Calculations - Density functional theory - Fullerenes - Nanostructures - Sodium - Wave functions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tao, Jianmin(jianmin.tao@temple.edu) ",10.1103/PhysRevB.94.085126,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),24699969,"Number: -, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: 51264021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: CHE 1640584, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Stroke Foundation; ",J.T. and Y.M. acknowledge support from the NSF under Grant No. CHE 1640584.

All of them were successfully applied in polymer light-emitting diodes: ITO/PEDOT: PSS (40 nm)/PVK: PBD: complex (mass ratios 100: 40: x, x = 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0) (80 nm)/CsF (1.5 nm)/Al (100 nm). The maximum luminances were 8733 cd m-2, 8878 cd m-2and 13019 cd m-2, the maximum luminance efficiencies were 13.7 cd A-1, 12.5 cd A-1and 17.5 cd A-1respectively. Because the steric hindrance of two methyls increase the distance between central Ir3+and BCP, and the conjugated plane of 1,10-phenanthroline unit in BCP are distorted by two benzene rings, the flow of electrons are partly hindered, [(CBT)2Ir(BCP)]PF6exhibits the lowest electroluminescent performances.

Int. J. Online Eng.,"With the growth of big data problems, nowadays the size of cloud-scale computing clusters is growing rapidly to run complicated parallel processing jobs. To full utilize cluster resources, the cluster management system is being challenged by the scaling cloud size and the often more complicated application requirements. Omega scheduling software provides a flexible and scalable shared-state scheduling architecture for large scale cluster scheduling. One of its key ideas is using an optimistic concurrency control (OCC) algorithm to let parallel schedulers concurrently make decisions. However, there are few studies exploring to extend OCC for a shared-state scheduling architecture. Furthermore, most of the traditional' shared-state scheduling architectures also use the same OCCs as Omega does. In this paper, we present a multi attribute Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory based OCC for shared-state scheduling. This OCC adapts the multi attribute D-S evidence theory to help making conflict decisions for some scheduling transactions. Experiments' results show that our method can obtain in some respects more optimized scheduling results compared to coarse-grained conflict detection of Omega.",,20170403284784,,"He, Libo (1); Qiang, Zhenping (1); Zhou, Wei (2); Yao, Shaowen (2) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering in Yunnan University, No.2 Cuihu North Rd, Kunming City, China (2) School of Software in Yunnan University, No.2 Cuihu North Rd, Kunming City, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 912.2 Management",,,,,Big data - Cluster computing - Computation theory - Concurrency control,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.3991/ijoe.v12i12.6457,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18612121,,,,18681646,12,2016,English,Scheduling,,26.0,43-48,,2016,"Kassel University Press GmbH, Diagonale 10, Kassel, 34127, Germany",International Journal of Online Engineering,,Multi attribute D-S evidence theory based OCC for shared-state scheduling in large scale cluster,,Application requirements - Cluster management system - D S evidence theory - Dempster-Shafer evidence theory - Large-scale clusters - Optimistic concurrency controls - Scheduling architecture - Shared state,12
Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng. Part D J. Automob. Eng.,"In this paper, the strategies for emission controls to achieve clean and high-efficiency combustion were studied in detail in a common-rail heavy-duty diesel engine coupled with exhaust gas recirculation. The results show that, in comparison with a single-stage turbocharger, a two-stage turbocharger dramatically improves the exhaust gas recirculation recyclability and enhances the air-to-fuel mass flow ratio. Therefore, nitrogen oxide emissions can be reduced to a much lower level, and the nitrogen oxide-brake specific fuel consumption trade-off relationship as well as the nitrogen oxide-soot trade-off relationship can be greatly improved simultaneously at low-speed high-load conditions. However, the peak cylinder pressure increases evidently at high-load conditions for a two-stage turbocharger. The brake specific fuel consumption, the soot emissions and the peak cylinder pressure can be lowered simultaneously by appropriately reducing the compression ratio and optimizing the geometry of the combustion chamber (such as the re-entrant diameter and the bowl depth) as well as using an injector with a tapered nozzle hole. At low- speed high-load conditions, the soot emissions can be reduced obviously without serious penalties in the brake specific fuel consumption when the nitrogen oxide emissions were kept constant by delaying the main-injection timing and reducing the injection pressure. However, it is necessary to employ a higher injection pressure together with a post-injection to reduce the brake specific fuel consumption and the soot emissions at high speeds. The combustion characteristics are mainly dominated by the cetane number of the fuel. With the addition of lower-cetane-number fuel to pure diesel, the ignition delay is prolonged as the exhaust gas recirculation rate increases, thereby also increasing the premixed combustion and reducing the soot emissions sharply. Meanwhile, the crank angle at which there is 50% completion of the accumulated heat release has less influence on the brake thermal efficiency with the addition of lower-cetane-number fuel. 2,5-dimethylfuran, as a novel oxygenated biofuel with a lower cetane number, is superior to gasoline for reducing the soot emissions, which may be a promising and clean alternative in compression ignition engines coupled with exhaust gas recirculation. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.",,20161102087730,,"Chen, Guisheng (1); Di, Lei (1); Shen, Yinggang (1); Zhang, Wei (1); Mao, Bin (2) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Internal Combustion Engine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, 727 South Jingming Road, Chenggong District, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Engines, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China ",PMDEEA,451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 521.1 Fuel Combustion - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 602 Mechanical Drives and Transmissions - 612.1.1 Internal Combustion Engine Components - 612.2 Diesel Engines - 654.2 Rocket Engines - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Brakes - Combustion chambers - Compression ratio (machinery) - Dust - Economic and social effects - Efficiency - Exhaust gas recirculation - Fuel consumption - Fuels - Gas emissions - Ignition - Nitrogen oxides - Soot - Superchargers - Turbomachinery,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Guisheng(cgs_yly@163.com) ",10.1177/0954407015590036,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,09544070,5,"April 1, 2016",English,Diesel engines,,36.0,593-608,,2016,SAGE Publications Ltd,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering",,Strategies for emissions control in heavy-duty diesel engines to achieve low-emissions combustion with a high efficiency,,Control strategies - Fuel properties - Heavy-duty diesel engine - Low emission - Turbocharging systems,230
RSC Adv.,"A novel water-soluble oral satraplatin/β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex was prepared and characterized with a variety of techniques. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to clarify its inclusion mechanism. Enabled by encapsulation with cyclodextrin, the water solubility of satraplatin was successfully increased to 7.4 mg mL-1and significantly improved by phase solubility studies. Meanwhile, the stability of satraplatin in acidic and weak alkaline aqueous solution was also effectively enhanced by forming the inclusion complex. Importantly, in an in vitro cytotoxicity test, the satraplatin encapsulated complex displayed superior cytotoxicity compared to free satraplatin against A549 and MCF-7 cells but was almost non-toxic to Caco-2 cells. In an in vivo antitumor test, this satraplatin encapsulated complex has shown much better activity in repressing lung cancer than free satraplatin but nearly no damage to intestinal mucosa by oral administration evaluated in xenograft mice models. Overall, the development of the current satraplatin/β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex has significantly improved the bioavailability of satraplatin and could benefit further applications in related pharmaceutical formulations. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,20160801973068,,"Zhang, Jian-Qiang (1); Li, Ke (2); Jiang, Kun-Ming (1); Cong, Yan-Wei (3); Pu, Shao-Ping (3); Xie, Xiao-Guang (1); Jin, Yi (1); Lin, Jun (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource (Yunnan University), Ministry Education, Advanced Analysis and Measurement Center, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Second Department of Medical Oncology, Kunming Medical University, Tumor Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650018, China (3) Kunming Guiyan Pharmaceutical Co., Itd., Kunming; 650093, China ",RSCACL,801.2 Biochemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Biochemistry - Cyclodextrins - Molecular dynamics - Solubility - Solutions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pu, Shao-Ping(pushaoping@163.com) ",10.1039/c5ra27182g,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 2015J004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: IRT13095, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 21442006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21262043, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1202221, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (No. IRT13095), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21262043, U1202221 and 21442006), the Science Research Fund of Yunnan Provincial Education Department (2015J004).

Int. J. on Artif. Intell. Tools,"Discovering different groups, or called classes, is useful for pattern recognition, data preprocessing, association analysis, query optimization, etc. To make every object satisfied as much as possible, the groups are generated by the associations or behaviors among participating objects other than the attributes owned by themselves. By mainly considering the mutual associations among the given objects and based on the game theory, in this paper we study the multi-objective oriented categorization. Based on the idea of Shapley value in the coalitional game, we first propose the concept of priority groups and give the efficient algorithm for computing the satisfaction degree of players in a group. Based on the idea of strategic games and Nash equilibrium, we then give the algorithm for computing an approximate equilibrium to solve the conflicts between the strategies of players, and consequently achieve the ultimate multi-objective oriented groups.

J. Interdiscip. Math.,"In computational chemistry and graph theory, the revised edge-Szeged index and revised Szeged index were introduced to measure the properties of drugs and chemical compounds. As the extension of Szeged index and edge-Szeged index, the revised version Szeged index and edge-Szeged index is more available to test the characteristics of chemical molecular structures, and thus widely used in chemical applications.

Neurocomputing,"With the rapid development of computer vision and pattern recognition, face recognition, one of the basic research topics in computer vision and pattern recognition, has received intensive attention in recent years. Usually, traditional face recognition algorithms have considerable discriminant ability; however, when there are some samples that are easy to confuse in the face database, the discriminant ability of traditional face recognition algorithms will inevitably decrease. In this paper, based on the patch alignment framework (PAF) and Cauchy estimator theory, we proposed a novelty subspace learning algorithm for face recognition named Cauchy estimator discriminant analysis (CEDA). Under the framework of PAF, both local and global geometries of the input samples are preserved; by using the Cauchy estimator, large errors caused by samples that are easy to confuse could be overcome. We conducted the experiments on three face databases and strongly illustrated the effectiveness of CEDA for face recognition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162002392753,,"Yang, Xipeng (1); Cheng, Jun (2, 3); Feng, Wei (2, 3); Liang, Hong (1); Bai, Zhengyao (1); Tao, Dapeng (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Robotics and Intelligent System, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (3) The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong ",NRCGEO,723.5 Computer Applications - 922 Statistical Methods,,,,,Computer vision - Discriminant analysis - Learning algorithms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tao, Dapeng(dapeng.tao@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.neucom.2016.03.026,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18728286,"Number: 201001D0104648280, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: JCYJ20140417113430736, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20140901003939001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20130402113127502, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JSGG20140703092631382, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JSGG20141015153303491, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014A030310252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 61572486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61402458, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61572486 and 61402458 , the Guangdong Natural Science Funds under Grant 2014A030310252 , Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program under Grant 201001D0104648280 , the Shenzhen Technology Project under Grants JCYJ20130402113127502 , JCYJ20140417113430736 , JCYJ20140901003939001 , JSGG20140703092631382 , and JSGG20141015153303491 .",,09252312,,"July 26, 2016",English,Face recognition,,39.0,144-153,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Neurocomputing,,Cauchy estimator discriminant analysis for face recognition,,Cauchy estimator - Face database - Face recognition algorithms - Global geometries - Input sample - Patch alignment framework - Research topics - Subspace learning,199
Astron. Astrophys.,"Context. We model the dust and free-free continuum emission in the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2. Aims. We want to reconstruct the 3D density and dust temperature distribution, as a crucial input to follow-up studies of the gas velocity field and molecular abundances. Methods. We employ the 3D radiative transfer program RADMC-3D to calculate the dust temperature self-consistently, providing a given initial density distribution. This density distribution of the entire cloud complex is then recursively reconstructed, based on available continuum maps, including both single-dish and high-resolution interferometric maps that cover a wide frequency range (ν = 40 GHz-4 THz). The model covers spatial scales from 45 pc down to 100 au, i.e., a spatial dynamic range of 105. Results. We find that the density distribution of Sagittarius B2 can be reasonably well fitted by applying a superposition of spherical cores with Plummer-like density profiles. To reproduce the spectral energy distribution, we position Sgr B2(N) along the line of sight behind the plane containing Sgr B2(M). We find that the entire cloud complex comprises a total gas mass of 8.0 × 106Mowithin a diameter of 45 pc. This corresponds to an averaged gas density of 170 Mopc-3. We estimate stellar masses of 2400 Moand 20 700 Moand luminosities of 1.8 × 106Loand 1.2 × 107Lofor Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M), respectively. We report H2column densities of 2.9 × 1024cm-2for Sgr B2(N) and 2.5 × 1024cm-2for Sgr B2(M) in a 40′′ beam. For Sgr B2(S), we derive a stellar mass of 1100 Mo, a luminosity of 6.6 × 105Lo, and an H2column density of 2.2 × 1024cm-2in a 40′′ beam. We calculate a star formation efficiency of 5% for Sgr B2(N) and 50% for Sgr B2(M). This indicates that most of the gas content in Sgr B2(M) has already been converted to stars or dispersed. © ESO, 2016.",Open Access,20161702304131,A143,"Schmiedeke, A. (1); Schilke, P.

To elucidate the physiological mechanism of resistance induced by MeJA, the contents of superoxide anion free radical and MDA, and different pigments (chlorophyll a, b and carotenoid) were measured. Also, the activities of pathogen-resistance related Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) and anti-oxygen enzymes Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO), Peroxidase (POD) and Catalase (CAT) were analyzed. The results showed that MeJA can effectively inhibit the growth rate of seedlings, increase the contents of chlorophyll a and b, decrease the MDA level, and promote the activities of enzyme PAL and anti-oxygen enzymes POX, POD and CAT. Thus, MeJA can induce the system resistance of potato to common scab and could be used as anti-pathogenic agent for potato common scab control. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,20161202135449,,"Deng, Guobin (1); Deng, Qing (2); Zhang, Gensong (2); Chen, Erjuan (3); Chen, Xiaolan (3) ","(1) Yunnan Academy of Biodiversity, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming; Yunnan Province, China (2) Yunnan Chechuan Biotechnology Co.

J. Biol. Chem.,"Coumarin and its derivatives are fragrant natural compounds isolated from the genus Murraya that are flowering plants widely distributed in East Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Murraya plants have been widely used as medicinal herbs for relief of pain, such as headache, rheumatic pain, toothache, and snake bites. However, little is known about their analgesic components and the molecular mechanism underlying pain relief. Here, we report the bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of a novel coumarin derivative, named muralatin L, that can specifically activate the nociceptor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel and reverse the inflammatory pain in mice through channel desensitization. Muralatin L was identified from the active extract of Murraya alata against TRPV1 transiently expressed in HEK- 293T cells in fluorescent calcium FlexStation assay. Activation of TRPV1 current by muralatin L and its selectivity were further confirmed by whole-cell patch clamp recordings of TRPV1-expressing HEK-293T cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons isolated from mice. Furthermore, muralatin L could reverse inflammatory pain induced by formalin and acetic acid in mice but not in TRPV1 knock-out mice. Taken together, our findings show that muralatin L specifically activates TRPV1 and reverses inflammatory pain, thus highlighting the potential of coumarin derivatives from Murraya plants for pharmaceutical and medicinal applications such as pain therapy. © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Despite this view, no empirical studies have explicitly examined roles of different soil fauna within trophic levels in mediating cascading effects of predators in detritus food webs. Here we manipulated the density of a dominant funnel-web building spider Macrothele yunnanica in permanent plots (1 m2) for one year. Three spider treatments were applied: 0 spiders, 6 spiders (natural density) and 10 spiders (high density). We found that although changes in spider densities caused large shifts in litter-dwelling Collembola community composition on average, modifying spider densities did not generate a trophic cascade effect and alter litter decomposition in litter bags with coarse mesh (2 mm). Our data supports the hypothesis that functional redundancy among Collembola species may weaken the strength of spider-initiated cascading effects. Consequently, changes in Collembola diversity occupying the same trophic level may not significantly alter ecosystem function in tropical forest-floor ecosystems. © 2016.",Open Access,20161502233400,,"Liu, Shengjie (1, 2); Behm, Jocelyn E.

J. Phys. Conf. Ser.,"In order to obtain higher stray radiation suppression of a cold shield and enhance the cold shield efficiency of cooled infrared system, different configurations of the vanes inside cold shield are proposed. The effects of these configurations of vanes on stray radiation suppression are simulated and analysed by Advanced Systems Analysis Program (ASAP software), which not only trace ray by Monte Carlo method but also simulate the scattering of each surface. According to the analysis of results, vane plays an important role in the improvement of cold shield efficiency and the suppression of stray radiation. The cold shield with 6 vanes characterized by rounded-square hole, whose configuration is calculated based on the principle of laying out a set of vanes, suppresses 99.5% more stray radiation comparing to the original one without any vanes. However, considering that the cold shield with 6 vanes is complicated and difficult to fabricate, the cold shield with 3 vanes owing rounded-square hole is selected, since its stray radiation suppression level is acceptable.",Open Access,20161802335936,012015,"Zhang, Xianjing (1); Bai, Jian (1); Yin, Shuang (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Modem Optical Instrumentation, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (2) Kunming Institute of Physics, Yunnan; 650223, China ",,741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 913.1 Production Engineering - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science,119906.0,"October 28, 2015 - October 31, 2015","Hangzhou, China","5th International Conference on Advances in Optoelectronics and Micro/Nano-Optics, AOM 2015",Efficiency - Monte Carlo methods - Optical design - Optoelectronic devices - Stray light - Systems analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bai, Jian(bai@zju.edu.cn) ",10.1088/1742-6596/680/1/012015,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),17426596,,,,17426588,1,"February 3, 2016",English,Radiation effects,"5th International Conference on Advances in Optoelectronics and Micro/Nano-Optics, AOM 2015",1.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Physics Publishing,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,,The optical design of highly efficient cold shield in IR detector based on ASAP,,Advanced systems analysis programs - Cold shield - Cooled InfraRed - Square holes - Stray radiation,680

Cluster Comput.,"Ground-based radar interferometry, an innovative technology for surface deformation monitoring has the advantages of high-security, high-resolution, adapting to all kinds of weather conditions and so on. Ground-based radar interferometry using microwave signal as transmission signal, is susceptible to atmospheric disturbance. How to eliminate the atmospheric disturbance influence is the key to achieve high-precision monitoring. Accordingly, this article aims at developing an effective atmospheric disturbance correction model. Firstly, IBIS- L system and corner reflectors as the stable points were placed. Secondly, microwave refractive index was calculated through the atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, according to the additional displacement acquired by IBIS-L system, the radial distance, azimuth distance of corner reflectors, and microwave refractive index, the atmospheric disturbance correction model in using IBIS-L system for slope monitoring was established. Finally, the additional displacement calculated from the model is in comparison with additional displacement by IBIS-L system monitoring. Experiments show that, the model can effectively eliminate the influence of atmospheric disturbance, and ensure monitoring accuracy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,20164202916737,,"Zuo, Xiaoqing (1); Yu, Hongchu (1); Zi, Chenbo (2); Xu, Xiaokun (2) ","(1) Faculty of Land and Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, No. 68, Wenchang Lane, Wuhua District, Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650093, China (2) Huaneng Lancang River Hydropower CO., LTD, Kunming; 650214, China ",,716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 741.1 Light/Optics - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements,,,,,Deformation - Interferometry - Radar - Reflection - Refractive index,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zuo, Xiaoqing(hongshuxifan8140@163.com) ",10.1007/s10586-016-0664-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15737543,,,,13867857,4,"December 1, 2016",English,Monitoring,,22.0,2157-2167,,2016,Springer New York LLC,Cluster Computing,,The atmospheric disturbance correction model in slope deformation monitoring using IBIS-L system,,Atmospheric disturbance - Atmospheric parameters - Corner reflector - Correction models - L-systems - Slope monitoring,19
IEEE Comput. Soc. Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recogn. Workshops,"Background subtraction is a basic problem for change detection in videos and also the first step of high-level computer vision applications. Most background subtraction methods rely on color and texture feature. However, due to illuminations changes in different scenes and affections of noise pixels, those methods often resulted in high false positives in a complex environment. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive background subtraction model which uses a novel Local SVD Binary Pattern (named LSBP) feature instead of simply depending on color intensity. This feature can describe the potential structure of the local regions in a given image, thus, it can enhance the robustness to illumination variation, noise, and shadows. We use a sample consensus model which is well suited for our LSBP feature. Experimental results on CDnet 2012 dataset demonstrate that our background subtraction method using LSBP feature is more effective than many state-of-the-art methods. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170403285885,7789638,"Guo, Lili (1); Xu, Dan (1); Qiang, Zhenping (1, 2) ","(1) School of Information and Engineering, Yunnan University, China (2) Department of Computer and Information Science, Southwest Forestry University, China ",,723.5 Computer Applications,125617.0,"June 26, 2016 - July 1, 2016","Las Vegas, NV, United states","29th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, CVPRW 2016",Image enhancement,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Dan(danxu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1109/CVPRW.2016.148,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),21607516,,,9781467388504.0,21607508,,"December 16, 2016",English,Computer vision,"Proceedings - 29th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, CVPRW 2016",26.0,1159-1167,1of1,2016,IEEE Computer Society,IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops,,Background Subtraction Using Local SVD Binary Pattern,,Adaptive background subtractions - Background subtraction - Background subtraction method - Color and texture features - Complex environments - High-level computer vision - Illumination variation - State-of-the-art methods,0
RSC Adv.,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)@MnOOH core-shell nanocomposites, in which the CNTs core is uniformly coated with a shell of MnOOH nanoflakes, were successfully synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method. The appearance of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) plays a key role in forming the unique CNTs@MnOOH core-shell. A high dielectric loss tangent value was observed for the samples with/without SDBS. Significantly, the CNTs@MnOOH core-shell nanocomposites exhibit an electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of 13-15 dB in the frequency range of 8-18 GHz, which can be attributed to the improved absorption loss, resulting from the increased electrical conductivity, and the improved impedance matching of the core-shell structure.

By incorporating a total-field/scattered-field boundary, the simulation domain is restricted inside a tightly bounded region. The incident field is further synthesized by the Fourier transform for both subcritical and supercritical incidences. Finally, the scattered far field is computed using a half-space Green's function.

RSC Adv.,"Residues of gentamicin in food pose a threat to human health. Determining gentamicin residues relies largely on adequate analytical techniques. Herein, a simple and highly specific colorimetric method for effective detection of this aminoglycoside antibiotic in milk based on gentamicin-induced collapse of an Au-lipid capsule is first proposed. The strong interaction between gentamicin and phosphatidylcholine resulted in the collapse of Au-lipid capsule and consequently, the color of AuNPs changed from wine red to blue. The concentration of gentamicin could be determined with the naked eye or a UV-vis spectrometer. The results showed that the absorption ratio (A664/A531) was liner with the gentamicin concentration in the 0-0.2 μM range with a linear 0.99 correlation coefficient. The detection limit was 7.4 nM. The coexisting substances, including l-arginine, guanidine hydrochloride, Tween-20, ammonium hydroxide, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, glucose, and other common antibiotics such as streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin and carbenicillin, did not interfere with the gentamicin determination with this method.

The corresponding traveling wave system is a singular planar dynamical system with one singular straight line. On the basis of the theory of the singular traveling wave systems, we obtain the bifurcations of phase portraits and explicit exact parametric representations for solitary wave solutions and smooth periodic wave solutions, as well as periodic peakon solutions. We show the existence of compacton solutions of the equation under different parameter conditions. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,20163902856407,1650172,"Zhu, Wenjing (1); Li, Jibin (1, 2) ","(1) Department of Mathematics, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, Zhejiang, China (2) Department of Mathematics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,921.2 Calculus,,,,,Bifurcation (mathematics) - Dynamical systems - Solitons - Surface waves,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Jibin(lijb@zjnu.cn) ",10.1142/S0218127416501728,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,02181274,10,"September 1, 2016",English,Equations of motion,,10.0,,,2016,World Scientific Publishing Co.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","A novel strategy for selective and sensitive electrochemical lead ion (Pb2+) biosensor was developed based on the single-stranded DNAzyme catalytic beacon. A DNAzyme that requires Pb2+for activation was selected and labeled with redox-active ferrocene (Fc) for signal transducer. The Fc-labeled single-stranded DNAzyme (Fc-ssDNAzyme) was self-assembled through S–Au bonding on a gold electrode surface. In the presence of Pb2+, the ssDNAzyme was activated and catalyzed the hydrolytic cleavage of the substrate strand, resulting in the removal of the substrate strand along with the Fc from the Au electrode surface. The dissociation of Fc caused a decrease of electrochemical signal (“signal-off”). Under the optimal conditions, the electrochemical signal of Fc decreased directly with the increasing Pb2+concentration, exhibiting a linear response in the range of 0.5 nM to 5 μM with a detection limit of 0.25 nM. This strategy is simple, sensitive and selective with the minimal reagents and working steps, thereby holds great potential for Pb2+detection in real environmental sample analysis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20153501214543,,"Zhang, Yanli (1); Xiao, Shixiu (1); Li, Haizhen (1); Liu, Hongjun (1); Pang, Pengfei (1); Wang, Hongbin (1); Wu, Zhan (2); Yang, Wenrong (1, 3) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Chemistry in Ethnic Medicinal Resources, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650031, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, Hunan University, Changsha; 410082, China (3) School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, Geelong; VIC; 3217, Australia ",SABCEB,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Biosensors - Electrodes - Gold compounds - Ions - Iron compounds - Organometallics - Redox reactions - Sulfur compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pang, Pengfei(pengfeipang@yahoo.com) ",10.1016/j.snb.2015.08.046,Engineering Village,Compendex,Article in Press,,"Number: 21205104, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21463028, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21205104 and 21463028), International Education Cooperation Base of Yunnan Minzu University (YMU 218-02001001002129), Graduate Student Project (2014J075) of Department of Education of Yunnan Province, and partially supported by the Open Funding Project of the State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics (No. 2013014), Hunan University, PR China.",,09254005,,January 2016,English,Nitrogen compounds,,,1083-1089,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,"Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical",,A Pb2+-ion electrochemical biosensor based on single-stranded DNAzyme catalytic beacon,,Electrochemical biosensor - Electrochemical signals - Environmental sample analysis - Ferrocenes - Hydrolytic cleavage - Lead ions - Signal transducers - Single-stranded dnazyme,222

"IEEE Int. Conf. Real-Time Comput. Robot., RCAR","Face recognition is a crucial part of object recognition in robot research area, which the scholarly community has shown an intensive attention in the past few years. However, face recognition is still a difficult task since face images are easily confused by changes of the conditions, such as illumination, the different expression, or glasses. The goal of this paper is to address the problem when there are affected images in the dataset. Based on the Cauchy estimator theory and patch alignment framework (PAF), we proposed a dimensional reduction algorithm termed Cauchy estimator discriminant analysis (CEDA) for face recognition. CEDA not only preserves geometry structure of the input samples but also decrease the errors caused by confused samples. Extensive experiments were conducted on the UMIST dataset and demonstrated robustness and effectiveness of the proposed CEDA. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170403280311,7784053,"Yang, Xipeng (1); Cheng, Jun (2, 3); Feng, Wei (2, 3); Liang, Hong (4); Bai, Zhengyao (4); Tao, Dapeng (4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Digital Publishing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen; 518055, China (2) Laboratory for Human Machine Control, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen; 518055, China (3) Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong (4) Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 731.5 Robotics - 922 Statistical Methods",125434.0,"June 6, 2016 - June 9, 2016","No. 555, Phum Kruos, Sangkat Svay Dangkum, Siem Reap, Cambodia","2016 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2016",Computation theory - Discriminant analysis - Object recognition - Robotics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/RCAR.2016.7784053,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467389594.0,,,"December 14, 2016",English,Face recognition,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2016",26.0,352-356,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2016",et al.; Harbin Institute of Technology; IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS); Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); National University of Defense Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Face recognition by combining cauchy estimator and discriminant analysis,,Dimensional reduction - Face images - Geometry structure - Input sample,
ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,"In this study, yolk-shell Ni@SnO2composites with a designable interspace were successfully prepared by the simple acid etching hydrothermal method. The Ni@void@SnO2composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that interspaces exist between the Ni cores and SnO2shells. Moreover, the void can be adjusted by controlling the hydrothermal reaction time. The unique yolk-shell Ni@void@SnO2composites show outstanding electromagnetic wave absorption properties. A minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of -50.2 dB was obtained at 17.4 GHz with absorber thickness of 1.5 mm. In addition, considering the absorber thickness, minimal reflection loss, and effective bandwidth, a novel method to judge the effective microwave absorption properties is proposed. On the basis of this method, the best microwave absorption properties were obtained with a 1.7 mm thick absorber layer (RLmin= -29.7 dB, bandwidth of 4.8 GHz). The outstanding electromagnetic wave absorption properties stem from the unique yolk-shell structure. These yolk-shell structures can tune the dielectric properties of the Ni@air@SnO2composite to achieve good impedance matching. Moreover, the designable interspace can induce interfacial polarization, multiple reflections, and microwave plasma. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,20164502995550,,"Zhao, Biao (1, 2); Guo, Xiaoqin (1, 2); Zhao, Wanyu (3); Deng, Jiushuai (4); Shao, Gang (3); Fan, Bingbing (3); Bai, Zhongyi (1, 2); Zhang, Rui (1, 3) ","(1) Provincial Key Laboratory of Aviation Materials and Application Technology, Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics, Zhengzhou, Henan; 450046, China (2) School of Mechatronics Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics, Zhengzhou, Henan; 450046, China (3) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan; 450001, China (4) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",,"408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 714.3 Waveguides - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Bandwidth - Circular waveguides - Dielectric properties of solids - Electromagnetic wave absorption - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Microwaves - Polarization - Scanning electron microscopy - Shells (structures) - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Biao(zhaobiao1813@163.com) ",10.1021/acsami.6b10886,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19448252,"Number: 2014M561996, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 51402264, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51672254 51602287, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors appreciate the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 51672254 51602287, and 51402264), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grants 2014M561996).",,19448244,42,"October 26, 2016",English,X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,,67.0,28917-28925,,2016,American Chemical Society,ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,,Yolk-Shell Ni@SnO2Composites with a Designable Interspace to Improve the Electromagnetic Wave Absorption Properties,,Electromagnetic parameters - Interfacial polarization - Microwave absorption - Multiple reflections - Yolk-shell structures,8

Silicon (Si) coating has been introduced to the surface of the Gfto investigate the thermal conductivity and flexural strength of Gf/Cu composites. Microstructural analysis demonstrates that (i) the high thermal conductivity of Gf/Cu composites is attributed to the homogeneous dispersion and well-controlled alignment of Gfin the composite matrix and (ii) silicon coating on the Gfslightly decreases the thermal conductivity of the composites, but greatly improves the bending strength. Compared with the raw Gf/Cu composites, the thermal conductivity of the Si-coated Gf/Cu composites along the plane parallel to the graphite laminate decreases from 676 to 610 W (m-1K-1) when the volume fraction of Gfreaches 70 vol%. The bending strength of Si-coated graphite/Cu composites is significantly enhanced and the maximum bending strength is 110 MPa when the volume fraction of graphite is 40%.

J. Internet Technol.,"Be different from traditional Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) access control systems for cloud computing, this paper first proposes a new access architecture on mobile cloud, which introduces a middle layer sitting between mobile devices and their cloud infrastructure. This middle layer is composed of cloudlets which are deployed next to wireless network access points (APs) and serve as a localized service point at a mobile devices close proximity to improve the performance of mobile cloud services. Based on this new architecture, an ABE access control scheme is proposed to offload the main amount of computations to the cloudlet as the function of cloud, in which the access control decision making takes into consideration energy consumption of access task execution and network status while satisfying certain response time constraints.

The proposed algorithm is designed based on matrix-value operator learning techniques where the image patches are understood as the matrices and the single-image super-resolution is treated as a problem of learning a matrix-value operator. Taking advantage of the matrix trick, the proposed algorithm is so fast that it could be trained on social image data. To our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the fastest single-image super-resolution algorithm when both training and test time are considered.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Person re-identification aims to match the same pedestrians across different camera views and has been applied to many important applications such as intelligent video surveillance. Due to the spatiotemporal uncertainty and visual ambiguity of pedestrian image pairs, person re-identification remains a difficult and challenging problem. The huge success of deep learning has focused attention on the use of deep features for person re-identification. However, for person re-identification, most deep learning methods minimize cross-entropy or triplet-based losses, thereby neglecting the fact that the similarities and differences between image pairs can be considered simultaneously to increase discrimination. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method called deep similarity feature learning (DSFL) to extract more effective deep features for image pairs. Extensive experiments on two representative person re-identification datasets (CUHK-03 and GRID) demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DSFL. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,20165203193098,,"Guo, Yanan (1); Tao, Dapeng (1); Yu, Jun (2); Li, Yaotang (1) ","(1) Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China ",,914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,187409.0,"September 15, 2016 - September 16, 2016","Xi’an, China","17th Pacific-Rim Conference on Multimedia, PCM 2016",Image processing - Security systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tao, Dapeng(dapeng.tao@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-48890-5_38,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: JCYJ20140901003939001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Nvidia; Number: 2014A030310252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: LR15F020002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province; Number: -, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61572486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11361074, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472110, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572486, 61472110, and 11361074, the Guangdong Natural Science Funds under Grant 2014A030310252,the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant LR15F020002, the Shenzhen Technology Project under Grant JCYJ20140901003939001, the Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University.

In this paper, the structure and physical properties of titanium suboxides are summarized, and recent progress in their synthesis methods and applications in catalysis, environmental, electronic and optoelectronic devices and batteries is reviewed. The presence of two Ti3+and (n - 2)Ti4+provides TinO2n-1with several possible configurations of cations in the crystal, various charge-ordered states and electronic structures which lead to their versatile physical properties, such as conductivity, magnetic and optical properties. A series of TinO2n-1has been synthesized by redox reduction of different titanium sources of TiO2and other raw materials. Notably, Magnéli phase titanium oxides (typically n is between 4 and 6) have played very important roles in Pt-catalyst support, organic degradation, coatings and supports in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. Undoubtedly, titanium suboxides are expected to become indispensable materials in future. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20163602773197,,"Xu, Baoqiang (1); Sohn, Hong Yong (2); Mohassab, Yousef (2); Lan, Yuanpei (2, 3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clear Utilization, National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory for Nonferrous Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Department of Metallurgical Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City; UT; 84112, United States (3) College of Material Science and Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China ",RSCACL,408 Structural Design - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Catalyst supports - Crystal structure - Electronic structure - Optical properties - Optoelectronic devices - Structural properties - Titanium dioxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Sohn, Hong Yong(h.y.sohn@utah.edu) ",10.1039/c6ra14507h,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: -, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: IIA-1445577, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Utah; Number: 51674129, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51464023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 201408530020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014HA003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported in part by NSF/U.S.-Egypt Joint Science and Technology Board under Grant No. IIA-1445577, National Science Foundation of China (No. 51464023), National Science Foundation of China (No. 51674129) and the Program for Innovative Research Team in Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2014HA003).

"Proc. IEEE Adv. Inf. Manag., Commun., Electron. Autom. Control Conf., IMCEC","How to estimate a macaque's moving finger position through neuron spikes in its mortor cortex is an issue about neural decoding. For the issue, most of existing methods is a supervised training algorithm and require supervised data to obtain the relationship between the spikes and the finger's moving position. Therefore, the performance of the existing methods depends on the training data. This paper proposes an unsupervised decoding method, which is based on a state space model (SSM), adopts neural networks to obtain the weights between the neuron spikes and the finger's moving position, and then estimates the finger's position through sequential state estimator. To reduce computational complexity and enhance estimation accuracy, a nonlinear cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is used to train the neural network and estimate the sequential moving position. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method's advantage is to be unsupervised. It could estimate the finger's position only through the spike vector instead of the supervised training data. Experiment results show that the existing methods have more estimation errors than the proposed method when a small amount of supervised data is adopted, and the exiting ones have similar estimation errors only when more supervised data adopted. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171403535090,7867281,"Xue, Minglong (1); Wu, Haifeng (1); Zeng, Yu (1); Yang, Kai (1) ","(1) School of Electrical and Information Technology, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics,126706.0,"October 3, 2016 - October 5, 2016","Xi'an, China","2016 IEEE Advanced Information Management, Communicates, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IMCEC 2016",Decoding - Information management - Neural networks - State space methods,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Haifeng(whf5469@gmail.com) ",10.1109/IMCEC.2016.7867281,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 2014Z093, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2014HB019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016YJCXS03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61262091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61262091, the Project of Scientific Research Foundation of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education under Grant No. No. 2014Z093, and the 17th batches of Young and Middle-aged Leaders in Academic and Technical Reserved Talents Project of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2014HB019, the Project of Postgraduate Innovation Foundation of Yunnan Minzu University (2016YJCXS03)",9781467396127.0,,,"February 28, 2017",English,Kalman filters,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE Advanced Information Management, Communicates, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IMCEC 2016",6.0,605-609,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE Advanced Information Management, Communicates, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IMCEC 2016",Chongqing Global Union Academy of Science and Technology; Global Union Academy of Science and Technology; IEEE Beijing Section; Xi'an Peihua University,Estimate a macaque's finger trajectory using unsupervised cubature Kalman filtering decoding,,Cubature kalman filters - Estimation errors - Kalman-filtering - Neural decoding - Sequential state - State space model - Supervised training algorithm - Supervised trainings,

Kong Zhi Li Lun Yu Ying Yong,"To address the sluggish parameter estimation and control performance of conventional adaptive control methods, this paper presents a new robust adaptive law based on the parameter estimation error. The information of parameter estimation error is first derived via filter operations, which is used as a new leakage term in the adaptive law design. The proposed adaptive law is further incorporated into the adaptive control system, which can retain exponential convergence of the tracking control error and the parameter estimation simultaneously. Moreover, comparisons to other classical adaptive laws are provided with respect to the parameter estimation convergence and robustness property. A simple and intuitive approach to online test the required persistent excitation (PE) condition is suggested. Simulation and experimental results based on a small 3 DOF-helicopter show that the newly suggested adaptive method can achieve better control and estimation performance than other conventional adaptive schemes. © 2016, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

Nanotechnology,"We report the investigation of exciton dynamics in type-II self-assembled GaSb/GaAs quantum dots. The GaSb/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) were grown using a modified liquid phase epitaxy technique. Statistical size distributions of the uncapped QDs were investigated experimentally by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and theoretically by an eight-band k • calculation, which demonstrated a dissolution effect. Furthermore, the low-temperature luminescence spectra of type-II GaSb/GaAs QDs with a thick capping layer exhibit well-resolved emission bands and LO-phonon-assisted transitions in the GaSb wetting layer. However, the luminescence lines quench at temperatures above 250 K, which is attributed to the weak quantum confinement of electrons participating in indirect exciton recombination. It was demonstrated that the room temperature stability of the excitons in type-II GaSb/GaAs QDs could be achieved by growing thin a capping layer, which provides strong quantum confinement in the conduction band and enhances the electron-hole Coulomb interaction, stabilizing the excitons. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,20160401842054,065602,"Qiu, Feng (1, 2); Qiu, Weiyang (1); Li, Yulian (1); Wang, Xingjun (1); Zhang, Yun (1); Zhou, Xiaohao (1); Lv, Yingfei (1); Sun, Yan (1); Deng, Huiyong (1); Hu, Shuhong (1); Dai, Ning (1, 4, 5); Wang, Chong (2); Yang, Yu (2); Zhuang, Qiandong (3); Hayne, Manus (3); Krier, A.

J Appl Phys,"In this study, we generalize the impulse response approach and Poisson statistics proposed by Smith [Phys. Rev. B 64, 155106 (2001)] to evaluate the longitudinal and transverse magneto-optical conductivities in an electron gas system in Faraday geometry. Comparing with the standard Drude model, the coefficients anare introduced in the Drude-Smith formula to describe the backscattering or localization effect for the nth electronic scattering event. Such a formula can also be applied to study the elements of the dielectric function matrix in the presence of magnetic and radiation fields in electron gas systems. This theoretical work is primely motivated by recent experimental activities in measuring the real and imaginary parts of longitudinal and transverse magneto-optical conductivities in condensed matter materials and electronic devices using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. We believe that the results obtained from this study can provide an appropriate theoretical tool in reproducing the experimental findings and in fitting with experimental data to determine the important sample and material parameters. © 2016 Author(s).",,20162802579637,245706,"Han, F.W.

Nano Energy,"Future solar cells may produce electricity in all weathers. We present here a cost-effective and high-efficiency graphene based conducting composite tailored all-weather solar cell that can be actuated with raindrops and sunlight. Due to the formation of π-electron|cation double-layer pseudocapacitance at conducting composite/raindrop interface, the delocalized π-electrons on graphene can migrate along percolating pathways forward at spreading process and backward at shrinking periods, resulting in charging and discharging of the pseudocapacitor. The optimized solar cell yields a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.8% under simulated sunlight irradiation (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) as well as current over several microamps and voltage of hundreds of microvolts under simulated raindrops.

J. Sep. Sci.,"A novel two-step extraction technique combining ionic-liquid-based dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction with magnetic solid-phase extraction was developed for the preconcentration and separation of aflatoxins in animal feedstuffs before high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection. In this work, ionic liquid 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate was used as the extractant in dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction, and hydrophobic pelargonic acid modified Fe3O4magnetic nanoparticles as an efficient adsorbent were applied to retrieve the aflatoxins-containing ionic liquid. Notably, the target of magnetic nanoparticles was the ionic liquid rather than the aflatoxins. Because of the rapid mass transfer associated with the dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction and magnetic solid phase steps, fast extraction could be achieved. The main parameters affecting the extraction recoveries of aflatoxins were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, vortexing at 2500 rpm for 1 min in the dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction and magnetic solid-phase extraction and then desorption by sonication for 2 min with acetonitrile as eluent. The recoveries were 90.3–103.7% with relative standard deviations of 3.2–6.4%. Good linearity was observed with correlation coefficients ranged from 0.9986 to 0.9995.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Spatial co-location rule mining plays an important role in spatial data mining. The usefulness of co-location rules is strongly limited by the huge amount of discovered rules. To overcome this drawback, several methods were proposed in the literatures. However, being generally based on statistical information, most of these methods do not guarantee that the extracted co-location rules are interesting for the user. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker with an efficient processing step to reduce the number of co-location rules. This demonstration presents OICRM, an interactive system to discover interesting co-location rules based on the ontology. First, the ontology is used to improve the integration of user knowledge; next, a powerful formula sub-system is designed to easily represent domain’s background and constraint knowledge; finally, OICRM has an interactive post-processing step (the secondary mining) to reduce the number of rules furthermore. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20164102893710,,"Bao, Xuguang (1); Wang, Lizhen (1); Wang, Meijiao (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 912.2 Management,,,,,Data mining - Decision making - Ontology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Lizhen(lzhwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-45817-5_67,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by grants (No. 61472346, No. 61262069) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and in part by a grant (No. 2016FA026, No. 2015FB149, and No. 2015FB114) from the Science Foundation of Yunnan Province.",9783319458168.0,03029743,,2016,English,Location,"Web Technologies and Applications - 18th Asia-Pacific Web Conference, APWeb 2016, Proceedings",5.0,570-573,2 of 2,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,OICRM: An ontology-based interesting co-location rule miner,,Decision makers - Interactive system - Ontology-based - Post processing - Processing steps - Spatial data mining - Statistical information - User knowledge,9932 LNCS

Zidonghua Xuebao Acta Auto. Sin.,"Based on priority differentiation and the system efficiency, this paper proposes a station dependent two-level polling system. The mixed service two-level polling system is extended by using queue state-dependent routing, in which only active stations with information packets could be visited by server. The scheme meets the requirement not only for conflict free but also for priority differentiation and efficiency, and provides a lower latency. An embedded Markov chain framework is set up to drive the closed-form expression for the mean waiting time. Numerical examples demonstrate that theoretical and simulation results are identical and the new system has a better efficiency at both key station and normal station.

Phys A Stat Mech Appl,"A novel method for the calculation of DNA sequence similarity is proposed based on simplified pulse-coupled neural network (S-PCNN) and Huffman coding. In this study, we propose a coding method based on Huffman coding, where the triplet code was used as a code bit to transform DNA sequence into numerical sequence. The proposed method uses the firing characters of S-PCNN neurons in DNA sequence to extract features. Besides, the proposed method can deal with different lengths of DNA sequences. First, according to the characteristics of S-PCNN and the DNA primary sequence, the latter is encoded using Huffman coding method, and then using the former, the oscillation time sequence (OTS) of the encoded DNA sequence is extracted. Simultaneously, relevant features are obtained, and finally the similarities or dissimilarities of the DNA sequences are determined by Euclidean distance. In order to verify the accuracy of this method, different data sets were used for testing. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,20162502521967,,"Jin, Xin (1); Nie, Rencan (1); Zhou, Dongming (1); Yao, Shaowen (2); Chen, Yanyan (3); Yu, Jiefu (1); Wang, Quan (1) ","(1) School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",PHYADX,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Codes (symbols) - DNA - Gene encoding - Network coding - Neural networks - Numerical methods,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Dongming(zhoudm@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.physa.2016.05.004,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2012FD003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61365001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61463052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their careful works and valuable suggestions for this study.

Agric. Res.,"This essay provides a physical method to improve the “aging” process of Yunnan Pu’er tea, which is pollution-free, energy saving and having no negative effect on the taste or nutrition facts of Pu’er tea. “Aging” is a special storage method in the culture of Yunnan Pu’er tea. After stored for a certain period of time, the aroma and taste of Pu’er unfermented tea would become favorable for drinkers. In addition, as the elevation of people’s living standard and the gradual acknowledgment of Pu’er tea’s salutary effect, the demand of Pu’er tea increases drastically in recent years. Its characteristic that “getting better” becomes the factor attracting consumer and guiding market price. This essay utilized high-intensity pulsed electric field (HPEF) to process tea samples under different conditions. The results of experiments show that both the taste and aroma of tea samples have improved after the process.

Intl. J. Model. Simul. Sci. Comput.,"It is hard to model a complex system by simply combining its partial characteristics. This paper presents a multi-view collaborative modeling method for complex system. Multi users, multi subjects, multi granularities and multi models in complex system modeling are unified to multi views. The principles and schemes for the decomposition of complex systems are introduced. According to the principle of separation of concerns, a complex system can be decomposed to a variety of model views. Collaborative modeling means that the views can be associated and integrated to form complete system model through their semantic. According to the form of representation, the models are generalizes to three kinds, i.e., view models, semantic models and storage models, which provides a unified framework for conversion and mapping between the models. Under the guidance of the method, a tool for the modeling of warship C2 system is developed.

Comput Math Appl,"Fourth-order compact finite difference scheme has been proposed for solving the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions for some time. An efficient implementation of such numerical scheme is often desired for practical usage. In this paper, based on fast discrete Sine transform, we design an efficient algorithm to implement this scheme. To do this, Poisson equation is first discretized by fourth-order compact finite difference method. The subsequent discretized system is not solved by the usual method - matrix inversion, instead it is solved with the fast discrete Sine transform. By doing this way, the computational cost of proposed algorithm for such scheme with large grid numbers can be greatly reduced. Detailed numerical algorithm of this fast solver for one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three dimensional Poisson equation has been presented. Numerical results in one dimension, two dimensions, three dimensions and four dimensions have shown that the applied compact finite difference scheme has fourth order accuracy and can be efficiently implemented. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Int. Commun. Heat Mass Transf.,"A novel flow arrangement of staggered flow (the fluid staggers flow along each layer) is presented to remove higher heat flux and obtain more uniform bottom temperature in double-layered microchannel heat sinks. Compared to the counter flow, the heat transfer performance of two types of staggered flow is studied numerically. The distribution of the total temperature, average bottom temperature, maximum temperature difference and thermal resistance is presented for different flow arrangements under similar pumping power. The results show that the flow arrangement with staggered flow 2 (the fluid flows along the x direction at the second layer, while fluid staggers along the y direction at the first layer) provides the lowest maximum and most uniform temperature under similar working condition. Moreover, the thermal resistance of staggered flow 2 is much lower than that of counter flow and staggered flow 1 under the similar pumping power, which indicates that it has better cooling capacity for microelectronic cooling. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20164502986206,,"Zhai, Yuling (1); Xia, Guodong (2); Li, Zhouhang (1); Wang, Hua (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing; 100124, China ",IHMTDL,"616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 618.2 Pumps - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer",,,,,Cooling - Cooling systems - Heat flux - Heat resistance - Heat sinks - Microchannels - Microelectronics - Pumps - Temperature - Temperature distribution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhai, Yuling(zhaiyuling00@126.com) ",10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2016.10.008,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 10978193, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51576005, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the Recruitment Program of High-level Talents, Kunming University of Science and Technology (No. 10978193 ), the Recruitment Program of High-level Talents, Kunming University of Science and Technology (No. 10978193 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51576005 ).",,07351933,,"December 1, 2016",English,Flow of fluids,,19.0,98-104,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer,,A novel flow arrangement of staggered flow in double-layered microchannel heat sinks for microelectronic cooling,,Double layered - Double-layered microchannel heat sinks - Heat transfer performance - Maximum temperature differences - Pumping power - Staggered flow - Total temperatures - Uniform temperature,79
Anal. Chim. Acta,"Molecular organic cages as shape-persistent organic molecules with permanent and accessible cavities have attracted a lot of interest because of their importance as host-guest systems. Herein, we report a chiral porous organic cage (POC) CC9 diluted with a polysiloxane OV-1701 to fabricate a CC9-coated capillary column, which was used for the high-resolution gas chromatographic separation of organic compounds, including positional isomers and racemates. On the CC9-coated capillary column, a large number of racemic compounds such as chiral alcohols, esters, ethers and epoxides can be resolved without derivatization. By comparing the chiral recognition ability of the CC9-coated column with the commercially available β-DEX 120 column and the POC CC3-R coated column recently reported by our group, the CC9-coated column offered good resolution during the separation of some racemates, that were not separated using the β-DEX 120 column or POC CC3-R coated column. Therefore, the CC9-coated column can be complementary to the β-DEX 120 column and CC3-R coated column. The results indicated that the CC9-coated column exhibited great potential for application in the separation of positional isomers and enantiomers with great selectivity, high resolution and good reproducibility. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20160601910009,,"Xie, Sheng-Ming (1); Zhang, Jun-Hui (2); Fu, Nan (1); Wang, Bang-Jin (1); Chen, Ling (1); Yuan, Li-Ming (1) ","(1) Department of Chemistry, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Department of Chemistry, East China Normal University, Shanghai; 200241, China ",ACACAM,801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Chirality - Gas chromatography - Isomers - Liquid chromatography - Separation - Silicones - Stereochemistry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yuan, Li-Ming(yuan_limingpd@126.com) ",10.1016/j.aca.2015.11.030,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734324,"Number: 21275126, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21365024, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013FB035, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (No. 21275126 , 21365024 ) and the Y unnan Province's Basic Research  Program (No. 2013FB035 ) of China.

Int. J. Bifurcation Chaos,"This paper is devoted to the study of the problem of rank one strange attractor in a periodically kicked predator-prey system with time-delay. Our discussion is based on the theory of rank one maps formulated by Wang and Young. Firstly, we develop the rank one chaotic theory to delayed systems. It is shown that strange attractors occur when the delayed system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and encounters an external periodic force. Then we use the theory to the periodically kicked predator-prey system with delay, deriving the conditions for Hopf bifurcation and rank one chaos along with the results of numerical simulations. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,20163002640958,1650114,"Yang, Wenjie (1, 2); Lin, Yiping (2); Dai, Yunxian (2); Zhao, Huitao (3) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xuchang University, Xuchang, Henan; 461000, China (2) Department of Applied Mathematics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (3) Department of Mathematics and Information Science, ZhouKou Normal University, ZhouKou; 466001, China ",,454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 713 Electronic Circuits - 713.4 Pulse Circuits - 921 Mathematics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Chaos theory - Dynamical systems - Ecosystems - Hopf bifurcation - Time delay - Timing circuits,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lin, Yiping(linyiping689@163.com) ",10.1142/S0218127416501145,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 11461036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11061016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 11061016, 11461036).",,02181274,7,"June 30, 2016",English,Predator prey systems,,14.0,,,2016,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Ecol. Eng.,"The feasibility of adding straws of ornamental flowers as carbon source into gravel-based biofilters to enhance removals of nitrate and sulfate simultaneously, and the concomitant adverse effects were evaluated in this study. The straws were added into a perforated PVC pipe vertically inserted into each biofilter. Results showed that compared to the control biofilter with almost no removal capacity, the experimental systems effectively co-eliminated nitrate and sulfate from the wastewater, with a mean removal rate of 1.29–2.11 g NO3−-N m−3 d−1and 1.03–2.16 g SO42− m−3 d−1, and higher efficiencies achieved for carnation and lily straws than rose and violet. A significant positive correlation was detected between nitrate and sulfate removal efficiency, with the nitrate removal notably more efficient. Nitrate and sulfate removal rates both decreased gradually with the operation time due to the declining carbon supply, and could be augmented again by fresh straw addition even in winter season. The phosphorous removal capacity of the biofilter was low and just influenced limitedly by the straw addition. High contents of organic carbon and colored matter were determined in the effluent after the straw addition but sharp drops to low levels were followed, resulting in insufficient carbon source for the removals of nitrate and sulfate. Mild accumulations of nitrite and ammonium occurred, averaging 0.39–1.30 mg L−1and 0.46–0.93 mg L−1in the effluent, while the content of dissolved sulfide was low. The biofilter added with rose straw showed the lowest relative adverse effects despite of its low removal capacities, and good performance with moderate adverse effects were obtained when adding with the carnation straw. The biofilter can be potentially applied to co-alleviate nitrate and sulfate pollutions although further optimization of straw addition is still required. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162802572072,,"Chang, Jun-jun (1); Lu, Yi-Feng (1); Chen, Jin-quan (1); Wang, Xiao-yun (2); Luo, Tong (1); Liu, Hu (1) ","(1) School of Ecology and Environmental Science, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Kunming Landscape Planning and Design Institute, Kunming; 650031, China ",ECENEL,452.3 Industrial Wastes - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Biofilters - Efficiency - Effluents - Gravel - Nitrates - Organic carbon - Polyvinyl chlorides - Sulfur compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Jin-quan(aidun0408@163.com) ",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.06.032,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 201401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012ZX07302-002-10, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013FD006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51408531, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51408532, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China [ 51408531 , 51408532 ], Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment ( 2012ZX07302-002-10 ), Project of Science and Technology Program of Yunnan Province , China ( 2013FD006 ), and the Special Project of Science and Technology Program of Chenggong District of Kunming City , China [ 201401 ].",,09258574,,"October 1, 2016",English,Nitrogen removal,,40.0,189-197,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Ecological Engineering,,Simultaneous removals of nitrate and sulfate and the adverse effects of gravel-based biofilters with flower straws added as exogenous carbon source,,Adverse effect - Experimental system - Nitrate removal - Phosphorous removal - Positive correlations - Simultaneous removal - Sulfate removal - Sulfate removal rate,95
Beijing Ligong Daxue Xuebao,"In order to explore the mechanism of the influence of family members' activity arrangements on the decision-making of car use, based on the survey data of residents travel in Qujing in 2015, combined with activity-based analysis and time geography, six models of car use wereput forward, and also established decision making process model for family car use. The results show that the temporal-spatial constraint of family members is the key factors to determine the car allocation, because members who participate in subsistence activities prefer to get priority to the use of cars, but in the subsistence activity, female are easy to form car dependent; the activities of members of the arrangement will further affect the distribution of the right to use cars, the male's activities arrangement have more influence on female to use cars, and transfer the right of car use. © 2016, Editorial Department of Transaction of Beijing Institute of Technology.

Ecohydrology,"Fog is an important supplemental source of water in regions with heavy fog and little rainfall. In the present study, we used the stable isotope content of xylem water to investigate the dry season water source partition between soil and fog water of two evergreen tree species (Cleistanthus sumatranus and Lasiococca comberi), two deciduous tree species (Mayodendron igneum and Lagerstroemia tomentosa), two liana species (Acacia pennata and Combretum latifolium) and understory seedlings of three tree species (C. sumatranus, L. comberi and Celtis philippensis) in a tropical karst forest in southern Yunnan, China. The soil gravimetric water content (GWC) and volumetric water content (VWC), pre-dawn leaf water potential (Ψpre-dawn) and leaf water absorbance were also measured. There were no significant differences in both GWC and VWC among 10 to 100 cm depths in the dry season. In the dry season 2009, Ψpre-dawnof the two evergreen tree species and the understory seedlings down to −4.5 to −6.3 MPa, and which were significantly lower than those of a normal dry season. The proportion that fog contributed to xylem water ranged from 15.8% (understory seedling of C. sumatranus) to 41.3% (liana species C. latifolium). After immersing in water for 3 h, leaves of all the studied species absorbed a significant volume of water. Our results reveal that the woody plants in the tropical karst forest of Xishuangbanna use fog water as an important supplement in the dry season, with more fog water being used by lianas than by trees.

Mater. Sci. Eng. C,"Polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA, was used as a stabilizer and linker for functionalized TiO2nanotubes (TiO2NTs). Self-assembled process with palladium nanoparticles (NPs) was successfully synthesized and used for the oxidation of glucose on glassy carbon electrodes. Based on the voltammetric and amperometric results, Pd NPs efficiently catalyzed the oxidation of glucose at - 0.05 V in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl and showed excellent resistance toward interference poisoning from such interfering species as ascorbic acid, uric acid and urea. To further increase sensitivity, the Pd NPs-PDDA-TiO2NTs/GCE was electrochemically treated with H2SO4and NaOH, the glucose oxidation current was magnified 2.5 times than that before pretreatments due to greatly enhancing the electron transport property of the sensor based on the increased defect sites and surface oxide species. In view of the physiological level of glucose, the wide linear concentration range of glucose (4 × 10- 7-8 × 10- 4M) with a detection limit of 8 × 10- 8M (S/N = 3) was obviously good enough for clinical application. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Water Sci. Technol.,"The effects of Fe(III) on the biofilm mass and activity, the biofilm micromorphology as well as the composition and functional groups characteristics of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilm were investigated in laboratory-scale fixed bed biofilm reactors. The results showed that 2 mg/L of Fe(III) promoted the biofilm mass and improved the biofilm activity, but 16 mg/L of Fe(III) adversely affected biofilm development. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study indicated a high concentration (16 mg/L) of Fe(III) led to significant reduction of the filaments, great promotion of the EPS secretion in biofilm. The result of the EPS composition suggested 2 mg/L of Fe(III) increased soluble EPS and loosely bound EPS which contributed to the microbial aggregation, while 16 mg/L of Fe(III) promoted tightly bound EPS production unfavourable for substrate mass transfer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that Fe(III) exerted a significant influence on the-CONH-groups of proteins and the C-O groups of polysaccharides in EPS. This study reveals that Fe(III) influences biofilm development and activity not only by directly impacting the microbial physiology but by indirectly affecting the EPS constituents, and it helps to provide theoretical guidance for iron ion containing wastewater treatment. © 2016 WA Publishing.",,20162102405534,,"Hu, Xuewei (1); Chen, Kai (1); Lai, Xinke (1); Ji, Siping (2); Kaiser, Kevin (3) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (3) Institute for Applied Material Flow Management, University of Applied Sciences Trier, PO Box 1380, Birkenfeld; D-55761, Germany ",WSTED4,445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 461.8 Biotechnology - 461.9 Biology - 462.5 Biomaterials (including synthetics) - 531.1 Metallurgy - 641.3 Mass Transfer - 801 Chemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 815.1 Polymeric Materials,,,,,Biofilms - Bioreactors - Chemicals removal (water treatment) - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Iron removal (water treatment) - Mass transfer - Metal ions - Physiology - Polymers - Scanning electron microscopy - Substrates - Wastewater treatment - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hu, Xuewei(huxuewei.env@gmail.com) ",10.2166/wst.2016.042,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013Z123, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015Z118, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51178208, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51368024, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51178208, 51368024) and the Key Projects in Yunnan Province Department of Education (2013Z123, 2015Z118).",,02731223,9,May 2016,English,Iron compounds,,27.0,2060-2066,,2016,"IWA Publishing, 12 Caxton Street, London, SW1H 0QS, United Kingdom",Water Science and Technology,,Effects of Fe(III) on biofilm and its extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in fixed bed biofilm reactors,,Biofilm activity - Biofilm development - Bound EPS - Extracellular polymeric substances - Fixed bed biofilm reactors - Iron ions - Microbial physiology - Micromorphologies,73
Tectonophysics,"We used teleseismic data recorded by a permanent seismic network in Yunnan, SE Tibet, and measured the interstation Rayleigh wave phase velocity between 10 and 60 s. A two-step inversion scheme was used to invert for the 3D S-wave velocity and azimuthal anisotropy structure of 10–110 km. The results show that there are two low velocity channels between depths of 20–30 km in Yunnan and that the fast axes are sub-parallel to the strikes of the low velocity channels, which supports the crustal flow model. The azimuthal anisotropy pattern is quite complicated and reveals a complex crust–mantle coupling mechanism in Yunnan. The N–S trending Lüzhijiang Fault separates the Dianzhong Block into two parts. In the western Dianzhong Block, the fast axis of the S-wave changes with depth, which indicates that the crust and the lithospheric mantle are decoupled. In the eastern Dianzhong Block and the western Yangtze Craton, the crust and the lithospheric mantle may be decoupled because of crustal flow, despite a coherent S-wave fast axis at depths of 10–110 km. In addition, the difference between the S-wave fast axis in the lithosphere and the SKS splitting measurement suggests that the lithosphere and the upper mantle are decoupled there. In the Baoshan Block, the stratified anisotropic pattern suggests that the crust and the upper mantle are decoupled. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20164202926185,,"Chen, Haopeng (1, 2); Zhu, Liangbao (2, 3); Su, Youjin (4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Geodesy and Earth's Dynamics, Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan; 430077, China (2) Department of Geophysics, School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan; 430079, China (3) Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment and Geodesy, Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan; 430079, China (4) Earthquake Administration of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650224, China ",,"751.1 Acoustic Waves - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Acoustic wave velocity - Anisotropy - Surface waves - Wave propagation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Liangbao(lbzhu@sgg.whu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.tecto.2016.07.007,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2015M582311, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 15-01-01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41374053, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41374053 ), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2015M582311 ), and the Surveying and Mapping Basic Research Program of National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation ( 15-01-01 ).

Commun. Stat. Simul. Comput.,"In genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to detect the disease-associated genetic variants, two-stage design has received much attention because of its cost effectiveness and high efficiency. Under the framework of a two-stage design, it has been shown that joint analysis is more powerful than replication-based analysis. Several robust tests have been proposed for joint analysis to handle the problem of unknown genetic mode of inheritance. However, existing joint analysis of combining test statistics from both stages might suffer from a loss of efficiency if the combined test statistics are not sufficient or the weight of the statistic for each stage is not appropriate. In this article, we propose a new strategy for joint analysis by combining the raw data rather than the test statistics across stages and construct a robust MAX3-based test for two-staged GWASs, which can make full use of the information of the data from both stages. Our numerical results show that the proposed procedure is more powerful and computationally much faster than the existing joint analysis procedures. An application to a type 2 diabetes dataset is used to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,20162602536712,,"Pan, Dong-Dong (1); Li, Zheng-Bang (2); Li, Qi-Zhai (3); Kam Fung, Wing (4) ","(1) Department of Statistics, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China (3) Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (4) Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong ",,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 913.1 Production Engineering - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Cost effectiveness - Data fusion - Efficiency - Genes - Statistical tests - Uncertainty analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Kam Fung, Wing(wingfung@hku.hk) ",10.1080/03610918.2014.901360,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15324141,,,,03610918,7,"August 8, 2016",English,Statistics,,29.0,2362-2376,,2016,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Communications in Statistics: Simulation and Computation,,A Novel Powerful Joint Analysis with Data Fusion in Two-stage Case–Control Genome-wide Association Studies,,Genetic models - GWAS - MAX3 - Power - Two stage designs,45

J Mater Res,"Herein, Cu and Cu-Ge alloys with different stacking fault energies (SFEs) are prepared via rolling at room temperature (RTR) and via a combination of high-pressure torsion (HPT) and RTR (HPT + RTR). The x-ray diffraction measurements reveal that the grain size, dislocation density, and twin density vary with the strain and SFEs. The tensile tests indicate that the strength of materials with medium SFEs increases initially and then slightly declines, while the ductility is enhanced by increasing the strain via HPT. In contrast, for low-SFE materials, enhanced strength and improved ductility may be achieved simultaneously through increasing the strain to a high level. The variation of strength with respect to strain is primarily dependent on the solute concentration and SFE. The underlying mechanisms governing the effect of strain and SFE on the microstructures and mechanical properties of the metals are also discussed. © Materials Research Society 2016.",,20161602270100,,"Gong, Y.L.

Jiaotong Yunshu Gongcheng Xuebao,"In actual road network, the optimization model on tractor-and-trailer transportation scheduling with uncertain empty-trailer tasks was built. A two-stage heuristic algorithm was designed to solve the model. At the first stage, the transportation scheme of empty-trailer task was decided by two strategies, minimizing the transportation distance of empty-trailer and minimizing the total surplus of origin destination (OD) points for heavy-trailer tasks respectively. At the second stage, the task node surplus and the greed thought were combined to determine the execution sequence of all tasks. Numerical examples were used to analyze the performance of the algorithm. Analysis result shows that empty-trailer transportation cost and total cost are 325.5 and 1 010.5 yuan respectively, which respectively save by 10.44% and 3.62% compared to the original scheme, and less tractors are used. Based on the numerical example of tractor-and-trailer transportation among cities in Liaoning Province, the optimal values under two strategies, minimizing the transportation distance of empty-trailer and minimizing the total surplus of OD points for heavy-trailer tasks are 2 561.3 and 2 464.6 yuan respectively, average solving times are 21.5 and 27.3 s respectively, and the results under the second strategy have good stability. The total costs computed by using simulated annealing algorithm are all above 3 100 yuan, and the solving times are all above 80 s. So, the algorithm in this paper has higher precision and efficiency, and the strategy of minimizing total surplus of OD points for heavy-trailer tasks has obvious advantages on tractor-and-trailer transportation scheduling problem with uncertain empty-trailer tasks. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

Sci. Total Environ.,"The90Sr activity concentrations released from a radioactive fallout have been determined in a range of samples of mushrooms collected in Poland, Belarus, China, and Sweden in 1996-2013. Measurement of90Sr in pooled samples of mushrooms was carried out with radiochemical procedure aimed to pre-isolate the analyte from the fungal materials before it was determined using the Low-Level Beta Counter. Interestingly, the Purple Bolete Imperator rhodopurpureus collected from Yunnan in south-western China in 2012 showed90Sr activity concentration at around 10Bqkg-1dry biomass, which was greater when compared to other mushrooms in this study. The King Bolete Boletus edulis from China showed the90Sr activity in caps at around 1.5Bqkg-1dry biomass (whole fruiting bodies) in 2012 and for specimens from Poland activity was well lower than 1.0Bqkg-1dry biomass in 1998-2010.

Binggong Xuebao,"A coordinate system for wave-driven underwater vehicle is defined based on multi-body system dynamics theory. The kinematics analysis of the whole system is performed by choosing the appropriate generalized coordinates, while the velocities and acceleration are deduced, and the expressions of partial velocities and partial angular velocities are deduced based on Kane's method according to the dynamic analysis of the whole system. The generalized inertial force and generalized active force of the whole system are calculated. A multi-body system dynamics model of wave-driven underwater vehicle is established by taking the calculated results into the Kane's equations. The force analysis of the proposed model focuses on the wave force and the additional mass force of multi-body system besides inertia force, inertia moment, gravity, buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces.

Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao,"The Mn-Zn ferrite powder compact is heated by microwave with a frequency of 2.45 GHz. This essay illustrates the micro-mechanism of the interaction between microwave field and dielectric, elucidates the mechanism of soft-magnetic ferrite electromagnetic loss in microwave field, and discusses the characteristics of Mn-Zn ferrite powder compact when heated by microwave, as well as some factors such as microwave field E, dielectric constant Εr, permeability μi, etc, which influence the heating temperature. Mn-Zn ferrite is a magnetic mixed media, and the basic reason for Mn-Zn ferrite powder compacts can be heated in microwave field is that the microwave electromagnetic energy can convert into heat along with energy loss. The energy loss mainly includes dielectric loss and magnetic loss, and the main factors influence the energy loss are microwave electromagnetic field intensity and its frequency. In a particular microwave field (2.45 GHz), the power of the microwave is the main influence factor of the sintering temperature, when the power of microwave changes, it leads to the change of the heating sintering curve. The material influence factors of the energy loss for Mn-Zn ferrite are permittivity Εrand permeability μi, both chang with temperature, and frequency. © 2016 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",Open Access,20164102899116,,"Zhang, Jiamin (1, 2, 3, 4); Yi, Jianhong (1, 2, 3, 4); Gan, Guoyou (1, 2, 3, 4); Liu, Yichun (1, 2, 3, 4); Bao, Rui (1, 2, 3, 4); Du, Jinghong (1, 2, 3, 4); Yan, Jikang (1, 2, 3, 4); You, Xin (1, 2, 3, 4); Tan, Songlin (1, 2, 3, 4) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials in Rare & Precious and Nonferrous Metals of Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (4) Kunming Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials in Rare & Precious and Nonferrous Metals, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",CHHKA2,525.4 Energy Losses (industrial and residential) - 531.2 Metallography - 543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 701 Electricity and Magnetism - 708.1 Dielectric Materials - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media,,,,,Binary alloys - Dielectric losses - Electromagnetic fields - Electromagnetic waves - Energy dissipation - Ferrite - Manganese alloys - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Powders - Sintering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yi, Jianhong(yijianhong@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.3901/JME.2016.18.051,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,05776686,18,"September 20, 2016",Chinese,Zinc alloys,,18.0,51-56,,2016,Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering,Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering,,Mechanism and characteristics of Mn-Zn ferrite powder compacts heated by microwave,,Electromagnetic loss - Heating temperatures - Micro mechanisms - Microwave electromagnetic field - Microwave field - Mn-Zn ferrite powder - Mn-Zn ferrites - Sintering temperatures,52

Wood Fiber Sci,"Windmill palm leaf sheath fiber (WPF) is an abundant agricultural byproduct and useful resource. To increase its valuable qualities and usefulness, we proposed to prepare WPF powder-based activated carbon (WPFAC) as a novel adsorbent for adsorbing methylene blue, with the specific aims for pollution treatment. The porous features of WPFAC were assessed based on nitrogen adsorption, and the adsorption capacity was studied by investigating the effect parameters of contact time, initial concentration, pH, and temperature. Research results showed a combination microporous and mesoporous structure of WPFAC with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface of 1049.26 m2/g. WPFAC exhibited excellent adsorbing performance, and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was up to 51.78 times higher than other absorbents. Meanwhile, the adsorption capacity increased accordingly as the parameters increased. For better understanding, the adsorption behavior, isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics were studied using the equilibrium data. Investigation results illustrated that the equilibrium data were well consistent with the Langmuir isotherm, with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 253.16, 289.85, and 303.95 mg/g at 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C, respectively. The adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters: standard enthalpy (ΔH0), standard entropy (ΔS0), and standard free energy (ΔG0) indicated an endothermic and spontaneous absorbing process.

The results indicated that the different oxidant species has an important effect on the morphology and structure of PSP. In stain etching, there is still a challenge for fabricating PSP with uniform and controlled pore size structure. In contrast, metal-assisted chemical etching method is easier to prepare PSPs sample with uniform depth and pore size than stain etching, In 1-MACE, the growth rate of the PSPs pore was between 0.05 and 0.10 μm/min, which is far less than that of 2-MACE (about 0.2~0.5 μm/min).

First calculation model and load values were introduced. Then the ice jump law and wind deviation law under ice-shedding load and wind load joint action were studied, and the midpoint maximum vertical displacement of ice-shedding span at ice-shedding load and wind load was gotten simultaneously. The wind load less affected on ice jump height was reached. But maximum horizontal amplitude occurs prior wind action then ice-shedding action conditions and ice-shedding time should be when maximum horizontal displacement occurs, moreover the maximum horizontal amplitude of conductor has increased significantly under fluctuating wind. Finally horizontal amplitude of conductor at different parameters was studied. And the horizontal amplitude simplified formula of conductor after ice shedding can be invoked as line and tower design. © 2016, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

J Thermoplast Compos Mater,The surface treatment of poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fiber is to improve the interfacial adhesion of the PBO fiber-reinforced high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composite. The surface characteristics of untreated and treated PBO fiber were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The interfacial shear strength between HDPE and PBO fiber was analyzed by measuring three-point bending properties of the composite. TPB exhibited different results due to the PBO fiber surface treatment. The results showed that the treatment of PBO fiber improved the interfacial adhesion as compared to the untreated one. The effects of PBO fiber content on tribological properties of the HDPE composites were investigated. The worn surface morphologies of HDPE composites were examined by scanning electron microscopy and the wear mechanisms were discussed. Results show that all treated PBO/HDPE have superior tribological characteristics to unfilled ones. © The Author(s) 2014.,,20163002633586,,"Li, Jia (1); Li, Sha (1); Ye, Tao (1); Di, Yang (1, 2); Jianguo, Zhang (3) ","(1) Information School, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China (2) Faculty of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China (3) School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai, China ",JTMAEQ,801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Adhesion - Aromatic compounds - Fibers - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Interfaces (materials) - Reinforcement - Scanning electron microscopy - Surface treatment - Tribology - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ye, Tao ",10.1177/0892705714556831,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15307980,,,,08927057,8,"August 1, 2016",English,High density polyethylenes,,12.0,1064-1074,,2016,SAGE Publications Ltd,Journal of Thermoplastic Composite Materials,,The three-point bending and tribological properties of surface-treated poly(p -phenylene benzobisoxazole) fiber-reinforced high-density polyethylene composite,,Interfacial adhesions - Interfacial shear strength - PBO fibers - Poly(p phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) - Poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers - Surface characteristics - Tribological characteristics - Worn surface morphology,29
Huazhong Ligong Daxue Xuebao,"Due to the small inter-phase distance of compact overhead transmission line, inter-phase flashover and collision easily occur. In order to solve this problem, finite element model of compact overhead transmission line was built, and the influence of some factors (such as span, hanging point elevation, wire tension and wind speed) on windage yaw of compact overhead transmission line was studied. A simplified formula for calculating the minimum inter-phase distance was proposed. Also, the controlling effect on windage yaw with various inter-phase spacer layout positions and methods was analyzed. Several suggestions for preventing windage yaw of compact overhead transmission line were presented. Using the parametric finite element method, the software for calculating windage yaw of compact overhead transmission line was developed based on VC++ and ANSYS. This software improves the efficiency of windage yaw calculation, providing references for the transmission lines design and safety evaluation. © 2016, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Appl Therm Eng,"In this paper, a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology was adopted to investigate the characteristics of oxy-coal combustion in a cement kiln with a specially designed burner. The simulation was conducted under five oxidant stream conditions with different O2/N2volume ratios: 21/79, 24/76, 27/73, 30/70, and 33/67. The results revealed that there is strong entrainment from the primary air to the secondary air, resulting in an inner recirculation zone and outside recirculation zone. The oxygen-enriched combustion increases the maximum temperature and improves the combustion efficiency; however, the uniformity of the temperature field becomes worse. The temperature rises sharply as the oxygen content increases; however, the enhancement is slight when the oxygen content exceeds 30%. At a lower oxygen content ( © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J. Therm. Sci. Technol.,"A stabilized composite phase change material for heat storage was synthesized by adding expanded graphite and disodium hydrogen phosphate to sodium acetate trihydrate with the method of vacuum adsorption. The effects of expanded graphite and disodium hydrogen phosphate were experimentally explored and the thermal properties of the composite material were characterized. The experimental results indicated that disodium hydrogen phosphate was an excellent nucleating agent for sodium acetate trihydrate. With addition of 1% disodium hydrogen phosphate, the supercooling degree of sodium acetate trihydrate decreased significantly from over 38°C to about 0.5°C. The addition of expanded graphite was also helpful to ameliorate supercooling of sodium acetate trihydrate. Furthermore, phase separation of sodium acetate trihydrate could be effectively eliminated by adding expanded graphite. Compared with the disodium hydrogen phosphate/sodium acetate trihydrate composite material (without addition of expanded graphite), the heat storage/release time of the expanded graphite/disodium hydrogen phosphate/sodium acetate trihydrate composite material was shorten by 75.3%. With the optimal ingredient proportion of 8% expanded graphite, 1% disodium hydrogen phosphate and 91% sodium acetate trihydrate, the composite material became a stabilized 'solid-solid' phase change energy storage material with excellent thermal performance. Its thermal conductivity was greatly improved, and the phase change latent heat reached 233.5kJ/kg.

Int. J. Heat Mass Transf.,"Flow boiling heat transfer of water in a thermosyphon loop based natural circulation solar steam generation system with a horizontally-arranged receiver towards parabolic trough collector (PTC) applications was studied experimentally. The diameter ratio (Rd) of the receiver was varied over a range from 1.0 to 2.0 to explore its effect on flow boiling heat transfer, especially the stratified flow boiling characteristics in the receiver tube, and thermal performance of the thermosyphon system. The results show that flow boiling heat transfer in the receiver was improved since Rd was increased to 1.2 due to a flow pattern transition which eliminated the effect of gas-liquid stratification on surface wettability deterioration in the receiver. An optimal tube diameter ratio was found to be 1.4 with a heat transfer coefficient enhancement by 12.2% in comparison to the baseline case. Simultaneously, the rise of Rd resulted in an enhancement of backflow in the inlet of receiver. The effect of backflow on isothermal improvement in the falling tube of thermosyphon, however, was found to be irrelevant to the total heat pipe thermal resistance (RHP). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Light Met. 2016,"A pilot test of an aluminum electrolysis was completed in the year of 2014 using inert anodes with the composition NiFe2O4-M (M is metal). The volume of the cell is 110 × 66 × 79 cm, the size of inert anode is 034 φ34 × H22 cm, the total number of inert anodes in the cell are six, the current density of the inert anode is about 0.8 A/cm2, the total electrolysis current fluctuates from 2700 to 4000 A, the electrolysis duration time is 500 hours. The result of the pilot test indicated that the electrolysis process can be run successfully, since above inert anodes have better electric conductivity and corrosive resistance. In addition, none of the six inert anodes cracked during the whole electrolysis process even at the beginning of electrolysis when they were inserted in high temperature electrolyte.

MATEC Web Conf.,"A La-modified clinoptilolite adsorbent was developed for phosphorus removal from aqueous solution. The effects of operational parameters such as pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time and temperature on phosphorus adsorption were investigated. The results showed that the phosphorus removal ratio of modified clinoptilolite (99.45%) was significantly improved, which was over triple than that of natural ones (31.50%) under optimum conditions. The adsorption process was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Moreover, the adsorption data closely fitted the Freundlich isotherm model. The proper pH for phosphorus removal ranged from 5 to 8. The adsorption process was appeared to be controlled by chemical precipitation. The mechanism might involve ion complexation during subsequent adsorption of phosphorus on lanthanum hydroxides. It cost modified clinoptilolite less time to reach equilibrium. The application of modified clinoptilolite is available in wastewater treatment. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2016.",Open Access,20163402727115,07013,"Tu, Can (1); Wang, Shibo (1); Qiu, Weixia (1); Xie, Ruosong (1); Hu, Bocai (1); Qu, Guangfei (1); Ning, Ping (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",,452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,123077.0,"August 20, 2016 - August 21, 2016","Chiang Mai, Thailand","International Symposium on Materials Application and Engineering, SMAE 2016",Lanthanum compounds - Precipitation (chemical) - Solutions - Wastewater treatment - Zeolites,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Qu, Guangfei(qgflab@sina.com) ",10.1051/matecconf/20166707013,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),2261236X,,,,,,"July 29, 2016",English,Adsorption,"International Symposium on Materials Application and Engineering, SMAE 2016",35.0,,1of1,2016,EDP Sciences,MATEC Web of Conferences,,Phosphorus Removal from Aqueous Solution by Adsorption onto La-modified Clinoptilolite,,Adsorption process - Chemical precipitation - Freundlich isotherm model - Lanthanum hydroxide - Modified clinoptilolite - Operational parameters - Phosphorus adsorption - Pseudo-second-order kinetic models,67

"Proc. - Int. Conf. Netw. Netw. Appl., NaNA","Node localization is of significant importance for supporting many critical applications in wireless sensor networks. However, traditional Amorphous localization algorithm and its variants still cannot provide sufficient localization accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved Amorphous localization algorithm to determine the locations of unknown nodes. To determine the locations of unknown nodes under this algorithm, we need to select these beacon nodes, which are less than a presetting hop count threshold away from unknown nodes. We then adopt two-dimensional hyperbolic function instead of the classic least square method to determine the locations of unknown nodes, which are very close to their actual locations. Simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of our proposed localization algorithm in wireless sensor networks. Remarkably, the average localization error of our proposed localization algorithm is lower than those of Amorphous algorithm and its improved algorithm, under both the uniform and non-uniform node distributions. © 2016 IEEE.",,20164202921127,7564115,"Shen, Shikai (1, 2); Yang, Bin (3); Qian, Kaiguo (4); Wang, Wu (1, 2); Jiang, Xiaohong (1); She, Yumei (5); Wang, Yujian (2) ","(1) School of Systems Information Science, Future University Hakodate, Hokkaido; 041-8655, Japan (2) School of Information and Technology, Kunming University, Kunming; 650214, China (3) School of Computer and Information Engineering, Chuzhou University, Chuzhou; 239000, China (4) Department of Physics Science and Technology, Kunming University, Kunming; 650214, China (5) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650031, China ",,"722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 722.3 Data Communication, Equipment and Techniques - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods",123744.0,"July 23, 2016 - July 25, 2016","Hakodate City, Hokkaido, Japan","2016 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications, NaNA 2016",Hyperbolic functions - Least squares approximations - Location - Wireless sensor networks,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shen, Shikai(kmssk2000@sina.com) ",10.1109/NaNA.2016.76,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467398039.0,,,"September 9, 2016",English,Sensor nodes,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications, NaNA 2016",13.0,69-72,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications, NaNA 2016",,An improved amorphous localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks,,Beacon nodes - Critical applications - Least square methods - Localization accuracy - Localization algorithm - Localization errors - Node localization - Non-uniform node distributions,
J Electroanal Chem,"A high sensitive electrochemical signal transduction amplification strategy was constructed based on the integration of the target-triggered silver deposition and the high sensitive stripping voltammetry detection. The Au-nanoparticles (AuNPs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified glassy carbon electrode (AuNPs/MWNTs/PEI/GCE) was prepared and used as the working electrode which could also amplify the electrochemical signal dramatically due to the excellent electronic property of the electrode and the Au-nanoparticles induced silver deposition reaction. This strategy was applied to the high sensitive ascorbic acid (AA) determination and a detection limit as low as 15 fM was achieved, which was 6–9 orders of magnitude more sensitive than other reported methods for AA determination. The proposed method has good selectivity and anti-interference ability, which could be applied to AA detection in real complex samples. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20164102891483,,"Li, Xiang (1); Zhou, Chuan-Hua (1); Zi, Qin-jiang (1); Cao, Qiu-E (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource (Ministry of Education), Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",JECHES,461.9 Biology - 704.1 Electric Components - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 819.4 Fiber Products - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Amplification - Bacteriophages - Chemical detection - Deposition - Electronic properties - Glass membrane electrodes - Gold nanoparticles - Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN) - Nanoparticles - Signal transduction - Yarn,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Chuan-Hua(chzhou@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jelechem.2016.09.038,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: W4030002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015FD002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21505119, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21465025, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21465025, 21505119), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2015FD002), the Postdoctoral's Foundation of Yunnan University (W4030002).",,15726657,,"November 1, 2016",English,Ascorbic acid,,32.0,321-326,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry,,An electrochemical signal transduction amplification strategy for ultrasensitive detection of ascorbic acid,,Amplification strategy - ELectrochemical detection - Electrochemical signals - Modified glassy carbon electrode - Signal amplifications - Silver deposition - Stripping voltammetry - Ultrasensitive detection,780
Knowl Based Syst,"Granule description is a fundamental problem in granular computing. Although the spirit of granular computing has been widely adopted in scientific researches, how to classify and describe granules in a concise and apt way is still an open, interesting and important problem. The main objective of our paper is to give a solution to this problem under the framework of granular computing. Firstly, by using stability index, we classify the granules into three categories: atomic granules, basic granules and composite granules. Secondly, in order to improve the conciseness and aptness of granules, we impose additional conditions on minimal generator to define a new term which is called the most apt minimal generator. And then, based on the most apt minimal generator, we put forward methods for the description of atomic granules and basic granules. Moreover, for composite granules, we continue to divide them into three subcategories: ∧-definable granules, (∧, ¬)-definable granules and (∧, ∨)-definable granules, and their respective descriptions are provided as well. Finally, some discussions are also made on indefinable granules. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Risk Anal.,"A key justification to support plant health regulations is the ability of quarantine services to conduct pest risk analyses (PRA). Despite the supranational nature of biological invasions and the close proximity and connectivity of Southeast Asian countries, PRAs are conducted at the national level. Furthermore, some countries have limited experience in the development of PRAs, which may result in inadequate phytosanitary responses that put their plant resources at risk to pests vectored via international trade. We review existing decision support schemes for PRAs and, following international standards for phytosanitary measures, propose new methods that adapt existing practices to suit the unique characteristics of Southeast Asia. Using a formal written expert elicitation survey, a panel of regional scientific experts was asked to identify and rate unique traits of Southeast Asia with respect to PRA. Subsequently, an expert elicitation workshop with plant protection officials was conducted to verify the potential applicability of the developed methods. Rich biodiversity, shortage of trained personnel, social vulnerability, tropical climate, agriculture-dependent economies, high rates of land-use change, and difficulties in implementing risk management options were identified as challenging Southeast Asian traits. The developed methods emphasize local Southeast Asian conditions and could help support authorities responsible for carrying out PRAs within the region. These methods could also facilitate the creation of other PRA schemes in low- and middle-income tropical countries. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis.",,20162102421383,,"Soliman, T. (1); Macleod, A.

Zongguo Gonglu Xuebao,"Taking construction of Funing-Longliu Expressway under high and steep rocky slope condition as an example, the disadvantages of deep cutting were analyzed, then modified column shed-tunnel scheme was proposed and successfully implemented. For implementation of the full section excavation, based on the analysis of the slope stability, the finite element method was used to simulate the stress and deformation of rock mass, considering the condition with combined supporting and without combined supporting (the combination of micro inclined anchor pile, anchor bolt and shotcrete) in half-underground section. Based on quantitative analysis of the effects of combined supporting, the maximum displacement caused by gravitational-stress field under half-underground section excavation is about 2.1 mm. The effect of combined supporting on the decrease of displacement is insignificant, while internal stress in part of the surrounding rock region is increased, and the stress concentration inside surrounding rock of side wall is intensified. This indicates that the effect of combined supporting on the prevention of stratum deformation and improvement of stress condition under high and steep rocky slope with good integrity and uniformity is not obvious. The results show that it is feasible to adopt shed-tunnel scheme first for Funing-Longliu expressway under the high and steep rocky slope condition, and the combined supporting pattern of micro inclined anchor pile and bolt and shotcrete can be improved according to situations during the shed-tunnel construction. © 2016, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Landslides Eng. Slopes. Exp. Theory Pract.,"The engineered excavation in mountainous areas for land reclamation is creating numerous single-staged high embankment slopes (height 40 ∼ 50 m) on the hilly loess areas in China. With an increasing amount of failures of loess slopes to be found in major cities, embankment slopes can pose great risk to the local community and cause damages to the properties in the surrounding areas. In this article a case study disclosed a complete failure process of a high fill slope (max. height > 40 m) although it had strengthened by a combining technique of reinforced retaining walls with anchor piles. The deformation of the retaining structures ensued from the loading imposed by the construction, with cracks formed at the bottom of the pile board and retrogressed upwards. The proportion of the cracks with opening exceeding 3 mm increased with the progress of the backfill. The deformation process of the hillslope was recorded by the IBIS-L terrain deformation monitoring system at resolution of 0.1 mm. The deformation process can be divided into three phases, i.e. creep - slip - collapse, to respond to the deformation development at different stages. The instability criterion is proposed by analyzing the results of deformation characteristics of the hill slope. It indicates that the slope failure will occurs in case the slip surface be formed at s tangent angle > 75° on the deformation curve with rapid rise of acceleration from 0 mm/h2to 8.9 mm/h2. © 2016 Associazione Geotecnica Italiana, Rome, Italy.",,20163602778392,,"Pei, X.J.

Adding the nucleating agent K2SO4, CaSO4·2H2O, Na4P2O7·10H2O and enhance heat transfer material expanded graphite(EG) could improve the performance, EG/Na2S2O3·5H2O phase change energy storage composite with stable properties was prepared. Test results show that the nucleation performance of K2SO4for Na2S2O3·5H2O is worse, both CaSO4·2H2O and Na4P2O7·10H2O have better nucleation performance, which could significantly reduce the undercooling degree of Na2S2O3·5H2O. However, the CaSO4·2H2O system is unstable, adding the mass fraction 3.0% of Na4P2O7·10H2O could reduce the undercooling degree of Na2S2O3·5H2O to within 1, adding mass fraction 0.5%-2.0% of EG could reduce the undercooling degree to about 2, and mass fraction 7% of EG can completely eliminate phase separation of the system. Therefore, the optimal composition for phase change materials is 7.0% of EG, 3.0% of Na4P2O7·10H2O, and 90.0% of Na2S2O3·5H2O. The latent heat of EG/Na4P2O7·10H2O/Na2S2O3·5H2O composite is 192.5 kJ·kg-1. No liquid leakage and no phase separation when the phase transition. The thermal storage time is shorter 22.3% than pure substance, and heat release faster. © 2016, BUAA Culture Media Group Ltd.

Hydrol. Sci. J.,"The inland extending length of the freshwater–saltwater interface toe is useful in studies of seawater intrusion in coastal areas. The submarine fresh groundwater discharge in coastal zones is affected not only by hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient of the aquifer, but also by the position of the interface. Two observation wells at different distances from the coast are required to calculate the fresh groundwater flow rate in coastal unconfined aquifers. By considering that the submarine groundwater discharge is equal to the groundwater flow rate, the length of the interface toe extending inland can be estimated when the groundwater flow is at a steady-flow state. Aquifers with horizontal and sloping confined beds and without/with unique surface vertical infiltration are considered. Examples used to illustrate the application of these methods indicate that the inland extending lengths of the interface toe in aquifers with vertical surface infiltration are much shorter than those in aquifers without vertical surface infiltration, and the length of the interface in aquifers with a horizontal confining lower bed are smaller than those in aquifers with a confining lower bed sloping towards the sea. The extent of the interface on the northwestern coast near the city of Beihai in southern Guangxi, China, on 18 January 2013 was estimated as 471–478 m. Editor M.C.

J. Renewable Sustainable Energy,"Calcined copper slag (CCS) catalytic steam reforming of jatropha oil was investigated in a fixed bed tubular reactor for hydrogen. The pyrolysis mechanism of jatropha oil was characterized by high performance liquid chromatograph, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy. At 300-400 °C the fatty acid glycerides cracked into fatty acid, ketene, and acrolein. However, carboxyl, aldehyde, and ketone groups completely became broken bonds when the reactive temperature was 400-500 °C. Dynamic analysis of jatropha oil's thermogravimetric curves was researched by Coats-Redfern equation, where the jatropha oil pyrolysis process accorded with the Z-L-T equation. The activation energy E was 294.14-349.47 kJ/mol, and the pre-exponential factor A was 7.38 × 1020-3.53 × 1025min-1. Four catalysts were used for catalytic steam reforming of jatropha oil, the active components of CCS were ferric oxide and other metal oxides, and ferric oxide had a good effect on C=C double bond fracture of jatropha oil. © 2016 Author(s).",,20164603000430,063101,"Jin, Lifu (1); Wang, Hua (2); Liu, Huili (1); Hu, Jianhang (1) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Metallurgical Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction, Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",,544.1 Copper - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Activation energy - Aldehydes - Calcination - Catalytic reforming - Chemical bonds - Copper - Fatty acids - Infrared spectroscopy - Iron oxides - Ketones - Pyrolysis - Slags - Thermogravimetric analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hu, Jianhang(hujh51@126.com) ",10.1063/1.4966159,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19417012,,,,,6,"November 1, 2016",English,Steam reforming,,19.0,,,2016,American Institute of Physics Inc.,Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy,,Mechanism research of calcined copper slag catalytic steam reforming jatropha oil,,Catalytic steam reforming - Coats-Redfern equations - Fixed bed tubular reactors - High performance liquid chromatographs - Preexponential factor - Pyrolysis mechanism - Reactive temperature - Thermogravimetric curve,8
Sci. Total Environ.,"Background: Consistent evidence has shown that high diurnal temperature range (DTR) is associated with excess mortality, but little is known about the subgroups in the association. We aimed to identify the effect modifiers, including individual characteristics and specific mortality causes, of the association in a high plateau region with large DTR and extensive ethnic minorities in China. Methods: We conducted a case-only analysis in 77,319 non-accidental deaths in Yuxi during 2007-2014, and evaluated the effect modifiers of the association of high DTR exposure and mortality. All non-accidental deaths were divided into cardiovascular, respiratory, and 'other' causes. High DTR days were defined as ≥. 90th percentile of DTR. Results: Risk of mortality on high DTR days was associated with age 75-84 years (odds ratio 1.07; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.14) and ≥. 85 years (1.16; 1.08-1.24) as compared with age ≤ 64 years. The risk of the association was less for the Dai ethnic minority than Chinese Han (0.85; 0.75-0.96). Farmers (1.08; 1.03-1.14) and people with hypertension (1.09; 1.02-1.16) showed greater risk of dying on high DTR days than non-farmers and people without hypertension, respectively. Compared with 'other' mortality causes, the risk was greater with cardiovascular causes (1.09; 1.04-1.15), notably ischemic heart disease (1.16; 1.08-1.25) and myocardial infarction (1.18; 1.08-1.29) in heart disease (1.11; 1.04-1.17), and ischemic stroke (1.17; 1.06-1.28) in stroke deaths (1.09; 1.03-1.15), as well as chronic bronchitis (1.22; 1.11-1.33) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.12; 1.05-1.20) in respiratory deaths (1.11; 1.04-1.18). Conclusions: Individual characteristics and specific mortality causes can modify the association of high DTR and mortality. This knowledge may help in better targeting the vulnerable populations and developing more effective intervention strategies. © 2015.",,20161102110811,,"Ding, Zan (1, 2); Li, Liujiu (2); Xin, Lanyan (2); Pi, Fuhua (3); Dong, Wenya (1); Wen, Ye (1); Au, William W.

Anal. Chem.,"Merocyanine dyes, owing to their unique photochemical properties, are widely used to fabricate probes for the detection of biologically active small molecules and bioimaging. In this paper, merocyanine-based probes were proved of undergoing unwanted hydrolysis. To explore the strategies toward avoiding the hydrolysis, the detailed hydrolysis mechanism was first investigated, which was also confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Then a series of merocyanine dyes were rationally designed. Influences of molecular structures of the probes, the analytical media such as pH and components of the solution on the hydrolysis were systematically studied. The experimental results suggest that merocyanine based probes with low electron density are more likely to suffer the hydrolysis, which could be exacerbated by the well-accepted strategy for constructing type-II probes. It is worth noting that chemical surroundings could also exert distinctive influence on the hydrolysis. The hydrolysis could be obviously aggravated when fetal calf serum or DMSO was deployed. Our findings will definitely provide an effective and reliable approach for guiding the rational design of highly robust merocyanine-based probes and the optimization of the analytical media, which is helpful in terms of avoiding the hydrolysis of the probes and hydrolysis caused analytical errors. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,20163902854927,,"Wang, Liqiang (1); Hao, Yuanqiang (1, 2); Huang, Jianhan (1); He, Yonghui (3); Zeng, Ke (1); Li, Juan (1); Chabu, Johnny Muya (1); Chen, Wansong (1); Yang, Minghui (1); Deng, Liu (1); Liu, You-Nian (1) ","(1) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan; 410083, China (2) Henan Key Laboratory of Biomolecular Recognition and Sensing, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shangqiu Normal University, Shangqiu, Henan; 476000, China (3) Key Laboratory of Chemistry in Ethnic Medicine Resource, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650031, China ",ANCHAM,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Density functional theory - Design for testability - Probes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Deng, Liu(dengliu@csu.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02113,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15206882,"Number: 21276285, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21476266, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1404215, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21476266, 21276285, and U1404215).",,00032700,18,"September 20, 2016",English,Hydrolysis,,26.0,9136-9142,,2016,American Chemical Society,Analytical Chemistry,,Unraveling the Hydrolysis of Merocyanine-Based Probes in Biological Assay,,Analytical errors - Bio-imaging - Biological assays - Fetal calf serums - Merocyanine dye - Photochemical properties - Rational design - Small molecules,88
"Sens Actuators, B Chem","Mesoporous Co3O4nanosheets were synthesized via a facile chemical coprecipitation method without using of surfactant or template. Mesoporous Co3O4material was characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to examine the morphology and microstructure to find out the cause for the highly sensitive sensing behavior. SEM and TEM analyses reveal that the Co3O4nanosheets consisting of nanoparticles prepared here are porous in nature, with average pore sizes of approximately 50 nm or smaller. The sensor based on porous Co3O4nanaosheets was used for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including ethanol, methanol, acetone, isopropanol, formaldehyde and n-butanol. The results demonstrate that the sensor shows potential for detecting VOCs. The significant improvement of sensitivity is attributed to the porous structure, good contact and relatively small crystal size. The gas sensor shows high response values, fast response and recovery times towards VOCs. So, porous Co3O4nanosheets are considered as promising sensor material for detecting VOCs. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,20161802335179,,"Deng, Shaojuan (1); Liu, Xu (1); Chen, Nan (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 2); Wang, Yude (1, 2) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",SABCEB,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Acetone - Chemical sensors - Coprecipitation - Crystal structure - Gas detectors - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Mesoporous materials - Nanosheets - Pore size - Porous materials - Scanning electron microscopy - Transmission electron microscopy - Volatile organic compounds - X ray powder diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.snb.2016.04.138,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: ZD2013006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: XT412003, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51262029 ), the Key Project of the Department of Education of Yunnan Province ( ZD2013006 ), and Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University ( XT412003 ) Appendix A",,09254005,,"October 5, 2016",English,X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,,44.0,615-623,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,"Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical",,A highly sensitive VOC gas sensor using p-type mesoporous Co3O4nanosheets prepared by a facile chemical coprecipitation method,,Chemical coprecipitation method - Co3O4 - Fast response - High response - Porous structures - Sensing performance - Sensor materials - Small crystals,233

The implemented DPD is first investigated in 2.4 GHz WiFi over fiber transmission systems at 36 Mb/s, and more than 8-dB and 5.6-dB improvements of error vector magnitude (EVM) are achieved in back to back (BTB) and after 10 km single mode fiber (SMF) transmission. Further, both WiFi and ultra wide band (UWB) wireless signals are transmitted together, in which the DPD has linearization bandwidth of 2.4 GHz. It is shown that the implemented DPD leads to EVM improvements of 4.5-dB (BTB) and 3.1-dB (10 km SMF) for the WiFi signal, and 4.6-dB (BTB) and 4-dB (10 km SMF) for the broadband UWB signal. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20164202905742,,"Zhang, Xiupu (1, 2, 3); Liu, Taijun (1); Shen, Dongya (3) ","(1) School of Science and Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo; Zhejiang; 315211, China (2) iPhotonics Laboratories, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal; Quebec; H9K1R2, Canada (3) iCom Laboratories, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",OPCOB8,"602.2 Mechanical Transmissions - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 717.1 Optical Communication Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 741.1.2 Fiber Optics",,,,,Digital radio - Fibers - Linearization - Radio - Radio transmission - Single mode fibers - Transmissions - Ultra-wideband (UWB) - Wave transmission - Wi-Fi - Wireless local area networks (WLAN),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Taijun ",10.1016/j.optcom.2016.07.025,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,00304018,,"December 15, 2016",English,Radio-over-fiber,,17.0,346-351,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Optics Communications,,Investigation of broadband digital predistortion for broadband radio over fiber transmission systems,,Cloud radio access networks - Digital predistortion - Error vector magnitude - Fiber optic communications - Fiber transmission systems - Radio over fibers (ROF) - Transmission systems - Wireless signals,381
Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS),"With the advantages of the simpler transmitter architecture requirements, the wider swath capability and lower data rate, compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was proposed in recent ten years to substitute or compensate the disadvantage of the full polarization mode SAR, especially on widening the swath width. CP mode is transmitted with one polarization and received with both of them. As there are only two channels, the decomposition methods and theories which were used for full polarization can not directly apply into it. According to the characteristics of CP mode, the decomposition theory based on partial polarized waves were developed, like the degree of polarization and phase difference (m-δ) decomposition, the degree of polarization and scattering angle (m-α), the degree polarization and the Poincare ellipticity parameter (m-χ) decomposition. Since α and χ are mutual complementary angle, the result of these two decomposition is same. Since the main purpose of decomposition is to classify the different objects, this paper focus on the classification result difference of m-δ and m-α, the interpretation of these results and how to improve the classification based on the better decomposition results. In this paper, the classification results of these two decomposition methods were compared with full polarization classification result. The classification overall accuracy of m-α is 97.17%, whereas m-δ is 88.28%. The kappa coefficient for the former is 0.8500, the latter is 0.8207. Since the volume scattering component is same, the differences were caused by surface scattering component and dihedral component. The statistics of these two components shown that α has better accumulativeness than δ, which lead to the higher classification accuracy. Both of these two method result in higher assessment of volume scattering. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170103214388,7730228.0,"Zhang, Wangfei (1); Ji, Yongjie (1); Wang, Leiguang (1); Li, Wenmei (2); Yu, Longhua (2) ","(1) College of Forestry, Southwest Forestry University, Bailong Road Panlong district, Kunming, Yunnan; 650224, China (2) School of Geography and Biological Information, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, No. 9 Wenyuan road, Jiangsu; 210023, China ",IGRSE3,,124694.0,"July 10, 2016 - July 15, 2016","Beijing, China","36th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2016",,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730228,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509033324.0,,,"November 1, 2016",English,,"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2016 - Proceedings",4.0,4706-4709,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS),"The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS)",The classification results interpretation for compact SAR data based on partial polarization decomposition,,,2016-November

Mater. Sci. Eng. C,"In this work, interconnected porous Ti-HA biocomposites with enhanced bioactivity, high porosity and compressive strength were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) and space holder method. Pore characteristics, mechanical properties, corrosion behaviors and in vitro bioactivity of the porous Ti-HA were investigated. Results showed that porous Ti-HA with 5–30 wt% HA contents possessed not only low elastic modulus of 8.2–15.8 GPa (close to that of human bone) but also high compressive strength (86–388 MPa). Although the HA partially decomposed and formed secondary phases, the sintered porous Ti-HA can still be good bioactivity. The homogeneity and the thickness of apatite layer increased significantly with the increase of HA. But with the thickness of apatite layer increased, micro-cracks appeared on the surface of porous Ti-30%HA. A model was built to discuss the current distribution and sintering mechanism of HA on Ti matrix during SPS process. It indicated that the excessive addition of HA would deteriorate the sintering quality, thus decreasing the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. However, the combination of interconnected pore characteristics, low elastic modulus, high compressive strength and enhanced bioactivity might make porous Ti-HA biocomposites prepared by SPS a promising candidate for hard tissue implants. © 2016",,20163102674719,,"Zhang, L.

RSC Adv.,"First-principles calculations are performed to study the electronic properties and metal ion storage capabilities of the two-dimensional (2D) Nb2C monolayer and its corresponding fluoride and hydroxide materials. We show that the Nb2C monolayer and the derived Nb2CF2and Nb2C(OH)2are all metallic in their most stable configurations. We systematically investigate the adsorption and surface diffusion of different metal atom species A = Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, Ca, Al. We find that the bare Nb2C monolayer has excellent performance in the case of Li or Mg: the material remains metallic after adsorption; the ion diffusion is fast with extremely low diffusion barrier; the storage capacity is high (∼542 mA h g-1for Li and ∼1084 mA h g-1for Mg); and the average intercalation potential is relatively low. Particularly, the diffusion barrier heights for the elements Li, Na, K, Mg and Ca are all lower than 0.1 eV. In addition, the functional groups tend to strongly degrade the performance, which should be avoided in experiment as much as possible. Our results suggest that the Nb2C monolayer is a promising anode material for Li- or non-Li-ion batteries. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20161302152438,,"Hu, Junping (1, 2, 3, 5); Xu, Bo (4); Ouyang, Chuying (4); Zhang, Ying (6); Yang, Shengyuan A.

J. Spectroscopy,"Nicotine, the important component of cigarette products, may have an impact on the oral environment after inhalation. The research of interaction between nicotine and bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) contributes to understand the binding mechanism of nicotine and BSM, and the effects of nicotine on the structure and function of the mucin. NMR data demonstrated that the interaction between nicotine and BSM did exist, and it was pyrrolidyl ring of nicotine playing the major role in the binding. The quenching mechanisms of nicotine and BSM in different pH were different: for acidic environment, the quenching was dynamic; while it became static in the alkaline circumstance. Synchronous fluorescence spectra indicated that nicotine had effect on the microenvironment of the Trp rather than Tyr residue. Meanwhile, the impact of nicotine on the conformation of BSM was also confirmed by 3D fluorescence and FTIR spectra. © 2016 Xiaoxiang Liao et al.",Open Access,20161202131018,9580136.0,"Liao, Xiaoxiang (1, 2); Yuan, Dalin (2); Tang, Jianguo (2); Yang, Hongqin (1); Liang, Bing (1); Cheng, Qiang (1); Li, Hui (1) ","(1) College of Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan; 610065, China (2) Technology Center, China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial Co., Ltd., Kunming, Yunnan; 650204, China ",,"537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,,Alkalinity - Fluorescence - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Mammals - Quenching,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Jianguo(jgtang@163.com) ",10.1155/2016/9580136,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),23144939,,,,23144920,,2016,English,Nicotine,,40.0,,,2016,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Journal of Spectroscopy,,"Probing into the Interaction of Nicotine and Bovine Submaxillary Mucin: NMR, Fluorescence, and FTIR Approaches",,3d fluorescences - Acidic environment - Binding mechanisms - FT-IR spectrum - Microenvironments - NMR data - Quenching mechanisms - Synchronous fluorescence,2016
J. Vinyl Addit. Technol.,"New impact modifiers composed of a ground tire rubber core and acrylates and styrene copolymer shell have been obtained by using a suspension grafting polymerization. The corresponding rigid poly(vinyl chloride)/grafted ground tire rubber (RPVC/GGTR) composites with different contents of GGTR were then prepared in a Haake torque rheometer. Similar composites with raw ground tire rubber (without grafting polymerization) have also been prepared for comparison. Thermal stability, processability, mechanical properties, and surface morphology of the composites were extensively investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), rheological measurement, tensile and impact tests, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that GGTR improved the processability of the RPVC/GGTR composites. The Izod impact strength of the composites could be significantly enhanced by the GGTR, while the tensile strength of the composites was almost unchanged, thus showing a large potential application in the fields of building materials such as poly(vinyl chloride) profiles.

Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"In this paper, two chemosensors derived from rhodamine were reported for cysteine optical recognition. An up-conversion NaYF4lattice was applied as excitation host to minimize chemosensor photobleaching. This NaYF4lattice was firstly modified with α-cyclodextrin, making it water dispersible. It was found that chemosensor absorption matched well with host emission. The energy transfer between this excitation host and our chemosensors was analyzed and confirmed by their spectral analysis and emission decay lifetime comparison. Detailed analysis suggested that the recognition mechanism between our chemosensors and cysteine was a simple one with binding stoichiometry of 1:1. Our chemosensors showed emission 'off-on' effect towards cysteine with good photostability. Maximum sensitivity was obtained as 7.90 for our chemosensors with a linear working curve.

For. Ecol. Manage.,"Owing to the existence of global Pleistocene refugia, the relict and ancient component of the modern endemic flora is considerable in South-Central China. Study of these relict species helps to understand past and recent ecological processes affecting species persistence, and also provides knowledge to guide human-assisted management and conservation practice. In this study, we investigated the current status of the remnant populations of Cathaya argyrophylla, one of the emblematic 'living fossils', growing in the Dalou Mountains of South-Central China. We quantified the population structure of C. argyrophylla and investigated demographic changes of seedlings over a ten year period to learn the plant's regeneration patterns following the establishment of two national and provincial nature reserves in late 1970s. Notable 'gaps' in age structure over 40 years were found, suggesting significant recruitment failures in these scattered population since the establishment of the nature reserves. Further, the number of dead individuals peaked at ages between 40 and 80 years and the seedlings showed high mortality in the past 10 years, probably due to intensified competition from the nearby broad-leaved trees and the reduction of suitable micro-habitats. These facts indicated that attention needs to be paid and follow-up measures should be taken to more effectively conserve C. argyrophylla in the future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",,20154901642430,,"Qian, Shenhua (1); Yang, Yongchuan (2, 3, 4, 5); Tang, Cindy Q.

Mech Syst Signal Process,"In this paper, a novel multipitch measurement (MPM) method is proposed for acoustic signals. Starting from the analysis of moving targets? acoustic signatures, a pitch-based harmonics representation model of acoustic signal is put forward. According to the proposed harmonics model, a modified greatest common divisor (MGCD) method is developed to obtain an initial multipitch set (IMS). Subsequently, the harmonic number vector (HNV) associated with the IMS is determined by maximizing the objective function formulated as a multi-impulse-Train weighted symmetric average magnitude sum function (SAMSF) of the observed signal. The frequencies of SAMSF are determined by the target acoustic signal, the periods of the multi-impulse-Train are governed by the estimated IMS harmonics and the maximization of the objective function is figured out through a time-domain matching of periodicities of the multi-impulse-Train with that of the SAMSF. Finally, by using the obtained IMS and its HNV, a precise fundamental frequency set is achieved. Evaluation of the algorithm performances in comparison with state-of-The-Art methods indicates that MPM is practical for the multipitch extraction of moving targets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20161202140442,,"Huang, Jingchang (1); Guo, Feng (2); Zu, Xingshui (2); Li, Haiyan (3); Liu, Huawei (2); Li, Baoqing (2) ","(1) China Research Laboratory, IBM-Research, China (2) Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology, Shanghai; CAS, China (3) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",MSSPEP,751.1 Acoustic Waves - 751.2 Acoustic Properties of Materials - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Acoustic intensity - Acoustic waves - Harmonic analysis - Natural frequencies - Time domain analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Jingchang(hjingc@cn.ibm.com) ",10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.02.048,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10961216,,,,08883270,,"December 15, 2016",English,Harmonic functions,,42.0,419-432,,2016,Academic Press,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing,,A novel multipitch measurement algorithm for acoustic signals of moving targets,,Acoustic signal analysis - Average magnitude sum function - Fundamental frequencies - Harmonics - Moving targets - Multi-impulse-Train,81
J. Cent. South Univ.,"A superposing principle, by suitably adding the strain waves from a number of concentrated explosive charges to approximate the waves generated by a cylindrical charge based on the strain wave of a point or small spherical explosive charge generated in rock, is used to further study the triggering time of strain gauges installed in radial direction at same distances but different positions surrounding a cylindrical explosive charge in rock. The duration of the first compression phase and peak value of strain wave, and furthermore, their differences are analyzed and some explanations are given. Besides that, the gauge orientation in which the maximum peak value occurs is also discussed. At last, the effect of velocity of detonation (V.O.D.) of a cylindrical explosive charge on the strain waves generated in the surrounding rock is taken as key research and the pattern of peak amplitude of a strain wave varies with the V.O.D. is likely to have been found. © 2016, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20165003125045,,"Liu, Ke-wei (1, 2, 3); Li, Xiao-han (1, 3); Li, Xi-bing (1, 3); Yao, Zhi-hua (2); Shu, Zong-xian (2); Yuan, Ming-hua (2) ","(1) School of Resources and Safety Engineering, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (2) Yuxi Mining Co.

J. Sensors,"Pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) has been widely used in image processing. The 3D binary map series (BMS) generated by PCNN effectively describes image feature information such as edges and regional distribution, so BMS can be treated as the basis of extracting 1D oscillation time series (OTS) for an image. However, the traditional methods using BMS did not consider the correlation of the binary sequence in BMS and the space structure for every map. By further processing for BMS, a novel facial feature extraction method is proposed. Firstly, consider the correlation among maps in BMS; a method is put forward to transform BMS into frequency map series (FMS), and the method lessens the influence of noncontinuous feature regions in binary images on OTS-BMS. Then, by computing the 2D entropy for every map in FMS, the 3D FMS is transformed into 1D OTS (OTS-FMS), which has good geometry invariance for the facial image, and contains the space structure information of the image. Finally, by analyzing the OTS-FMS, the standard Euclidean distance is used to measure the distances for OTS-FMS. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of OTS-FMS in facial recognition, and it shows better recognition performance than other feature extraction methods. © 2016 Rencan Nie et al.",Open Access,20155001664289,5491341.0,"Nie, Rencan (1); Zhou, Dongming (1); He, Min (1); Jin, Xin (1); Yu, Jiefu (1) ","(1) College of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"655.1 Spacecraft, General - 656 Space Flight - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations",,,,,Binary sequences - Extraction - Face recognition - Feature extraction - Neural networks - Space applications - Space platforms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Dongming(zhoudm@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1155/2016/5491341,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),16877268,,,,1687725X,,2016,English,Binary images,,17.0,,,2016,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Journal of Sensors,,Facial Feature Extraction Using Frequency Map Series in PCNN,,Euclidean distance - Facial feature extraction - Facial recognition - Feature extraction methods - Image features - Pulse coupled neural network - Regional distribution - Space structure,2016
Kexue Tongbao/Chin. Sc. Bull.,"Music Syntax refers to the principle of combining discrete key elements into hierarchical system. Organization of pitches based on tonality harmony is the most important music syntax which affects the expectation, the construction and the feedback on the music events of the audience from which aesthetic musical experience is finally produced. Lerdahl and Jackendoff proposed a musical tree-structure that parallel to linguistic syntax in their generative theory of tonal music (GTTM). And Rohrmeier further specified hierarchical generativerules of pitch syntax in the generative syntax model (GSM). Both the GTTM and the GSM put forward the analogy between music syntax and linguistic syntax. But what is obviously different from language processing is that the processing of music syntax of the audience reveals a cross-empiricalness effects. Whether in early studies of behavioristics or in recent studies of EPR, most evidences support that there is a syntax diagram guiding people's musical expectations without much association with their musical experiences among western audience, at least in the sense of simple linear syntax. Therefore, the acquisition of music syntax under the non-explicit conditions arouses researchers' thinking on music syntax processing mechanism. Current studies have not reached a consensus on processing of syntactic structure, and two antagonistic theories 'Cognitivism' and 'Physicalism' have generated. 'Cognitivism' put forward that since pitch syntax reflects abstract cognitive structural relations between sounds and meanings, syntactic integration requires the help of scheme drive of long-term memory, of which MUSACT and the shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis (SSIRH) are the representative theories. While 'Physicalism' considered that it only needs the help of short-term memory in perception drive because pitch syntax has a property of psychoacoustics derived from voice frequency. And the periodicity pitch model (PP) and its derivate, the auditory short-term memory (ASTM), are the representative theories. Both theories demonstrated their viewpoints respectively from the angle of theoretical model, behavioral studies and cognitive neuroscience. It is necessary for future study to move on in the following aspects: (i) Investigations on the processing capability and mechanism of large scale nested syntactic hierarchical structure and it has to focus on what factors and mechanism affect the integration of syntactic hierarchical structure of the audience. It is especially essential to discuss the effect of working memory on how it works to integrate scheme drive mechanism and perception drive mechanism. (ii) Discussions on the controversy of scheme drive and perception drive should be conducted under conditions of different hierarchical syntactic levels and time windows. Meanwhile, experiments and statistics can be used to separate the mechanism effect of perception drive and scheme drive and to study the possible interaction. (iii) The application of EEG and FMRI can be further implemented to disclose functions of ERP by integrating statistics of time-domain analysis and frequency-domain analysis. Besides, FMRI, PET and MEG need to be extended from orientation studies to dynamic connection mode of brain function. (iv) Discussions on the relationship of syntax and emotions should also be carried out under conditions of different hierarchical syntax structure levels under which the effect and mechanism of induced emotion may be different. All in all, the exploration of music syntactic processing could be used to reveal the characteristics of human advanced cognitive wisdom. Meanwhile, it has an important clinical value. It is expected our study can further reveal the mechanism of music syntax and promote the understanding of it, which can be helpful for clinical practices. © 2016, Science Press.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"Discriminating the maturity levels of tobacco leaf with in-situ measurement can effectively reduce loss rate and quality decline due to misjudgment of the maturity levels of tobacco leaf. In the meantime, the regular way we use to determine the maturity levels of tobacco, which is depend on tobacco leaf age and judgment of tobacco grower, lacks of objectivity. So this paper proposed a method to identify maturity levels of tobacco leaf by using spectral feature parameters combined with the method of support vector machine (SVM). In this paper, a total of 351 tobacco leaf samples collected in 5 maturity levels including immature (M1), unripe (M2), mature (M3), ripe (M4), and mellow (M5) determined by experts were scanned by field spectroscope(ASD FieldSpec3) with in-situ measurement for getting their reflectance spectrum. Through spectral analysis we found that the spectrum of tobacco leaf with different levels of maturity can be distinguished in visible band but not easily be distinguished in near-infrared band, so we use the tobacco leaf spectrum in visible band as the sensitive bands to analyze and model. To find the most suitable input variables for modeling, we use continuous spectrum (350~780 nm), feature band (496~719 nm) and spectral feature parameters (the reflectance of green peak, location of green peak, first order differential value of red-edge and blue-edge, red-edge and blue-edge area, location of red-edge and blue-edge) in visible region as the input variables, and using these three kinds of input variables in the method of SVM to establish a discriminant model for identifying maturity levels of tobacco leaf. The result shows that, the model using spectral feature parameters gains the accuracy rate of 98.85%. While the accuracy rates of other two models were 90.80% and 93.10%, respectively. The conclusion was drawn that using spectral feature parameters in visible spectrum as the input variables in SVM can improve the model performance. It is feasible to use this method to identify maturity level of tobacco leaf with in-situ measurement. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Hanjie Xuebao,"The failure mode and mechanism of BGA packages were explored by drop tests of PCB packages. Furthermore, the initiation mechanism and expanding features of cracks were analyzed in this work. Results showed that, cracks in the solder joints and structural fractures of PCB are the main reasons that cause the failure of BGA packages. There are two main kinds of cracks in solder joints which distribute on the joint top and bottom, and the initiation mechanism of them are different. Micro gaps between the solder joint and solder resist film that caused by gravity contribute to the cracks on the top. Cracks on the bottom are caused by the gaps on both sides of the remained solder flux that existed between the solder joint and the solder resist film under drop-impact load. The expanding of cracks has a relationship with the original location, orientation and stress conditions of the crack sources. Relative position of solder joint and pad also have important influence on the expanding of cracks. © 2016, Editorial Board of Transactions of the China Welding Institution, Magazine Agency Welding.

Huanjing Kexue,"The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of different nitrogen rates on the nitrification potential in intercropping maize soils. The experiment included two plantation types (maize monocropping and intercropping maize and potato) and four nitrogen levels (N0: no fertilizer treatment, N1: 1/2 conventional fertilizer treatment, N2: conventional fertilizer treatment, N3: 3/2 conventional fertilizer treatment). Abundance of AOA and AOB was analyzed with real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) and soil properties were also measured. Results of this study suggested that the PNF of soils, the abundance of AOA and AOB were increased with increasing N fertilization in conventional fertilizer range, and there was no significant difference between N2 and N3 treatments. The influences of intercropping on PNF, AOA and AOB were associated with N application rates and crop growth period, as well as the benefits of ammonia oxidizer and nitrification of intercropping on N1 level. Fertilization was obviously the main driving force of the PNF, correlation analysis indicated that water content was the main environmental factor affecting the nitrification potential. Nitrification potential in maize and potato intercropping soils exhibited significant positive correlations with AOA and AOB amoA gene abundance. Maize and potato intercropping could decrease the abundance of AOA and AOB, but it resulted in dominance of AOB among nitrification bacteria in these soils. In conclusion, N fertilizer and intercropping could affect both soil nitrogen internal cycling process and the abundance of AOA and AOB, which further affected soil environmental quality. © 2016, Science Press.

"IEEE Ind. Appl. Soc., Annu. Meet.: IAS","The equivalent inertia of power system is reducing with the increasing wind power penetration. To alleviate this issue, more and more countries have put forward grid codes which require wind farms (WFs) to perform inertia control so as to provide synthetic inertia response as traditional synchronous generation (SG) does. It is found in this paper that the inertia control of the WF in a weak grid deteriorates drive-train torsion of wind turbine generators (WTGs). Furthermore, the WF emulating inertia response is involved in power system oscillations and a new critical low frequency oscillation mode is induced by the WF. These two potential risks restrict the WF to fulfill grid code requirements. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a two-level damping control scheme consisting of a WTG level torsional oscillation damping control and a WF level low frequency oscillation damping control to enhance damping characteristic of the WF. Simulation results show that the two-level damping control can counteract these potential risks and facilitates the WF to meet grid code requirements. © 2016 IEEE.",,20165003111640,7731844.0,"Xi, Xinze (1); Geng, Hua (1); Yang, Geng (1) ","(1) Department of Automation, Tsinghua University Electric Power Research, Institute of Yunnan Power Grid Co., Ltd, Beijing, China ",,"615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 705.2 Electric Generators - 705.2.1 AC Generators - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 931.1 Mechanics",124722.0,"October 2, 2016 - October 6, 2016","Portland, OR, United states","52nd Annual Meeting on IEEE Industry Application Society, IAS 2016",Asynchronous generators - Codes (symbols) - Damping - Electric utilities - Turbogenerators - Wind power - Wind turbines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/IAS.2016.7731844,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467386715.0,,,"November 2, 2016",English,Electric power transmission networks,"IEEE Industry Application Society, 52nd Annual Meeting: IAS 2016",29.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE Industry Application Society, 52nd Annual Meeting: IAS 2016",,Two-level damping control for DFIG-based wind farm providing synthetic inertial service,,Damping characteristics - Damping control - Grid code requirements - inertia response - Low frequency oscillations - Power system oscillations - Torsional oscillation - Wind power penetration,

"Int. Conf. Microw. Millim. Wave Technol., ICMMT - Proc.","In this paper, a new-version microstrip line is proposed, named packaged microstrip line. It is comprised of three dielectric substrates. This novel microstrip line is no longer suffering from the issues of radiation losses, surface waves, or cavity resonances that exist in the standard microstrip line without or with a metallic shielding box. Instead of the packaging way based on the standard air gap waveguide technology, this novel packaged microstrip line has the following merits: greatly reduced weight and size, easy manufacturing, constant gap height and more flexibility in design. We present how to adopt a proper dielectric substrate for each layer of the packaged microstrip line considering both stopband and line losses, and how to design the line width for a given characteristic impedance. One prototype of this proposed novel packaged microstrip lines is fabricated and tested, showing a good agreement with the simulated results. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170403267965,7761684.0,"Zhang, Jing (1, 2); Zhang, Xiupu (1, 2); Shen, Dongya (2); Kishk, Ahmed A.

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"A test for ordered categorical variables is of considerable importance, because they are frequently encountered in biomedical studies. This paper introduces a simple ordering test approach for the two-way r×c contingency tables with incomplete counts by developing six test statistics, i.e., the likelihood ratio test statistic, score test statistic, global score test statistic, Hausman-Wald test statistic, Wald test statistic and distance-based test statistic. Bootstrap resampling methods are also presented. The performance of the proposed tests is evaluated with respect to their empirical type I error rates and empirical powers. The results show that the likelihood ratio test statistic based on the bootstrap resampling methods perform satisfactorily for small to large sample sizes.

Circ Syst Signal Process,"Underdetermined blind source separation (UBSS) is a hard problem to solve since its mixing system is not invertible. The well-known “two-step approach” has been widely used to solve the UBSS problem and the most pivotal step is to estimate the underdetermined mixing matrix. To improve the estimation performance, this paper proposes a new clustering method. Firstly, the observed signals in the time domain are transformed into sparse signals in the frequency domain; furthermore, the linearity clustering of sparse signals is translated into compact clustering by normalizing the observed data. And then, the underdetermined mixing matrix is estimated by clustering methods. The K-means algorithm is one of the classical methods to estimate the mixing matrix but it can only be applied to know the number of clusters in advance. This is not in accord with the actual situation of UBSS. In addition, the K-means is very sensitive to the initialization of clusters and it selects the initial cluster centers randomly. To overcome the fatal flaws, this paper employs affinity propagation (AP) clustering to get the exact number of exemplars and the initial clusters. Based on those results, the K-means with AP clustering as initialization is used to precisely estimate the underdetermined mixing matrix. Finally, the source signals are separated by linear programming. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively estimate the mixing matrix and is more suitable for the actual situation of UBSS. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,20162602536865,,"He, Xuan-sen (1); He, Fan (2); Cai, Wei-hua (1) ","(1) College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha; 410082, China (2) School of Politics and Public Administration, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650504, China ",CSSPEH,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics",,,,,Cluster analysis - Frequency domain analysis - Linear programming - Matrix algebra - Mixing - Time domain analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","He, Xuan-sen(hxs2010@hnu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s00034-015-0173-7,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15315878,,,,0278081X,8.0,"August 1, 2016",English,Blind source separation,,47.0,2881-2913,,2016,Birkhauser Boston,"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing",,Underdetermined BSS Based on K-means and AP Clustering,,Affinity propagation - Compact clustering - K - means clustering - Sparse representation - Underdetermined blind source separations (UBSS),35

In this study, based on actual project, we process samples of different sizes and measure their uniaxial compressive strength. Contrastive analysis shows that uniaxial compressive strength decreases with the increase of sample size. Through fitting, we get the relation formula between uniaxial compressive strength and size effect. When side length of sample is 30 mm, the uniaxial compressive strength is close to the standard strength defined in the code.

Mater.

Here we present BiOCl semiconductor poly-crystals with two-dimensional structure, in which approximate 100-fold UC luminescence enhancement of Er3+ion dopants can be readily achieved via intercalation doping of Li+ions. As Li+ions were incorporated into the interlayer of BiOCl crystals, unique internal electric field (IEF) in BiOCl that trigger unusual photon avalanche (PA) UC phenomena accompanying with excitation field enhancement of Er3+ions can be improved significantly, leading to the excellent UC enhancement.

Proc. Winter Simul. Conf.,"In this paper, we study a MAP/PH/1 queue with two classes of customers and discretionary priority. There are two stages of service for the low-priority customer. The server adopts the preemptive priority discipline at the first stage and adopts the nonpreemptive priority discipline at the second stage. Such a queueing system can be modelled into a quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process. But there is no general solution for this QBD process since the generator matrix has a block structure with an infinite number of blocks and each block has infinite dimensions. We present an approach to derive the bound for the high-priority queue length. It guarantees that the probabilities of ignored states are within a given error bound, so that the system can be modelled into a QBD process where the block elements of the generator matrix have finite dimensions.

Forests,"Eight triploids were screened among offspring of the rubber tree clone GT1 × different clones by flow cytometry and chromosome counting. Twenty-five simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were screened to identify the origin of 2n gametes, to determine the male parents of these triploids, and to evaluate the mechanism of 2n gamete formation using band configurations and microsatellite DNA allele counting peak ratios (MAC-PR). The results showed that 2n gametes originated from the maternal rubber tree clone GT1, contributing the extra genome copy present in the triploids. It was confirmed that GT1 is able to produce a 2n megagametophyte spontaneously. Many male parents were shown to provide pollen for formation of triploid rubber trees, including clones RRIC 103, Yunyan 277-5, and three other clones. The second division restitution (SDR) was likely the main mechanism involved in formation of megagametophytes in GT1, as the rate of maternal heterozygosity restitution (HR) of all eight triploids varied from 27.78% to 75.00%, with a mean of 51.46%, and all 25 markers varied from 0% to 100%, with a mean of 51.69%. Elucidation of the origin and formation of 2n gametes will help optimize further sexual hybridization of polyploid rubber trees. © 2016 by the authors.",Open Access,20170103208426,301.0,"Yao, Peng-Qiang (1); Li, Guo-Hua (2); Long, Qing-Yi (2); He, Li-Gang (2); Kang, Xiang-Yang (1) ","(1) National Engineering Laboratory for Tree Breeding, College of Biological Sciences and Technology, Key Lab of Genetics and Breeding in Forest Trees and Ornamental Plants, Ministry of Education, Beijing Laboratory of Urban and Rural Ecological Environment, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing; 100083, China (2) Tropic Crops Science Research Institute of Yunnan Province, Jinghong; 666100, China ",,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.8.1 Genetic Engineering - 818.1 Natural Rubber,,,,,Cloning - DNA sequences - Genes - Rubber,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Kang, Xiang-Yang(kangxy@bjfu.edu.cn) ",10.3390/f7120301,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19994907,"Number: 5141001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; ","This work was supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation (5141001), Special Found for Beijing Common Construction Project.",,,12.0,2016,English,Forestry,,43.0,,,2016,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Forests,,Male parent identification of triploid rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) and the mechanism of 2n gametes formation,,2n gamete - Chromosome counting - Hevea brasiliensis - Male parents - Microsatellite DNA - Rubber tree - Simple sequence-repeat markers - Triploids,7

Water Res.,"The compositional properties of water-extractable organic nitrogen (WEON) affect its behavior in lake ecosystems. This work is the first comprehensive study using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) for the characterization of the molecular composition of WEON in lake sediment. In sediments of Erhai Lake in China, this study found complex WEON species, with N-containing compounds in the northern, central, and southern regions contributing 34.47%, 42.44%, and 40.6%, respectively, of total compounds. Additionally, a van Krevelen diagram revealed that lignin components were dominant in sediment WEON structures (68% of the total), suggesting terrestrial sources. Furthermore, this study applied ESI-FT-ICR-MS to the examination of the environmental processes of lake sediment WEON on a molecular level. The results indicated that sediment depth impacted WEON composition and geochemical processes. Compared with other ecosystems, the double bond equivalent (DBE) value was apparently lower in Erhai sediment, indicating the presence of relatively fewer and smaller aromatic compounds. In addition, the presence of a large number of N-containing species and abundant oxidized nitrogen functional compounds that were likely to biodegrade may have further increased the potential releasing risk of WEON from Erhai sediment under certain environmental conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20164102895569,,"Zhang, Li (1, 2, 3); Wang, Shengrui (1, 2, 3); Xu, Yisheng (1, 2, 4); Shi, Quan (5); Zhao, Haichao (1, 2, 3); Jiang, Bin (5); Yang, Jiachun (1, 2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing; 100012, China (2) State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory for Lake Pollution Control, Research Center of Lake Eco-environment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing; 100012, China (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650034, China (4) Atmospheric Chemistry and Aerosol Research Division, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Science, Beijing; 100012, China (5) State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, China University of Petroleum, Beijing; 102249, China ",WATRAG,454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 801 Chemistry - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 932.1.1 Particle Accelerators - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Characterization - Cyclotrons - Ecosystems - Electron cyclotron resonance - Fourier transforms - Ions - Lakes - Mass spectrometry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shengrui ",10.1016/j.watres.2016.09.059,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18792448,"Number: 2012002001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: SKLECRA201651, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014-GOT-042-N-06, Acronym: CAREERI CAS, Sponsor: Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: U1202235, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41503113, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers U1202235 , 41503113 ), the National High-level Personnel of Special Support Program (People Plan, grant number 2012002001 ), and the Free Exploration Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment (grant number: SKLECRA201651 ), Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences (grant number 2014-GOT-042-N-06 ).

J. Cent. South Univ.,"The feasibility study of the AlCl(g) generated by Al2O−AlCl2−C system under vacuum was carried out by thermodynamic analysis and CASTEP package of the Material Studio program which was based on density functional theory (DFT) formalism. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that AlCl and CO molecules can be formed under conditions of temperature 1760 K and the pressure of 60 Pa. The interaction of Al2O and AlCl2with C shows that the chemical adsorption of Al2O and AlCl2does take place on C(001) crystal plane, and at the same time, new chemical bond is formed between Al atom in Al2O and Cl atoms from one of the Al—Cl bonds in AlCl2. The results, after 1.25 ps dynamics simulation, indicate that adsorbed AlCl molecules are generated and CO molecule will be formed in this system, and they will escape from C(001) surface after a longer period of dynamic simulation time. It means that the reaction of Al2O and AlCl2with C can be carried out under given constraint condition. © 2016, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20160601910274,,"Lu, Yong (1, 2); Zhou, Yue-zhen (1, 2); Chen, Xiu-min (1, 2); Li, Zi-yong (1, 2); Yu, Qing-chun (1, 2); Liu, Da-chun (1, 2); Yang, Bin (1, 2); Xu, Bao-qiang (1, 2) ","(1) National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy (Kunming University of Science and Technology), Kunming; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Nonferrous Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming; 650093, China ",,641.1 Thermodynamics - 723.1.1 Computer Programming Languages - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 921 Mathematics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Atoms - Calculations - Density functional theory - Molecular dynamics - Molecules - Reaction kinetics - Thermoanalysis - Thermodynamic properties - Thermodynamics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Xiu-min(chenxiumin9@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/s11771-016-3072-6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22275223,,,,20952899,2.0,"February 1, 2016",English,C (programming language),,25.0,286-292,,2016,Central South University of Technology,Journal of Central South University,,Thermodynamic analysis and dynamics simulation on reaction of Al2O and AlCl2with carbon under vacuum,,Ab initio molecular dynamics - Al2O - Carbothermic - Constraint conditions - Dynamics simulation - interaction - Thermo dynamic analysis - Thermodynamic calculations,23
Appl Surf Sci,"ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by an ionothermal precipitation method in a ChCl:DEG deep eutectic solvent using Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O as a zinc source. A possible mechanism for the ZnO nucleation is discussed. The as-prepared ZnO samples were thoroughly examined by XRD, TEM, SEM, FTIR and XPS. The thermal and optical properties were further characterized by TGA/DTA, UV-vis and PL spectra, respectively. The results show that wurtzite ZnO mono-crystals with an average size of 30 ± 1 nm were achieved, and their morphology was expressed as a polyhedron with distorted hexagonal base faces. Furthermore, the DEG molecules were incorporated into the surfaces of the ZnO crystals and could only be removed by thermal annealing; the molecules persisted after washing with ordinary solvents. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) shows that the ZnO NPs modified via DEG molecules are stable in an aqueous suspension without additives. In addition, the inclusion of DEG promotes light absorption at a longer wavelength but reduces the intensity of emissions. XPS reveals that the removal of DEG induced exposed polar surfaces and defects and thus increased the intensity of photoluminescence, especially blue emission. The findings of this work not only provide a facile and environmentally friendly ionothermal method to prepare uniform ZnO NPs protected by DEG but also improve the aqueous suspension stability. Consequently, the photocatalytic performance is enhanced. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Multimedia Tools Appl,"Multiple images of an object can be obtained from a catadioptric system consisting of a pinhole camera and two planar mirrors. In this paper, we present two types of algorithm for obtaining the intrinsic parameters of a camera by computing the imaged circular points. First, according to the geometric features of the two planar mirror images, the vanishing points along the normal directions of the planar mirrors are obtained, and the vanishing points along the directions of the planar mirrors are computed using the cross-ratio invariability. Subsequently, we propose two methods of solving for the imaged circular points: one uses the inference of the Laguerre theorem, and the other uses the intersection points of the conic image and the vanishing line. Finally, the camera’s intrinsic parameters are obtained by applying the constraints on imaging the circular points to the image of the absolute conic. A simulation, real data, and a 3D reconstruction are presented to show the feasibility and validity of the proposed approaches. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,20152300917242,,"Zhao, Yue (1); Zhang, Xiaofen (1); Wang, Yalin (1); Xu, Limin (1) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China ",MTAPFB,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 742.2 Photographic Equipment",,,,,Computation theory - Mirrors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Yue(zhao6685@yeah.net) ",10.1007/s11042-015-2716-0,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15737721,,,,13807501,13.0,"July 1, 2016",English,Pinhole cameras,,26.0,7981-7997,,2016,Springer New York LLC,Multimedia Tools and Applications,,Camera self-calibration based on circular points with two planar mirrors using silhouettes,,Camera intrinsic parameters - Circular points - Planar mirrors - Silhouette - Vanishing point,75

Meanwhile, the engineering environment is increasingly complicated, which puts forward higher requirements for the properties of concrete materials. The development of high performance concrete has become a research focus and direction of concrete material science and engineering technology in the new period. The application of nanotechnology in the concrete field can break through the limitations of traditional concrete. It is of great significance for the improvement of concrete properties and may promote the sustainable development of cement industry. Carbon nanofiber concrete is a new type of building material. However, there are few domestic studies in this aspect. For this end, with physical and mechanical properties of carbon nanofiber concrete as the research object, this paper explores measures to improve the mechanical properties of carbon nanofiber concrete.

J Alloys Compd,"The structural, elastic, electronic and optical properties of Ce1−xZrxO2(x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) fluorite type oxides are studied by researchers using the method of density functional theory (DFT) + U method. The calculated equilibrium lattice parameter, cell volume, elastic and optical properties for CeO2and ZrO2are all in good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. It is found that Ce substituted by Zr leads to the formation of the pseudo-cubic fluorite-type structure. With doping concentration × increasing, the lattice parameter, cell volume and the bond length of dCe−Oand dZr−Odecrease linearly. It is interesting to find that the hardness of materials increase with Zr concentration increasing. For Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, we also find that its ductility is good. Meanwhile, the range of the conduction band energy in the doped system becomes wider than that in the undoped system. The overlapping band phenomenon occur for all substitutions in Ce1−xZrxO2(from x = 0.25 to x = 0.75), especially for the structure of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2and Ce0.25Zr0.75O2, its second band gaps almost disappear. Based on the dielectric functions obtained, it is shown that the static dielectric constant Ε0and refractive index n0obviously decrease with Zr concentration increasing. After discussing, we know that CeO2is suitable as a useful high-refractive index film material in single and multilayered optical coatings, whereas ZrO2can be used as gate-dielectric materials in metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices, in metallurgy and as a thermal barrier coating in engines. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20181304945854,,"Tian, Dong (1, 2); Zeng, Chunhua (1, 3); Wang, Hua (1); Luo, Hongchun (3); Cheng, Xianming (1, 2); Xiang, Chao (4); Wei, Yonggang (1, 2); Li, Kongzhai (1, 2); Zhu, Xing (1, 2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (4) College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Yangtze Normal University, Fuling, Chongqing; 408100, China ",JALCEU,408 Structural Design - 482.2 Minerals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 708.1 Dielectric Materials - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 922.1 Probability Theory - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Band structure - Bond length - Cerium oxide - Density functional theory - Dielectric materials - Energy gap - Fluorspar - Gate dielectrics - Lattice constants - Metals - MOS devices - Optical coatings - Optical lattices - Optical properties - Oxide semiconductors - Reflection - Refractive index - Semiconductor doping - Structural properties - Thermal barrier coatings - Zirconia,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Hua(wanghuaheat@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.075,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2012HB009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015HB025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014HB006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FB123, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2012FD016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: KKZ3201407030, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51174105, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11305079, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51374004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51204083, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51306084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11305079 , 51374004 , 51204083 , 51174105 and 51306084 ), the introduction of talent capital group fund project of Kunming University of Science and Technology (under KKZ3201407030 ), the Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province (Project Nos.

IEEE Trans Image Process,"Person re-identification aims to match the images of pedestrians across different camera views from different locations. This is a challenging intelligent video surveillance problem that remains an active area of research due to the need for performance improvement. Person re-identification involves two main steps: feature representation and metric learning. Although the keep it simple and straightforward (KISS) metric learning method for discriminative distance metric learning has been shown to be effective for the person re-identification, the estimation of the inverse of a covariance matrix is unstable and indeed may not exist when the training set is small, resulting in poor performance. Here, we present dual-regularized KISS (DR-KISS) metric learning. By regularizing the two covariance matrices, DR-KISS improves on KISS by reducing overestimation of large eigenvalues of the two estimated covariance matrices and, in doing so, guarantees that the covariance matrix is irreversible. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses for supporting the motivations. Specifically, we first prove why the regularization is necessary. Then, we prove that the proposed method is robust for generalization. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging person re-identification datasets, VIPeR, GRID, and CUHK 01, and show that DR-KISS achieves new state-of-the-art performance. © 2016 IEEE.",,20162102408875,7451215.0,"Tao, Dapeng (1); Guo, Yanan (2); Song, Mingli (3); Li, Yaotang (2); Yu, Zhengtao (4); Tang, Yuan Yan (5, 6) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (4) School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650091, China (5) Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, 999078, China (6) College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400000, China ",IIPRE4,914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions - Inverse problems - Learning systems - Rhenium compounds - Security systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TIP.2016.2553446,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FA130, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: MYRG2015-00050-FST, Acronym: RGC, UGC, Sponsor: Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee; Number: RDG009/FST-TYY/2012, Acronym: RGC, UGC, Sponsor: Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee; Number: MYRG2015-00049-FST, Acronym: RGC, UGC, Sponsor: Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee; Number: 100-2012-A3, Acronym: FDCT, Sponsor: Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ci&ecirc;ncias e da Tecnologia; Number: 026-2013-A, Acronym: FDCT, Sponsor: Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ci&ecirc;ncias e da Tecnologia; Number: 2014HE001, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology; Number: JCYJ20140901003939001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014A030310252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: -, Acronym: STDF, Sponsor: Science and Technology Development Fund; Number: 008-2014-AMJ, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61572486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1509206, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61572428, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11361074, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61273244, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572486, Grant 61572428, Grant 61472168, Grant 61273244, Grant U1509206, and Grant 11361074, in part by the Guangdong Natural Science Funds under Grant 2014A030310252, in part by the Key Project of Yunnan Nature Science Foundation under Grant 2013FA130, in part by the Research Grants of University of Macau under Grant MYRG2015-00049-FST, Grant MYRG2015-00050-FST, and Grant RDG009/FST-TYY/2012, in part by the Science and Technology Development Fund (FDCT) of Macau under Grant 100-2012-A3, 026-2013-A, in part by the Macau-China Join Project under Grant 008-2014-AMJ, in part by the Shenzhen Technology Project under Grant JCYJ20140901003939001, and in part by the Science and Technology Innovation Talents Fund Projects within the Ministry of Science and Technology under Grant 2014HE001.",,10577149,6.0,June 2016,English,Covariance matrix,,54.0,2726-2738,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,,Person Re-Identification by Dual-Regularized KISS Metric Learning,,Distance Metric Learning - Feature representation - Intelligent video surveillance - Metric learning - Performance improvements - Person re identifications - Regularization technique - State-of-the-art performance,25
IEEE ACM Trans. Audio Speech Lang. Process.,"Compared to the categorical approach that represents affective states as several discrete classes (e.g., positive and negative), the dimensional approach represents affective states as continuous numerical values in multiple dimensions, such as the valence-arousal (VA) space, thus allowing for more fine-grained sentiment analysis. In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with VA ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Several semi-supervised methods such as the kernel method, linear regression, and the pagerank algorithm have been investigated to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words from a set of semantically similar seed words. These methods suffer from two major limitations. First, they apply an equal weight to all seeds similar to an unseen word in predicting its VA ratings. Second, even similar seeds may have quite different ratings (or an inverse polarity) of valence/arousal to the unseen word, thus reducing prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a community-based weighted graph model that can select seeds which are both similar to and have similar ratings (or the same polarity) with each unseen word to form a community (subgraph) so that its VA ratings can be estimated from such high-quality seeds using a weighted propagation scheme.

Appl. Environ. Microbiol.,"Copper sulfate (CuSO4) has been widely used as an algicide to control harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) in freshwater lakes. However, there are increasing concerns about this application, due mainly to the general toxicity of CuSO4to other aquatic species and its long-term persistence in the environment. This study reported the isolation and characterization of two natural algicidal compounds, i.e., tryptamine and tryptoline, from Streptomyces eurocidicus JXJ-0089. At a concentration of 5 μg/ml, both compounds showed higher algicidal efficiencies than CuSO4on Microcystis sp. FACHB-905 and some other harmful cyanobacterial strains. Tryptamine and tryptoline treatments induced a degradation of chlorophyll and cell walls of cyanobacteria. These two compounds also significantly increased the intracellular oxidant content, i.e., superoxide anion radical (O2-) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but reduced the activity of intracellular reductants, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), of cyanobacteria. Moreover, tryptamine and tryptoline treatments significantly altered the internal and external contents of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a common cyanotoxin. Like CuSO4, tryptamine and tryptoline led to releases of intracellular MC-LR from Microcystis, but with lower rates than CuSO4. Tryptamine and tryptoline (5 μg/ml) in cyanobacterial cultures were completely degraded within 8 days, while CuSO4persisted for months. Overall, our results suggest that tryptamine and tryptoline could potentially serve as more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative algicides than CuSO4in controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.",Open Access,20163802830404,,"Zhang, Bing-Huo (1, 2); Ding, Zhang-Gui (3); Li, Han-Quan (1); Mou, Xiao-Zhen (4); Zhang, Yu-Qin (5); Yang, Jian-Yuan (1); Zhou, En-Min (2, 3); Li, Wen-Jun (2, 3) ","(1) College of Life Science, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China (3) Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (4) Department of Biological Sciences, Kent State University, Kent; OH, United States (5) Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China ",AEMIDF,821.2 Agricultural Chemicals,,,,,Agricultural chemicals - Bacteria - Enzymes - Sulfur compounds - Toxic materials,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Mou, Xiao-Zhen(xmou@kent.edu) ",10.1128/AEM.01198-16,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10985336,"Number: 31060010, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81441093, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31528001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work, including the efforts of Bing-Huo Zhang, was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (31060010 and 81441093).

Appl Surf Sci,"Depositing strong carbide-forming elements on diamond surface can dramatically improve the interfacial bonding strength between diamond grits and metal matrix. In the present work, investigation on the preparation of Ti-coated diamond particles by microwave heating has been conducted. The morphology, microstructure, and the chemical composition of Ti-coated diamond particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDX). The thickness of Ti coating was measured and the interfacial binding strength between Ti coating and diamond was analyzed. The results show that the surface of the diamond particles could be successfully coated with Ti, forming a uniform and continuous Ti-coated layer. The TiC was found to form between the surface of diamond particles and Ti-coated layer. The amount of TiC as well as the thickness of coating increased with increasing coating temperature, furthermore, the grain size of the coating also grew gradually. The interfacial bonding strength between coating and diamond was found to be best at the temperature of 760 °C. © 2016",,20163702809245,,"Gu, Quanchao (1, 2, 4); Peng, Jinghui (1, 4); Xu, Lei (1, 3, 4); Srinivasakannan, C.

Appl. Catal. B Environ.,"Inexpensive and efficient catalysts which can promisingly operate under tolerant conditions are still urgently needed in the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution systems. Present work investigates the visible-light induced generation of bimetallic FeNi mixture with fluorescein (Fl) as photosensitizer in triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution. FeNi NPs (NPs) in situ generated were found to be in intimate contact in the nano-mixture which upon formation performs as catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the same system under air atmosphere. Under bright LED light irradiation, the system with FeNi produced more than three times hydrogen than systems with same molar amount of single Fe or Ni component. Importantly, about two-fold higher hydrogen production activity compared with noble metal Pt catalyst under air atmosphere was observed. The work exhibited an economic and effective means of harnessing cheap bimetallics for tackling photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. The mechanistic insights governing the photocatalytic processes and the factors leading to the enhanced hydrogen evolution activity were discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",,20153801299751,,"Wang, Chuan-Jun (1); Chen, Yong (1); Lv, Xiao-Jun (1); Fu, Wen-Fu (1, 2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Photochemical Conversion and Optoelectronic Materials, CAS-HKU Joint Laboratory on New Materials, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100190, China (2) College of Chemistry and Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",ACBEE3,522 Gas Fuels - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 741.1 Light/Optics - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Binary alloys - Catalysts - Hydrogen production - Light - Oxygen - Photocatalysis - Photosensitizers - Precious metals - Solutions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fu, Wen-Fu(fuwf@mail.ipc.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.09.017,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2012DFH40090, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: KGZD-EW-T05, Acronym: CAAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Number: 21471155, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1137606, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21273257, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21267025, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013CB834804, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2013CB834804) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2012DFH40090).

Anal. Methods,"This paper reports a novel aptamer biosensor for the ultrasensitive detection of codeine in aqueous solutions by the special interactions between codeine-binding aptamers. Polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM) were used to absorb gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and modify the surface of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs). The codeine aptamer was immobilized on the PAMAM/glutaraldehyde (GA)/chitosan (CHIT)-modified electrode through Au-SH affinity. The specific combination between the aptamer and codeine can obstruct the electron transfer of electrochemical probe K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6, which can be used to detect codeine. The linear range covered from 1 × 10-12mol L-1to 1 × 10-7mol L-1, and the detection limit was 3 × 10-13mol L-1. The new aptamer biosensor is sensitive and selective enough to detect codeine directly in blood serum and other aqueous solutions.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"UV-Vis and HPLC fingerprint of different harvest time of the leaves of Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br. were establish the for identification and quality evaluation to promote the development of Dai Medicine modernization. The optimal extraction condition was used to obtain UV-vis data of different harvest time which were deducted background and eight spot smooth, were collected to make the principal component analysis in SIMCA-P+11.5, identifying the samples quickly with the first three principal component three-dimensional diagram. The HPLC fingerprint were obtained with Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB C18 (250×4.6 mm, 5 μm) chromatographic column with the mobile phase of acetonitrile (B)-water (contain 0.1% formic acid) (A) for gradient elution (0~5 min, 5% B; 5~35 min, 5% B→26% B; 35~40 min, 26% B→56% B). The wavelength was set at 287 nm and the column temperature was maintained at 30. The flow rate was 1.0 mL·min-1and the injection volume was 7 μL. The HPLC fingerprint of different harvest time of the leaves of Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br. was analysised by cluster analysis to quality evaluation. Research findings showing: (1) The UV-Vis spectrogram of different harvest time of the leaves of Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br. were divided into three parts according to the absorption peak position and amplitude of variation. The first was 235 to 400 nm, the second was 400 to 500 nm, and the third was 500 to 800 nm. In the first part, absorption peak were focused on 270, 287 and 325 nm, which can reflect the fingerprint character for the high absorbance and amplitude of variation. Absorption peak were distributed in 410 and 464 nm in the second part, absorbance and amplitude of variation were lower than the first part. There was a bigger absorption peak at 665 nm in the third part, but the absorbance had no difference. The UV-Vis data of different harvest time were gathered to make the principal component analysis, the result was that the samples of same month were concentrated distribution, but different month samples were dispersed distribution. (2) HPLC fingerprint were divided into three categories through hierarchical cluster analysis, 3, 4, 5 and 7 month were the first category, 6, 8, 9 month samples were second category, the others were third category. Chemical composition and content of the same category samples were similar, but the different category samples had a obvious difference, more important is that the third category samples content was the highest. Combining UV-Vis FP and HPLC FP can identify and evaluate quickly the samples of different harvest time of the leaves of Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br.

Ceram Int,"Two LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4samples are synthesized by a low-temperature solid-state method using chlorides or acetates as raw materials, and their crystal structure, size, morphology and electrochemical performance are comparatively investigated. The results show that the two samples have the same crystal structure but with different crystal size and morphology. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4prepared from chlorides shows relatively bigger crystals with a well-developed octahedral shape with {111} faces, while the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4prepared from acetates displays a quasi octahedral shape whose edges and corners are not fully developed. Such a difference in crystal size and morphology leads to a big difference in their electrochemical performance, and the octahedral LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4prepared from chlorides has higher capacity, much better rate capability and cycling performance. Our results suggest that the crystal size and morphology difference of the two samples may be associated with the presence of unreacted chloride in the precursor derived from raw materials of chlorides, and the presence of chloride may effectively promote the formation of octahedral LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4crystal at low temperature via a solid-state reaction (500 °C in this work) © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

RSC Adv.,"Here, pristine and WO3decorated TiO2nanoparticles were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method without the use of a surfactant or template and used to fabricate gas sensors. Various techniques were employed for the characterization of the structure and morphology of the as-prepared products. The gas-sensing characteristics of the fabricated sensors were investigated for various concentrations of xylene at different temperatures. At a low operation temperature of 160 °C, the sensors possess an excellent gas response, selectivity, linear dependence, low detection limitation, and repeatability as well as long-term stability. In particular, for the high gas response of the 10.0 mol% WO3decorated TiO2nanoparticles based sensor, its response reaches 92.53 for 10 ppm xylene, which is much higher than that of the pristine TiO2based sensor. And the detection limit is 1 ppm. Those values demonstrate the potential of using WO3decorated TiO2nanoparticles for xylene gas detection, particularly with low concentration xylene.

Adv. Space Res.,"The Mg II index is usually used to represent the brightening contribution to total solar irradiance (TSI) by solar bright structures, such as faculae and network. In order to understand variations of TSI, phase relations of TSI and the chromospheric Mg II index is investigated on time-scales of one year and longer. The NOAA daily Mg II index at the time interval of November 17, 1978–October 24, 2007 is utilized to carry out correlation analyses respectively with the daily ACRIM and PMOD composites of TSI. The Mg II index is found to lead TSI by about one solar rotation period for time-scales of one year and longer. Correlation of TSI with the Mg II index on the time-scale of one year is sometimes significantly positive, sometimes statistically insignificant, and sometimes even significantly negative. When sunspot darkening is dominant, the correlation between TSI and Mg II is either negative or not significant. When TSI is backward shifted vs the Mg II index by about one rotation period, correlation between them becomes significantly positive in all years. Thus, it is after about one rotation period that a more prominent intensification is inferred to be contributed to TSI than that immediately, by bright constructions, which is represented by the Mg II index. We propose an explanation for the phase relationship of TSI and the Mg II index. © 2015 COSPAR",,20155201732188,,"Li, K.J. (1, 2); Xu, J.C. (1, 3); Xiang, N.B. (1, 3); Feng, W.

Dianli Xitong Zidonghue,"The lightning induced fault which is the most common fault reason may cause difficulty in detecting reflex wave and other problems. This paper proposes a new type of algorithm aimed at optimizing the fault location results by lightning location system record and traveling wave data. The suspected distance correspond to suspected reflex wave is assumed to be a kind of standard, so the nearest cloud-to-ground flash record is searched from all suspected fault locations calculated by suspected reflected surge from the fault point from measured data for removing the pseudo-root of fault location and finding the seemingly traveling wave fault location. According to the line direction of line corridor and the tendency of the nearest cloud-to-ground flash record, the space trend approach index of nearest cloud-to-ground flash record and tower is calculated, and the space trend approach index is used to optimize the traveling wave fault location result. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the measured traveling records. © 2016 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.",,20162002376446,,"Cao, Pulin (1); Shu, Hongchun (1); Ma, Yi (2); Huang, Ran (2); Dong, Jun (3); Chen, Nuo (1) ","(1) Faculty of Electric Power Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Electric Power Research Institute, Yunnan Power Grid Co.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy and principal component analysis were used to discriminate seven species of boletus belonging to the same genus. The results showed that the absorption bands of original spectra were similar, which were mainly composed of the absorption bands of protein and polysaccharides, but tiny differences were still observed at the position and intensities of peaks. Two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy technology was applied to study the sample. It showed that there are 6 auto-peaks in the Boletus brunneissimus Chiu and Boletus bicolor, 5 auto-peaks in the Boletus speciosus, 4 auto-peaks in the Boletus griseus Forst and Boletus calopus, only 3 in the Boletus edulis and Boletus aereus in the range of 1 680~1 300 cm-1. The significant differences in the position, intensity of auto-peaks and cross peaks were still observed in the range of 1 680~1 300 cm-1. Same significant differences were observed in the range of 1 150~920 cm-1. Principal component analysis was conducted on boletus with second derivative infrared spectra in the range of 1 800~800 cm-1. All the samples were distinguished and the classification accuracy of principal component analysis is up to 100%. It is demonstrated that Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combined with two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy or principal component analysis is a rapid and effective method for discriminating mushrooms. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Ecol. Indic.,"The availability of forage resources during the dry season is often a critical factor in determining the distribution and movement of large herbivores. It has long been suspected that the Kamala tree (Mallotus philippinensis) can serve as an indicator of the distribution for Asian elephants during the dry season in northwestern India. However, there is little direct evidence in support of this speculation, especially at a large landscape scale. Here, we predicted the distribution of Kamala trees in the Shivalik landscape of northwestern India based on topographic and bioclimatic variables, as well as satellite-derived vegetation indices and forest canopy height data using a presence-only ecological niche model. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS) to validate the model. We then examined the relationship between the occurrence probability of Kamala trees and the presence of Asian elephants with data collected during dry seasons between 2010 and 2014 using logistic regression models. Our results showed that the probability of occurrence of Kamala trees was predicted with good accuracy (AUC = 0.88 and TSS = 0.51). The logistic regression models showed that the presence of Asian elephants can be adequately predicted by the occurrence probability of Kamala trees. This result suggests that the distribution of Kamala trees is a good indicator of the presence of Asian elephants during the dry season in the Shivalik landscape. These findings may have major implications for the conservation of Asian elephants, especially in designing wildlife corridors and mitigating human-elephant conflicts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20163002634193,,"Bi, Yingfeng (1, 2, 3, 4); Roy, Arijit (3); Bhavsar, Dhruval (3); Xu, Jianchu (1, 6); Wang, Mingcheng (1, 6); Wang, Tiejun (5); Yang, Xuefei (1, 4) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650201, China (2) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (3) Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Indian Space Research Organization, Dehradun; 248 001, India (4) Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla, Yunnan; 666303, China (5) Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, University of Twente, Enschede; 7500 AE, Netherlands (6) World Agroforestry Centre, East and Central Asia, Kunming; 650201, China ",,444 Water Resources - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Animals - Drought - Probability - Regression analysis - Vegetation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Tiejun(t.wang@utwente.nl) ",10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.07.011,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: UN, Sponsor: United Nations; Number: 2015CASEABRIRG001, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","Yingfeng Bi gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Center for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific, Dehradun (affiliated to United Nations) .

IAENG Int. J. Comput. Sci.,"In recent years, many learning technologies have been applied in ontology similarity measuring and ontology mapping via learning an ontology function f: V ! R which maps an ontology graph to the real line. In these settings, all the information for an ontology vertex (corresponding to concept) is expressed as a vector. However, in a special application, the value of ontology function for each ontology vertex is determined by a few components of the vector. The aim of feature extraction for ontology vector is to obtain these components to fix the index set of the vector, and such a procedure is equivalent to learning an ontology sparse vector in which most components are zero. In this paper, we raise an ontology sparse vector learning model for ontology similarity measuring and ontology mapping in terms of SOCP. The balance term consists of-norm, and the directed acyclic graph is employed in ontology setting for backward and forward procedure. Then, the active index set algorithm is designed to moderate the value of p, thus applications will be extended. Finally, five experiments are presented on various fields to verify the efficiency of the new ontology algorithm for ontology similarity measuring and ontology mapping in multidisciplinary research.",,20161602246252,,"Lan, Meihui (1); Xu, Jian (1); Gao, Wei (2) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; 655011, China (2) School of Information and Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,"405.3 Surveying - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921.1 Algebra - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Directed graphs - Extraction - Feature extraction - Learning algorithms - Mapping - Vectors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18199224,,,,1819656X,1.0,"February 1, 2016",English,Ontology,,33.0,10-19,,2016,International Association of Engineers,IAENG International Journal of Computer Science,,Ontology feature extraction via vector learning algorithm and applied to similarity measuring and ontology mapping,,Directed acyclic graph (DAG) - Multi-disciplinary research - Ontology mapping - Second-order cone programming - Similarity measure - Similarity measuring - Sparse vectors - Special applications,43

Chemical indices introduced on these molecular topological structures can help chemists and material and medical scientists to grasp its chemical reactivity, biological activity, and physical features better. Hence, the study of the topological indices on the material structure can make up the defect of experiments and provide the theoretical evidence in material engineering.

J. Phys. Conf. Ser.,"Secular and/or cyclical orbital period variations of close binaries can be derived by analyzing the (O-C) diagram. The secular variations are usually explained as mass transfer between components, while the most plausible explanation of the cyclic period changes is the light-travel time effect (LTTE) through the presence of a third body. Mass transfer and additional companions in close binary systems are important for understanding the formation and evolution of the systems. Here, UV light curves of several close binaries based on the Lunar-based Ultraviolet Telescope (LUT) observations are presented and analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) method.

IEICE Trans Fund Electron Commun Comput Sci,"This paper proposes a deep quasi-linear kernel for support vector machines (SVMs). The deep quasi-linear kernel can be constructed by using a pre-trained deep neural network. To realize this goal, a multilayer gated bilinear classifier is first designed to mimic the functionality of the pre-trained deep neural network, by generating the gate control signals using the deep neural network. Then, a deep quasi-linear kernel is derived by applying an SVM formulation to the multilayer gated bilinear classifier. In this way, we are able to further implicitly optimize the parameters of the multilayer gated bilinear classifier, which are a set of duplicate but independent parameters of the pre-trained deep neural network, by using an SVM optimization. Experimental results on different data sets show that SVMs with the proposed deep quasi-linear kernel have an ability to take advantage of the pre-trained deep neural networks and outperform SVMs with RBF kernels.

Sci. Bull.,"Transiting extrasolar planets (exoplanets), especially those orbiting bright stars, are desired for study of the diversity of planetary compositions, internal structures and atmospheres beyond our solar system. Dome A at Antarctica is a promising site for planetary transit surveys, where the continuous darkness and the large clear-sky fraction in the winter months greatly enhance the detection efficiency. The Chinese Small Telescope ARray and the Antarctic Survey Telescopes are the first facilities that have been operated at Dome A for use in exoplanet surveys. To increase the sky coverage, a low-temperature-resistant wide-field robotic telescope, named the bright star survey telescope (BSST), has been developed to join the ongoing planetary transit survey in Antarctica. The BSST has an aperture size of 300 mm and is equipped with a large-frame (Formula presented.) CCD camera to receive starlight from a (Formula presented.) field of view. The BSST was operated at Lijiang observatory in April and May 2015 for a test run. Photometric precision of 3.5 mmag was achieved for stars with (Formula presented.) mag using 75 s exposures. The transiting events of two Jupiter-size exoplanets, HAT-P-3b and HAT-P-12b, were observed on May 10 and May 20, 2015, respectively. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Open Access,20160701910605,,"Tian, Qiguo (1); Jiang, Peng (1, 2); Du, Fujia (3); Wang, Jian (4); Li, Zhengyang (3); Li, Xiaoyan (3); Zhang, Zhiyong (3); Lu, Haiping (3); Yuan, Xiangyan (3); Liu, Huigen (2, 5); Zhang, Hui (2, 5); Sun, Luming (1, 6); Chang, Liang (7, 8); Wang, Jianguo (7, 8); Zhang, Shaohua (1); Ji, Tuo (1); Shi, Xiheng (1); Chen, Jie (4); Zhang, Guangyu (4); Jia, Minghao (4); Liu, Jiajing (4); Zhou, Junyan (1, 6); Pan, Xiang (1, 6); Dong, Shucheng (4); Jiang, Fengxin (4); Zhang, Hongfei (4); Zhou, Jilin (2, 5); Wang, Lifan (9); Zhou, Hongyan (1, 6) ","(1) Polar Research Institute of China, Shanghai; 200136, China (2) School of Astronomy and Space Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing; 210093, China (3) National Astronomical Observatories/Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing; 210042, China (4) State Key Laboratory of Technologies of Particle Detection and Electronics, Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; 230026, China (5) Key Laboratory of Modern Astronomy and Astrophysics (Nanjing University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing; 210093, China (6) Key Laboratory for Research in Galaxies and Cosmology, Department of Astronomy, University of Science and Technology of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei; 230026, China (7) National Astronomical Observatories/Yunnan Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China (8) Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China (9) Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science, Nanjing; 210008, China ",,408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements,,,,,CCD cameras - Domes - Extrasolar planets - Orbits - Photometry - Stars - Telescopes - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jiang, Peng(jpaty@mail.ustc.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11434-016-1015-0,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20959281,"Number: CHINARE2013-02-03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: CHI-NARE2015-02-03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: CHINARE2012-02-03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: CHINARE2014-02-03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: CX20130201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11033007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11503022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11203022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11473025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11573024, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11233002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11421303, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 15ZR1444200, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 14ZR1444100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; Number: 2013CB834905, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB857005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11503023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors appreciate the enlightening suggestions from the referees, which helped to improve the quality of this paper.

Mater Res Bull,"The red-emitting phosphors BaTiF6:Mn4+(denoted as BTFM) have been synthesized from HF, H2TiF6, Ba(OH)2and KMnO4mixed solution using a hydrothermal route. Their structure, composition and morphology were investigated. The photo-luminescent (PL) properties of the obtained BTFM products have been investigated, which exhibit broad excitation band in the blue region and sharp emission in the red region. In order to obtain the optimum BTFM red phosphor, many important factors of hydrothermal synthesis have been studied. The single red LED fabricated by combining BTFM with GaN chip shows intense red emission with the appropriate CIE chromaticity coordinates (x = 0.660, y = 0.312), and bright red light can be observed from the red LED. Therefore, this red phosphor may finds application in blue LED backlighting. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,20153501225188,,"Zhou, Yayun (1); Zhou, Qiang (1); Liu, Yong (1); Wang, Zhengliang (1); Yang, Hui (1); Wang, Qin (2) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Biopolymer Functional Materials of Yunnan, Key Laboratory of Comprehensive Utilization of Mineral Resources in Ethnic Regions, Key Laboratory of Resource Clean Conversion in Ethnic Regions, Education Department of Yunnan, School of Chemistry Environment, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",MRBUAC,714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Barium compounds - Fluorine compounds - Hydrofluoric acid - III-V semiconductors - Light emitting diodes - Luminescence - Manganese compounds - Optical properties - Phosphors - Potash - Titanium compounds - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Zhengliang(wangzhengliang@foxmail.com) ",10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.08.022,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014FB147, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 22014Y253, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2015TX01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guizhou Minzu University; Number: NSFC 21261027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 21261027 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2014FB147 ), Department of Yunnan Education ( 22014Y253 ), and the Special-zone Projection from Yunnan Minzu University (No. 2015TX01 ).",,00255408,,"January 31, 2016",English,Hydrothermal synthesis,,23.0,14-20,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Materials Research Bulletin,,Hydrothermal synthesis and luminescent properties of BaTiF6:Mn4+red phosphor for LED backlighting,,A.

IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst,"Numerical preference relations constitute a useful decision-making technique and can be classified into two types on the basis of the 0.1-0.9 and 1-9 scales. However, these numerical scales cannot fully describe some desired properties, such as asymmetry, consistency, variability, and diminishing utility, in accordance with the preference relations. To address this issue, we first develop a generalized sigmoid function and define a continuous preference set, on the basis of which we propose the generalized sigmoid scale. Then, we introduce the optimal discrete fitting and risk preference selection approaches to solve the risk appetite parameters in the generalized sigmoid scale. Using these new methods, we further propose the asymmetric fuzzy preference relation (AFPR), examine its additive transitivity property and some weak transitivity properties, and design an approximate consistency test. The corresponding five-step modeling process under an asymmetric fuzzy preference environment is constructed, which can be applied in decision making involving different risk appetites. Finally, two examples are used to demonstrate the properties and advantages of these new methods. The first example is simple and shows the differences between the traditional fuzzy preference relations and the AFPRs, while the second is a practical case and is used to illustrate the feasibility and reasonability of the AFPRs. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",,20162502512375,7289405.0,"Zhou, Wei (1); Xu, Zeshui (2) ","(1) Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (2) Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610064, China ",IEFSEV,723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 912.2 Management,,,,,Artificial intelligence - Fuzzy sets,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2486812,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10636706,3.0,June 2016,English,Decision making,,60.0,741-756,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,,Asymmetric Fuzzy Preference Relations Based on the Generalized Sigmoid Scale and Their Application in Decision Making Involving Risk Appetites,,Fuzzy preference relations - generalized sigmoid scale - optimal discrete fitting (ODF) - Risk preference - Sigmoid function,24
Solid Earth,"Riparian buffers can trap sediment and nutrients sourced from upper cropland, minimizing the eutrophication risk of water quality. This study aimed to investigate the distributions of soil inorganic phosphorus (Pi) forms among profile and particle-size fractions in an established riparian buffer and adjacent cropped area at the Dian lake, southwestern China. The Ca-bound fraction (62 %) was the major proportion of the Pi in the riparian soils. After 3 years' restoration, buffer rehabilitation from cropped area had a limited impact on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, but has contributed to a change in Pi forms. In the 0-20 cm soil layer, levels of the Olsen-P, non-occluded, Ca-bound, and total Pi were lower in the buffer than the cropped area; however, the Pi distribution between the cropped area and the buffer did not differ significantly as depth increased. The clay fraction corresponded to 57 % of TP and seemed to be both a sink for highly recalcitrant Pi and a source for labile Pi. The lower concentration of Pi forms in the silt and sand particle fraction in the surface soil was observed in the buffer area, which indicated that the Pi distribution in coarse particle fraction had sensitively responded to land use changes. © 2016 Author(s).",Open Access,20160902008476,,"Sheng Zhang, Guo (1); Cha Li, Jian (1) ","(1) Environmental Science and Ecological Rehabilitation, Institute of Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 445.2 Water Analysis - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Eutrophication - Lakes - Land use - Particle size - Phosphorus - Water quality,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Sheng Zhang, Guo(gshzhang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.5194/se-7-301-2016,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18699529,"Number: 2012ZX07102-003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31060085, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from NSFC (31060085) and National Key Sciences and Technology Program for Water Solutions (2012ZX07102-003).,,18699510,1.0,"February 19, 2016",English,Soils,,45.0,301-310,,2016,Copernicus GmbH,Solid Earth,,Distribution of inorganic phosphorus in profiles and particle fractions of Anthrosols across an established riparian buffer and adjacent cropped area at the Dian lake (China),,Clay fractions - Coarse particles - Inorganic phosphorus - Land-use change - Particle fraction - Particle-size fractions - Riparian buffers - Total phosphorus,7
Environ. Sci. Technol.,"Little is understood regarding the effects of mixtures of different metal-based nanoparticles (NPs). Using concentration-addition (CA) and independent-action (IA) models, we evaluated the combined toxicity of Cu and ZnO NPs based on five nested combinations, i.e., Cu(NO3)2-CuNPs, Zn(NO3)2-ZnONPs, Cu(NO3)2-ZnONPs, Zn(NO3)2-CuNPs, and CuNPs-ZnONPs on root elongation of Lactuca sativa L. The CA and IA models performed equally well in estimating the toxicity of mixtures of Cu(NO3)2-CuNPs, Zn(NO3)2-ZnONPs, and Zn(NO3)2-CuNPs, whereas the IA model was significantly better for fitting the data of Cu(NO3)2-ZnONPs and CuNPs-ZnONPs mixtures. Dissolved Cu proved to be the most toxic metal species to lettuce roots in the tests, followed by Cu NPs, dissolved Zn, and ZnO NPs, respectively. An antagonistic effect was observed for ZnO NPs on the toxicity of Cu NPs. This antagonistic effect is expected to be the result of interactions between dissolved Cu and dissolved Zn, particulate Zn and dissolved Zn, particulate Cu and dissolved Zn, and between particulate Zn and dissolved Cu. In general terms, assuming additivity gives a first indication of the combined toxicity with soluble and insoluble metal particles, both being important in driving the toxicity of metal-based NPs to higher plants. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,20162202437236,,"Liu, Yang (1, 2); Baas, Jan (2, 3); Peijnenburg, Willie J.

Wuli Xuebao,"Cavity-optomechanics has emerged as a new interdisciplinary research field, which studies the interaction between light field and mechanical systems of micro-and nanoscale. It is a promising avenue to solid-state quantum optics and has potential applications in high sensitivity measurement of weak force, tiny displacement and mass, and quantum information science. As a solid-state system of quantum optics, it has many interesting coherent phenomena, such as optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), which is the optomechanical analog of the well-known phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, due to diversity in structure, OMIT systems must have many new phenomena which do not exist in ordinary EIT systems. On the other hand, whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonators have been investigated extensively. WGM microresonators have a wide range of applications due to their high quality factors and microscale mode volumes. WGM microresonators can also be used for OMIT systems, which have been investigated extensively. In this paper, we study the coherent control of an double-cavity optomechanical system which is composed of two WGM microresonators. We assume that the two WGM microcavties are driven by two strong control fields and two weak probe fields, and, one of the two cavities can create a macroscopic mechanical breathing mode under the action of a radiation pressure force. We also assume that the two WGM microcavties are directly coupled by an evanescent field. We theoretically study the quantum coherent control of electromagnetically induced transparency in this system, and find that in contrast with ordinary EIT systems, there are many new properties in this OMIT system, for example if two control fields with appropriate amplitudes and detunings are used to drive the system, the probe field, which is input to one of the two cavities, will be completely output from the other cavity, i. e., the perfect transparency of the quantum coherence phenomenon can occur in this system. We also find that the electromagnetically induced transparency can be realized and controlled in this optomechanical system by adjusting the relative intensity and the relative phase between the two input probe fields, and the width and depth of the EIT window are sensitive to the relative intensity of the two control fields, which may be used for switching between fast and slow light. These results indicate important progress toward signal amplification, light storage, fast light, and slow light in quantum information processes. Considering the fact that WGM microresonators are the frontier research subjects ranging from biosensing, nonlinear optics, and laser physics, to fundamental physics such as cavity quantum electrodynamics, we believe that the results in this paper have a wide range of applications. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.",,20164603020754,214204.0,"Lu, He-Lin (1, 2); Du, Chun-Guang (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Low-dimensional Quantum Physics and Department of Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing; 100084, China (2) Department of Physics, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650031, China ",WLHPAR,701 Electricity and Magnetism - 714.3 Waveguides - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics,,,,,Electrodynamics - Evanescent fields - Light - Optical resonators - Probes - Quantum electronics - Quantum optics - Slow light - Transparency,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Du, Chun-Guang(ducg@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn) ",10.7498/aps.65.214204,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 91221205, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11274197, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11274197, 91221205).",,10003290,21.0,"November 5, 2016",Chinese,Whispering gallery modes,,26.0,,,2016,"Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica,,Coherent control of whispering-gallery-mode optomechanical microresonators and perfect transparency,,Cavity optomechanics - Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics - Electromagnetically-induced transparency - High sensitivity measurement - Interdisciplinary research - Optomechanically induced transparencies - Quantum information process - Quantum information science,65
Huagong Jinzhan/Chem. Ind. Eng. Prog.,"Based on image processing technology and chaos theory, a novel method for quantitative characterization of gas jet images was proposed,which reflects the mixing performance. The Otsu method was used to find the best threshold value and hence the best segmented images. The mixing performance(M) is defined as the ratio of proportion of gas jet pixels(W) to standard deviation of the grayscale values in gas jet region(N) for characterizing spatial distribution of gas jet. Unsteady motions of the gas jet were characterized by the nonlinear time series of the mixing performances. As have shown,the stability of gas jet(1/V) decrease with the increasing modified Froude number under jetting regime,which confirms the validity of our approach. On top of that,the linear relation between stability and largest Lyapunov exponent(LLE) was obvious with a correlation coefficient of 0.954. For further research a linear model of stability and LLE were constructed. The results showed that the LLE can not only judge the mixing process is nonchaotic or chaotic,also the numerical size of LLE reflected the stability of gas jet. © 2016, Chemical Industry Press.

J Rare Earth,"A series of Ba5Si8O21:0.02Eu2+,0.09RE3+persistent phosphors were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The measurement results of photoluminescence (PL), phosphorescence and thermoluminescence (TL) were analysed and discussed. The XRD results showed that samples codoped with different RE3+were Ba5Si8O21single pure phase. Under the excitation, all samples exhibited a broad Eu2+characteristic emission, and the La3+co-doped sample emitted the brightest photoluminescence even though its persistent luminescence property was the worst because of the weakest electronegativity. However, Nd3+electronegativity was suitable, thus after activation, the Ba5Si8O21:Eu2+,Nd3+sample had the best persistent luminescence performance with the highest phosphorescence intensity and the persistent luminescence decay time beyond 8 h. The Nd3+co-doped sample also had the largest thermoluminescence integral area which proved effectively it had longer persistent luminescence time. The luminescence mechanism was also proposed to study the photoluminescence and persistent luminescence process. These results showed that RE3+electronegativities were distinctly important for persistent phosphors and choosing suitable electronegativity codopant was conducive to enhancing the phosphorescent performance. © 2016 The Chinese Society of Rare Earths.",,20162102418986,,"Dong, Zhiliang (1); Qin, Yi (1); Yang, Yong (1, 2); Zhou, Dacheng (1, 2); Xu, Xuhui (1, 2); Qiu, Jianbei (1) ","(1) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650093, China ",JREAE6,741.1 Light/Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Barium compounds - Chemical bonds - Doping (additives) - Electronegativity - Luminescence - Luminescence of inorganic solids - Phosphorescence - Phosphors - Photoluminescence - Rare earths - Solid state reactions - Thermoluminescence,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Qiu, Jianbei(qiu@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/S1002-0721(16)60048-0,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51272097, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61265004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61265004, 51272097) and the Foundation of Application Research of Yunnan Province, China (2011FB022)",,10020721,5.0,"May 1, 2016",English,Silicon compounds,,25.0,453-457,,2016,Chinese Society of Rare Earths,Journal of Rare Earths,,Effect of RE3+electronegativities on luminescence property of Ba5Si8O21:Eu2+persistent phosphor,,Ba5Si8O21 - Characteristic emission - Integral areas - Luminescence mechanisms - Luminescence properties - Persistent luminescence - Phosphorescence intensity - Solid state reaction method,34

Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"It is difficult to make dispatch decisions of power systems when large-scale small hydropower (SHP) connected to the power grid because of randomness and unpredictability characters of SHP. Regarding the uncertainty characters of large-scale SHP, this paper used a scenario analysis method, which is a method of stochastic programming theory, to construct power scenario set for description power characteristics of SHP. And fuzzy clustering and clustering comprehensive quality algorithm were proposed for reduction scenarios while establishment the conditional probability distribution of forecast and actual power under the current prediction accuracy. SHP uncertainty problem was transformed into a deterministic finite condition scenarios problem. An expectancy model for peak shaving operation was established of SHP and large hydropower (LHP) system. The similarity was analyzed between the current forecast power and prediction scenarios in order to discriminate prediction scene category and obtain possible actual scenarios in the future. Then a successive search algorithm was proposed to solve the model. The proposed method was applied to the dispatching center of Yunnan Electric Power Dispatching Center for generation scheduling between small and large hydropower plants.

J. Org. Chem.,"α,β-Unsaturated ynones have historically been used as Michael acceptors in conjugate addition reactions. Herein, we have demonstrated for the first time that ynones can be harnessed as Michael donors for use in catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition reactions by strategically introducing a CO2t-Bu group as a multitasking directing group. Furthermore, this concept has enabled designer ynones as versatile synthetic equivalents of both α′ anions of ynones and γ monoanions of 1,3-diketones, which are synthetically valued but difficult to generate. The first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of ynones as Michael donors has been realized in good yields with high enantioselectivities. A unified approach to regiospecifically and chemo- and enantioselectively access hitherto elusive γ-Michael adducts of 1,3-diketones has been achieved in a divergent manner.

Int. J. Environ. Anal. Chem.,"Utilising the affinity and high combination ability between silver nanocubes and amino group (–NH2), a novel electrochemical immunosensor was constructed for the ultrasensitive detection of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) based on G4-polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer and Ag nanocubes as immobilised substrate of anti-MC-LR. G4-PAMAM dendrimers were covalently bound on the chitosan (CHIT) – modified electrode by glutaraldehyde (GA), providing abundant amino groups to absorb much more Ag nanocubes comparing without using PAMAM. Subsequently, antibodies of MC-LR were immobilised with highly dense through Ag-NH2. K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6was used as electroactive redox probe. Ag nanocubes/PAMAM can enhance the antibody loading amount, which would bind more MC-LR and hinder the electron transfer of K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was employed to evaluate the analytical performance of the fabricated signal-off immunosensor. The response current had negative correlation with the concentration of MC-LR. The linear range covered was from 0.05 ng/mL to 25 μg/mL with detection limit (DL) of 0.017 ng/mL at 3σ. The proposed approach showed high specificity for the detection of MC-LR, with acceptable reproducibility, stability and reliability. Compared with the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) method by analyzing real water samples from Dian Lake, this immunosensor revealed acceptable accuracy with a relative error of 12.7%, indicating a potential alternative method for MC-LR detection in water sample. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,20160902019692,,"Fu, Xuewen (1); Zhao, Chunling (1); Liu, Xiaohai (2); Zhao, Jinhang (1); Niu, Xiaofang (1); Zheng, Li (1); Yang, Yunhui (1) ","(1) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China (2) Environmental Analysis and Testing Center, Yunnan Institute of Environmental Science, Kunming, China ",IJEAC5,461.9.1 Immunology - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry,,,,,Antibodies - Dendrimers - Immunosensors - Voltammetry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Yunhui(yyhui2002@aliyun.com) ",10.1080/03067319.2016.1150460,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10290397,"Number: 21465026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21165023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 21165023, 21465026].",,03067319,3.0,"February 19, 2016",English,Toxic materials,,42.0,284-297,,2016,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry,,A layer-by-layer assembly label-free electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of microcystin-LR based on CHIT/PAMAM dendrimer/silver nanocubes,,Differential pulse voltammetry - Electrochemical immunosensors - Enzyme linked immunoassays - Label-free immunosensor - Microcystins - Polyamidoamine dendrimers - Silver nanocubes - Stability and reliabilities,96
J. Hydrol.,"Spring discharge often responds to rainfall with a rapid increase followed by a slower recession, and the mode of recession is often exponential-like. We propose a new model of the response of spring discharge to rainfall based on the square law for turbulent conduit flow. The new non-exponential model is compared against the exponential model under specific constraints. A hydrograph of St. Marks River in Florida is used to illustrate that when the change in “sinkhole head” (defined as the hydraulic head at the upstream end of the karst conduit connected to the spring) is relatively small, the solution of the new model is close to that of the exponential model, which extends the validity and application of the exponential solution. When the change in sinkhole head is very large, the solutions from the two models clearly differ from each other. Limitations of the non-exponential model are analyzed by simulation of a hydrograph observed downstream of Wakulla Springs. It is concluded that both solutions are applicable when spring response is smaller than or comparable to the base flow, but are nonphysical when the response is much larger than the base discharge. © 2016",,20164603017862,,"Li, Guangquan (1); Goldscheider, Nico (2); Field, Malcolm S.

"IEEE CITS - Int. Conf. Comput., Inf. Telecommun. Syst.","Spatial co-location patterns represent the subsets of Boolean spatial features, and the instances of the pattern are frequently located together in a geographic space. Most existing co-location pattern mining methods mainly focus on whether spatial feature instances are frequently located together. However, that the occurrence of neighbor relationships is in the whole space or local area is not considered. In this paper, a new measurement using an evenness coefficient of the feature distribution is introduced, and a novel algorithm for co-location pattern mining is proposed, which takes into account the prevalence of the spatial feature and the spatial distribution characteristics of feature instances. Furthermore, some key techniques are presented, including region partition and count of row instances in this algorithm. The experimental evaluation with both synthetic data sets and a real world data set shows that the algorithm can discover prevalent and evenly distributional co-location patterns, and the number of the result set is effectively reduced compare to the traditional mined results. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163802815360,7546446.0,"Zhao, Jiasong (1, 2); Wang, Lizhen (1); Bao, Xuguang (1); Tan, Yaqing (2) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Basic Science and Information Engineering, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics,123384.0,"July 6, 2016 - July 8, 2016","Kunming, China","2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, CITS 2016",Data mining - Location,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Lizhen(lzhwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1109/CITS.2016.7546446,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61262069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61472346, No.61262069).",9781509034406.0,,,"August 16, 2016",English,Spatial distribution,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",11.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks (ISN); Xidian University; Yunnan Minzu University,Mining co-location patterns with spatial distribution characteristics,,Co-location patterns - Distribution characteristics - Evenness coefficient - Participation index - Spatial data mining,
Anal. Methods,"Thrombin, a kind of serine protease, is a significant regulator of thrombosis in vivo. Herein, we proposed a label-free and sensitive fluorescence assay for probing thrombin activity based on an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) probe and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The EGFP probe containing a hexahistidine sequence (His-tag) and a thrombin recognition site at the N-terminal was designed. His-tag enables the probe to be adsorbed on the surface of AuNPs through high affinity of His-Au bonds, and as a consequence, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) would happen, where EGFP is the fluorescence donor and AuNPs are the acceptors. Because of the high extinction coefficient of AuNPs, the fluorescence of EGFP will be quenched. When there is thrombin, it cleaves the recognition site, and results in the leaving of the His-tag from EGFP. EGFP without the His-tag cannot be efficiently adhered on AuNPs, and its fluorescence is protected. Thus, the corresponding fluorescence signal can respond to the activity of thrombin. Using this turn-on fluorescence assay, we obtained a highly sensitive and specific detection of thrombin activity (limit of detection = 0.0025 U mL-1) with a linear range from 0.01 U mL-1to 0.25 U mL-1under optimized conditions. The assay can also be used to measure the inhibition of thrombin activity (where hirudin was used as an example) with an IC50value of 1.38 nM, and this was successfully performed on real samples. Furthermore, the proposed assay has the potential to be a fluorescence-colorimetry dual detection method. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20162402504100,,"Jin, Xin (1); Liu, Xin (2); Zhu, Xiaohua (1); Li, Hao (1); Li, Wang (1); Huang, Yan (1); Yao, Shouzhuo (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha; 410082, China (2) Technology Center, China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial Co., Ltd, Kunming, China ",,741.1.2 Fiber Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Amino acids - Energy transfer - Fiber optic sensors - Forster resonance energy transfer - Gold nanoparticles - Metal nanoparticles - Probes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Yan(huangyan.hnu@gmail.com) ",10.1039/c6ay00290k,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17599679,"Number: 21221003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21175036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21475037, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21190044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21222507, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the 973 Program (No. 2011CB911002), the NSFC (No. 21475037, 21190044, 45, 21222507, and 21175036), the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of NSFC (Grant 21221003), and the fundamental research funds for the central universities.",,17599660,18.0,"May 14, 2016",English,Enzymes,,38.0,3691-3697,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,Analytical Methods,,A label-free fluorescence assay for thrombin activity analysis based on fluorescent protein and gold nanoparticles,,Enhanced green fluorescent protein - Fluorescence assay - Fluorescence signals - Fluorescent protein - High extinction coefficients - Limit of detection - Optimized conditions - Specific detection,8
RSC Adv.,"Pursuit of robust electrocatalysts has been a persistent objective for hydrogen evolution from seawater. We present here an experimental realization of an efficient Co3Mo3C decorated carbon nanotube (Co3Mo3C/CNT) electrocatalyst with exceptionally high electrocatalytic activity and good durability through a simple thermal decomposition method for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yielding an onset overpotential as low as 42 mV and an exchange current density up to 0.415 mA cm-2in seawater. Notably, the resultant Co3Mo3C/CNT electrocatalyst displays a promising stability when suffering persistent operation over 26 h in seawater. In comparison with pristine Ni foam electrode, the Co3Mo3C/CNT can markedly reduce the overpotential for hydrogen evolution and therefore enhance HER kinetics. ©2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20164202910067,,"Zhao, Yuanyuan (1); Tang, Qunwei (1); He, Benlin (1); Yang, Peizhi (2) ","(1) Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao; 266100, China (2) Key Laboratory of Advanced Technique and Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",RSCACL,"471.4 Seawater, Tides and Waves - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 819.4 Fiber Products",,,,,Carbides - Carbon nanotubes - Decomposition - Hydrogen - Seawater - Yarn,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Qunwei(tangqunwei@ouc.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6ra17839a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 05300205020516009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1037604, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21503202, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge financial supports from National Natural Science Foundation of China (21503202, U1037604), and Collaborative Innovation Center of Research and Development of Renewable Energy in the Southwest Area (05300205020516009).",,,96.0,2016,English,Electrocatalysts,,57.0,93267-93274,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Carbide decorated carbon nanotube electrocatalyst for high-efficiency hydrogen evolution from seawater,,Electrocatalytic activity - Exchange current densities - Experimental realizations - Good durability - High-efficiency - Hydrogen evolution - Hydrogen evolution reactions - Thermal decomposition methods,6
Dianzi Yu Xinxi Xuebao,"In wireless communication network, the channel state information is complicated. A joint Hierarchical Modulation and Physical-layer Network Coding (HM-PNC) scheme is proposed for the asymmetric Two-Way Relay Channel (TWRC). In this scheme, the two source nodes and the relay node adopt the hierarchical modulation technology (2/4-PSK). In the relay node, a special demodulation/modulation and PNC mapping rule is designed. Corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), the relay Bit Error Ratio (BER) and the end-to-end BER expressions are derived. Simulation results show that the HM-PNC scheme not only improves the data rate in better links, but also takes into account the transmission reliability of the poor channels. Compared with the traditional QPSK-PNC scheme, the HM-PNC scheme has better mobile performance. © 2016, Science Press.

A high gain can be realized by loading of T-shaped array of metamaterial elements and using a rectangular box-shaped reflector. Simulated results show that this antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth of 58.5%, ranging from 2.32 GHz to 4.24 GHz and a high gain about 8 dB. Moreover, radiation patterns with low back radiation, fixing broadside direction mainbeam, symmetrical E- and H-plane patterns and large front-to-back ratio are obtained over the whole operating band by using a rectangular box-shaped reflector.

Pattern Recogn.,"This paper reports a novel data-driven facial animation technique which drives a neutral source face to get the expressive target face using a semi-supervised local patch alignment framework. We define the local patch and assume that there exists a linear transformation between a patch of the target face and the intrinsic embedding of the corresponding patch of the source face. Based on this assumption, we compute the intrinsic embeddings of source patches and align these embeddings to form the result. During the course of alignment, we use a set of motion data as shape regularizer to impel the result to approach the unknown target face. The intrinsic embedding can be computed through both locally linear embedding and local tangent space alignment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can obtain decent face driving results. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the proposed framework demonstrate its superiority to existing methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20161402201536,,"Zhang, Jian (1); Yu, Jun (2); You, Jane (3); Tao, Dapeng (4); Li, Na (1); Cheng, Jun (5) ","(1) School of Science and Technology, Zhejiang International Studies University, Hangzhou; 310012, China (2) Key Laboratory of Complex Systems Modeling and Simulation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, School of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou; 310018, China (3) Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hongkong, Hong Kong (4) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (5) Key Laboratory of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen; 518055, China ",PTNRA8,"722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations",,,,,Animation - Digital storage - Mathematical transformations,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Jun(yujun@hdu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.patcog.2016.02.021,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Science and Technology of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese University of Hong Kong; ","No conflict of interest.

Furthermore, preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity experiments on human colon cancer cell lines HT-29, SW480, HCT116, and DLD-1 were also performed, and the complexes showed remarkable anticancer activity against HT-29, SW480, and HCT116. These results suggested that the inclusion complexes would be potentially useful for applications for human colon cancer chemotherapy. © 2016 Published by NRC Research Press.",,20162602539818,,"Guo, Yafei (1, 3); Li, Jiuling (1); Liu, Yuqi (3); Ma, Yongping (3); Cheng, Huilin (2); Yang, Bo (1); Liu, Dandan (2); Yang, Rui (3) ","(1) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pharmacology for Natural Products, Kunming Medical University, Yunnan; 650500, China (3) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",CJCHAG,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Binary alloys - Cell culture - Chemotherapy - Diseases - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Bo(yangbo6910@sina.com) ",10.1139/cjc-2015-0462,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: KKSY201207140, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21362016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015G005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 21362016), the Science and Technology Planning Project of Yunnan Province (No. KKSY201207140), and the Open Research Foundation of Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pharmacology for Nature Products (No. 2015G005), which are gratefully acknowledged.",,00084042,6.0,2016,English,Cyclodextrins,,27.0,575-582,,2016,Canadian Science Publishing,Canadian Journal of Chemistry,,"Inclusion complexes of anhydrolycorine with cyclodextrins: Preparation, characterization, and anticancer activity",,2D-NMR spectroscopy - Anhydrolycorine - Anticancer activities - Human colon cancer - Human colon cancer cells - Inclusion complex - Inclusion complexation - Water solubilities,94
Knowl Based Syst,"To contain the competitive influence spread in social networks is to maximize the influence of one participant and contain the influence of its opponent. It is desirable to develop effective strategies for influence spread of the participants themselves instead of blocking the influence spread of their opponents. In this paper, we extend the linear threshold model to establish the diffusion-containment model, abbreviated as D-C model, by incorporating the realistic specialties and characteristics of the containment of competitive influence spread. Then, we discuss the influence spread mechanism for the D-C model, and give the algorithm for the propagation of the diffusion influence (D-influence) and containment influence (C-influence). Further, we define the sub-modular set function of the C-influence in the D-C model and consequently give a greedy algorithm for solving the problem of maximizing the competitive influence containment approximately. Experimental results show the feasibility of our method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20163002643331,,"Liu, Weiyi (1); Yue, Kun (1); Wu, Hong (1); Li, Jin (2); Liu, Donghua (1); Tang, Duanping (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",KNSYET,971 Social Sciences,,,,,Diffusion,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yue, Kun(kyue@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.knosys.2016.07.008,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: XT412011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: 2012HB004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 2014FA028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FB110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: XT412003, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61402398, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61562091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472345, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61472345, 61562091, 61402398), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2014FA023, 2014FA028, 2016FB110), Yunnan Provincial Foundation for Leaders of Disciplines in Science and Technology (No. 2012HB004), Program for Innovative Research Team in Yunnan University (No. XT412011), and Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University (No. XT412003).",,09507051,,"October 1, 2016",English,Economic and social effects,,31.0,266-275,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Knowledge-Based Systems,,Containment of competitive influence spread in social networks,,Competitive influence spread - Containment model - Greedy algorithms - Influence containment - Linear threshold models - Sub-modularity,109
Nanoscale,"Transformation of aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules into functional materials can greatly tune their fluorescence properties and expand their related potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence properties of AIE molecules by confining them within the nanochannels of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). AIE molecules (4,4′-(hydrazine-1,2-diylidene bis(methanylylidene)) bis(3-hydroxybenzoic acid), HDBB) with pH-dependent emission were successfully integrated into UiO-66 resulting in a UiO-66⊃HDBB complex while maintaining the crystal structure by the host-guest process. The fluorescence properties of HDBB can be modulated by virtue of the unique nanospace confining effect. Furthermore, UiO-66⊃HDBB was used as a sensitive and selective fluorescent probe for Cu2+detection in aqueous solution. This study provides a facile strategy for the construction of high performance AIE based luminescent materials with adjustable properties for potential applications.

J Electroanal Chem,"In this work, an amperometric sensor was developed for the selective recognition and sensitive determination of palladium in complex matrices using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with a novel ion-imprinted membrane (IIM) and graphene. Graphene enhanced the sensor's electron transfer and sensitivity. The electrode surface was first directly modified with graphene through the electrodeposition of graphene oxide. An ion-imprinted polymer membrane was subsequently synthesized on this modified surface via in situ polymerization in acetonitrile using allylurea (NAU) as a functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linking agent, and azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator at a molar ratio of template (PdCl2) to NAU to EGDMA of 1:4:40. Amperometric i-t curves were measured for the determination of palladium. The designed modified electrode was shown a linear response to Pd(II) ions in the range of 2.0 × 10-8-2.0 × 10-4mol L-1of Pd(II) ion with a detection limit of 6.4 × 10-9mol L-1. Metal ions present at concentrations 15 times higher than that of Pd(II) did not interfere with the determination of Pd(II). The sensor was successfully applied to determine palladium in catalyst and plant samples with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 3.3% (n = 5) and recoveries in the range of 99.2-106.5%.

Appl Therm Eng,"In the vertical Bridgman system for multicrystalline silicon vacuum directional solidification process, the radiation heat transfer characteristics have a significant impact on the quality of crystal growth. In this paper, the effect of heat transfer characteristics under different pulling-down rates on the vacuum directional solidification process was investigated. Simplified radiation view factor dependent on pulling-down rate in pilot-scale vertical Bridgman system was derived. Combined with the transient simulation results, we obtained the heat transfer characteristics inside the furnace, and proposed the optimization scheme by using a rate of slowly first and then faster to pull down the crucible, which can not only satisfy thermal conditions of crystal growth, but also shorten the solidification time and effectively reduce the energy consumption. In addition, according to the characteristics of the radiative heat transfer under vacuum condition and the change of view factor, it was found that an improved design by widening the cold zone of the furnace can narrow the temperature gradient in the silicon ingot, and greatly decrease the thermal stresses, which in turn can aid in the design of future industrial equipment and process improvements. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J. Appl. Polym. Sci.,"The acid-catalyzed urea–formaldehyde reactions were reexamined in detail by using quantum chemistry method and13C-NMR determinations. Some issues in the synthesis theory that were not well understood previously have been addressed and clarified. The identified reaction mechanisms and calculated energy barriers suggest that the competitive formations of methylene and methylene ether linkages are kinetically affected by both reaction energy barriers and steric hindrance effect. The thermodynamic properties determine that the methylene linkages are dominant at the late condensation stage. The theoretical results well rationalized the observed different changing processes of resin structures with different F/U molar ratios. The previously proposed mechanism for transformation of methylene ether linkage to methylene linkage cannot explain the structural changes during condensation, and thus, other mechanisms were proposed. The calculated results for uron explained the fact that the formation of such structure is much slower than other structures under weak acidic condition. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

Water Sci. Technol.,"Although rhizoremediation is an effective approach to remove organic pollutants from the environment, little is known about the mechanism of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) biodegradation in water. In this study, we used Typha angustifolia (T. angustifolia) grown in sterile Hoagland nutrient solution to determine the rhizosphere effects on the ability of bacteria in water to reduce HCB levels. The results revealed that T. angustifolia could facilitate HCB degradation and that the initial HCB concentration was the major factor responsible for HCB degradation in nutrient solution. Furthermore, HCB biodegradation in low-HCB nutrient solution with T. angustifolia fitted the firstorder kinetics, owing to the high concentration of total organic carbon, low HCB toxicity, and unique bacterial community in the T. angustifolia rhizosphere. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that the rhizosphere effects and different dosages of HCB have significant effects on the bacterial communities by repressing and favoring certain populations. The most successful bacteria to adapt to HCB contamination was Bacillus sp., while the dominant bacterial phyla in HCB-polluted water were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. © IWA Publishing 2016.",,20164002876868,,"Wang, Bei (1, 2); Zhang, Cuiping (1); Li, Shuying (1); Lu, Guangqiu (1); Lu, Guoli (1); Li, Song (1); Zhou, Yuanqing (1) ","(1) Research Center for Pollution Control and Ecological Restoration, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi; 653100, China (2) Institute of Ecology and Geobotany, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",WSTED4,445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 453 Water Pollution - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Bacteria - Bacteriology - Biodegradation - Electrophoresis - Fungicides - Nutrients - Organic carbon - Organic pollutants - Polymerase chain reaction - Soils - Water pollution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Yuanqing(yqzhou@yxnu.net) ",10.2166/wst.2016.313,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014Z148, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31460144, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 31460144) and the Key Projects in Yunnan Province Department of Education (grant No. 2014Z148).,,02731223,6,September 2016,English,Water treatment,,26.0,1409-1416,,2016,"IWA Publishing, 12 Caxton Street, London, SW1H 0QS, United Kingdom",Water Science and Technology,,An approach to biodegradation of chlorobenzenes: Combination of Typha angustifolia and bacterial effects on hexachlorobenzene degradation in water,,Bacterial community - Denaturing gradient gel electrophoreses (DGGE) - Effective approaches - First order kinetics - Hexachlorobenzene - Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis - Rhizoremediation - Total Organic Carbon,74
Comput. Fluids,"Flow around two foils of different sizes is investigated by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations numerically with a space-time finite element method to study the swimming performance and vorticity structures of a mother-calf pair of fish. Based on simulations over a wide range of the relative position, Reynolds number, phase difference and phase velocity between the foils, we discuss in detail the drag coefficient, hydrodynamic power, root-mean-square value of the lift, and vorticity structures. It is found that both the mother and calf fish benefit in tandem and staggered arrangements. By changing their phase difference and phase velocity, the fish can get better performance in terms of thrust increase and hydrodynamic power saving. The mechanism of these strategies which are used to improve the performance is enhancing a reverse Kármán street or diminishing a Kármán street. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,20154401478252,,"Tian, Fang-Bao (1); Wang, Wenquan (1, 2); Wu, Jian (3); Sui, Yi (4) ","(1) School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra; ACT; 2600, Australia (2) Department of Engineering Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650051, China (3) Institut PPRIME, Département Fluide-Thermique-Combustion Boulevard Pierre et Marie Curie, BP 30179, Futuroscope-Chasseneuil; 86962, France (4) School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London, London; E1 4NS, United Kingdom ",CPFLBI,"631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 921.2 Calculus - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,Drag - Fish - Hydrodynamics - Navier Stokes equations - Phase velocity - Reynolds number - Vorticity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tian, Fang-Bao(f.tian@adfa.edu.au) ",10.1016/j.compfluid.2015.10.006,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: AEI, Sponsor: Australian Education International, Australian Government; Number: 2015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: DP130103850, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NCI, Sponsor: National Computational Infrastructure; ",This research was partially supported by the UNSW’s Early Career Researcher Grants Scheme 2015 and the Australian Research Council’s Discovery Project Funding Scheme (project number DP130103850 ).

Energy,"In this study, we investigated the exergetic efficiency and thermal energy source of the off-gas system of a submerged arc furnace, which varied from 27% to 35% and 47% to 55%, respectively, of the total energy supply. We used a case study to evaluate the thermal exergy in the off-gas of a real furnace, which exhibited an additional power capacity up to 2.7 MW amounting to 10% of the total energy supplied to the process (or 23% of the electrical power fed to the furnace.) We also determined the perfect negative correlation coefficients (r as the standard) between the exergetic efficiency and raw material consumption via linear regression and observed moderately positive relevance between power consumption and raw material consumption in the furnace. We attributed this correlation to increased graphitization and reduced resistivity of carbonaceous materials as the charging began sink slowly into the reaction zone and the charging temperature increased. Compared to coal, petroleum coke showed a significant impact on total power consumption according to the linear regression results; especially in regards to the fact that petroleum coke underwent graphitization more easily than coal as charging temperature increased. © 2016",,20164302926847,,"Chen, Zhengjie (1, 2, 3); Ma, Wenhui (1, 2, 3); Wu, Jijun (1, 2, 3); Wei, Kuixian (1, 2, 3); Yang, Xi (1, 2, 3); Lv, Guoqiang (1, 2, 3); Xie, Keqiang (1, 2, 3); Yu, Jie (1, 2, 3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Cleaning Utilization in Yunnan Province/The National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Non-Ferrous Metals Vacuum Metallurgy of Yunnan Province/Engineering Research Center for Silicon Metallurgy and Silicon Materials of Yunnan Provincial Universities, Kunming; 650093, China ",ENEYDS,513.3 Petroleum Products - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 802.2 Chemical Reactions,,,,,Electric power utilization - Furnaces - Graphite - Graphitization - Petroleum coke - Silicon,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ma, Wenhui(mwhsilicon@126.com) ",10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.034,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: IRT1250, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51334002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51461027, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors are grateful for financial support from the NSFC (No. 51334002 and No. 51461027 ) and the Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. IRT1250 ).,,03605442,,"December 1, 2016",English,Energy efficiency,,42.0,687-693,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Energy,,Influence of carbothermic reduction on submerged arc furnace energy efficiency during silicon production,,Carbonaceous materials - Correlation coefficient - Exergetic efficiency - Negative correlation - Raw material consumption - Reductants - Submerged arc furnace - Total power consumption,116

Particularly, the green UC emission intensity band centered at 543 nm was strongly increased twice with the increase of Li+up tp 4 mol%. Therefore, the Stokes emission results showed that the incorporation of Li+ions into the NaYF4:Eu3+lattice could induce a remarkable change of the Stokes emission intensity in red region (R = IED/IMD) with 393 nm excitation wavelength.

Ore Geol. Rev.,"The recently discovered Guanfang large W deposit, in Yunnan Province, southwest China, is located in the Diandongnan thrust-nappe fold belt in the western part of the Cathaysia Block. The orebodies occur at the contacts between the Suozuodi granite and Middle Cambrian marbles. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of the ore-bearing Suozuodi granite yields a crystallization age of 91.6 ± 1.0 Ma (MSWD = 0.56). An isochron age of 91.6 ± 1.3 Ma (MSWD = 0.24) was obtained by Re-Os dationg of five molybdenite samples separated from sulfide-bearing ores. Scheelite at the Guanfang deposit is characterized by broad rangs of Pb isotopic ratios (207Pb/204Pb = 15.568 to 15.735,206Pb/204Pb = 17.912 to 18.390,208Pb/204Pb = 38.491 to 38.730) and high initial87Sr/86Sr ratios (Isr = 0.7118 to 0.7140), which consistent with the isotopic characteristics of the Suozuodi granite. Pb and Sr isotopic results indicate that the ore-forming materials were derived from a crustal source, without addition of mantle materials. The Guanfang tungsten deposit was formed in a syn-collision tectonic setting during the late stage of the Yanshanian tectonism. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162502512095,,"Zhang, Yahui (1, 3); Zhang, Shitao (2); Tan, Shucheng (1); Cui, Yinliang (4); Zhao, Zhifang (1); Jiang, Yongguo (4); Jiang, Shunde (1); Tao, Shiyu (2) ","(1) Institute of Resource Environment and Earth Science, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Faculty of Land Resources Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, Nanjing University, Nanjing; 210093, China (4) Yunnan Nonferrous Metals Geological Bureau, Kunming; 650051, China ",,481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 549.2 Alkaline Earth Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals,,,,,Binary alloys - Deposits - Geochronology - Granite - Isotopes - Rhenium alloys - Silicate minerals - Sulfur compounds - Tungstate minerals - Tungsten deposits - Zircon,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Shitao(827379291@qq.com) ",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2016.05.025,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: USTB, Sponsor: University of Science and Technology Beijing; Number: -, Acronym: PKU, Sponsor: Peking University; Number: 41262004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41262004 ).

Nano,"This study investigates the optimal conditions for the synthesis of battery-grade ferrous oxalate as a raw material for preparing cathode material. Ferrous oxalate was prepared by liquid-phase precipitation method using ferrous sulfate and oxalic acid. Central composite design (CCD) was used to determine the effects of three preparation variables on purity and particle size: reaction temperature, aging time and concentration of ferrous sulfate. Based on CCD, the significant factors on each experimental design response identified the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The optimum ferrous oxalate preparation conditions were obtained reaction temperature of 31.32aC, aging time of 56.52min, and ferrous sulfate concentration of 5%. Under these optimum conditions, ferrous oxalate with purity of 99.69% and particle size of 4.92μm was obtained as best product which met and exceed the requirements of battery-grade ferrous oxalate. In addition, the special morphologies of ferrous oxalate prepared under different dispersant proportion was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to analyze the mechanism of synthesis. Morphology control study revealed that the dispersant could effectively change the surface energy between crystallographic planes, then result in anisotropic growth of the crystal structure and change the morphology of synthetic products. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,20163902851867,1650123,"Zhang, Keyu (1, 2); Yang, Xiaoyan (1, 2); Wu, Jian (1, 2); Huang, Xiaopeng (1, 2); Yao, Yaochun (1, 2) ","(1) National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yun-Nan Province Kunming; 650093, China (2) Engineering Laboratory for Advanced, Battery and Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yun-Nan Province Kunming; 650093, China ",,"802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 805 Chemical Engineering, General - 922 Statistical Methods - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Cathodes - Chemical industry - Crystal structure - Lithium-ion batteries - Morphology - Oxalic acid - Particle size - Precipitation (chemical) - Raw materials - Scanning electron microscopy - Sulfur compounds - Surface properties,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yao, Yaochun(yaochun9796@163.com) ",10.1142/S179329201650123X,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,17932920,11,"November 1, 2016",English,Analysis of variance (ANOVA),,40.0,,,2016,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Int. J. Heat Mass Transf.,"The flow within inclined differentially side heated square cavities is investigated with two-dimensional numerical simulations. The cavity is inclined such that the heated wall is below the cooled wall. The angle of inclination is varied from θ=0°, which produces the standard differentially heated cavity flow, up to 90° where Rayleigh Bernard flow exists. The variation in flow structure, flow stability and heat transfer is presented with angle of inclination and the Rayleigh number. Results have been obtained over Ra=104-108with Pr=7. It is shown that when the cavity is inclined the flow structure is changed with attached jet/plumes forming adjacent to the adiabatic walls, rather than diffuse intrusions as for the non-inclined side heated cavity. At a specific angle of inclination, the flow undergoes a bifurcation so that the fully developed flow is unsteady and single mode, with a further increase in inclination leading to multi-modal flow. The critical transition angle is shown to vary inversely with the Rayleigh number. A scaling relationship for the Nusselt number is proposed which approximates the effect of cavity inclination on total heat transfer. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Int. J. Bifurcation Chaos,"In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a five-dimensional virus model incorporating saturation incidence rate, CTL immune response and three time delays which represent the latent period, virus production period and immune response delay, respectively. We begin this model by proving the positivity and boundedness of the solutions. Our model admits three possible equilibrium solutions, namely the infection-free equilibrium E0, the infectious equilibrium without immune response E1 and the infectious equilibrium with immune response E2. Moreover, by analyzing corresponding characteristic equations, the local stability of each of the feasible equilibria and the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium point E2 are established, respectively. Further, by using fluctuation lemma and suitable Lyapunov functionals, it is shown that E0 is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproductive numbers for viral infection R0 is less than unity. When the basic reproductive numbers for immune response R1 is less than unity and R0 is greater than unity, the equilibrium point E1 is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out for illustrating the theoretical results. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,20170403268036,650234,"Guo, Ting (1); Liu, Haihong (1); Xu, Chenglin (1); Yan, Fang (1) ","(1) Department of Mathematical Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",,461.9 Biology - 461.9.1 Immunology - 921 Mathematics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity,,,,,Diseases - Dynamics - Hopf bifurcation - Viruses,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Haihong(lhhmath@aliyun.com) ",10.1142/S0218127416502345,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,02181274,14,"December 30, 2016",English,Immune system,,44.0,,,2016,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Spatial co-location patterns represent the subsets of spatial features whose instances are frequently located together in geographic space. Common frameworks for mining co-location patterns generate numerous redundant colocation patterns. Thus, several methods were proposed to overcome this drawback. However, most of these methods do not guarantee that the extracted colocation patterns are interesting for the user because they are generally based on statistical information. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker choose interesting co-location patterns with an efficient interactive procedure. This paper proposed an interactive approach to prune and filter discovered co-location patterns. First, ontologies were used to improve the integration of user knowledge. Second, an interactive process was designed to collaborate with the user to find the interesting co-location patterns efficiently. The experimental results on a real data set demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20164102893754,,"Bao, Xuguang (1); Wang, Lizhen (1); Chen, Hongmei (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 912.2 Management,,,,,Data mining - Decision making - Filtration - Ontology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Lizhen(lzhwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-45817-5_35,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by grants (No. 61472346, No. 61262069) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and in part by a grant (No. 2016FA026, No. 2015FB149, and No. 2015FB114) from the Science Foundation of Yunnan Province.",9783319458168.0,03029743,,2016,English,Location,"Web Technologies and Applications - 18th Asia-Pacific Web Conference, APWeb 2016, Proceedings",6.0,406-409,2 of 2,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Ontology-based interactive post-mining of interesting co-location patterns,,Co-location patterns - Interactive approach - Interactive feedback - Interactive process - Interesting patterns - Spatial co-location patterns - Spatial data mining - Statistical information,9932 LNCS

In this work, the adsorption behaviors and dissociation reaction path of water on the different surfaces of Au, Cu, and AuCu binary alloy were studied by using DFT calculations. Based on the calculations, the corresponding catalytic performance of each model was further analyzed. The calculated results showed that the catalytic activity of the considered four surface models is on the following order: Au(111) 1states of water or lb1-like states of H+OH groups also determines this interaction.

Int. J. Simul. Syst. Sci. Technol.,"Inventory here refers to the stock held by the retailer. There exists typical “anti-back benefits” phenomenon between stock held and transportation costs in online shopping supply chain, reduction of cost of stock storage lead to rising of transportation cost. Although there are many inventory and transportation studies, there is little literature integrating them together. The term ‘inventory-transportation integrated optimization’ (ITIO) combines the two aspects into one problem. We attempt to find an optimal solution to the joint problem rather than single problem for online shopping supply chain. This not only has theoretical value, but is also of practical significance. Under the condition that the retailer has decision-making powers on pricing, we solve the manufacturer and retailer’s optimal strategy in individual optimizations, and then solve the optimal ITIO strategy of online shopping supply chain. Finally, we compare the optimal strategies of ITIO and individual optimization, then analyze the efficiency and performance of different strategies. The study shows that: the total profits of the ITIO is greater than that of individual optimization, unit cost production, unit transportation costs and unit inventory cost have positive impact on ITIO retail price. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

Chem. Eng. Sci.,"Solubility and bioavailability of drug molecules are the key factors influencing their therapeutic effectiveness in-vivo. The desired drug concentration in systemic circulation can be achieved through the required dissolution of the drug in the biological environment which ultimately affects the pharmacological response. Efavirenz is an anti-HIV molecule with low solubility and variable bioavailability (IIIBstrain. The nanoparticle formulations were developed using solvent evaporation method and characterized for its size (110–283 nm), charge (−21 to −33 mV), % entrapment efficiency (57–95%), viscosity of nanosuspension (2.39–4.2 cP) and surface area of the particles (1.4 m2/g). The fourier transform infrared analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis of the pure drug and nanoparticles revealed the compatibility and stability of drug in nanoparticles. The in-vitro dissolution studies of the nanoparticles in distilled water media using type-1 USP dissolution apparatus at 100 rpm showed improved drug release based on the polymer composition, as compared with marketed formulations (capsules). The cytotoxicity and therapeutic activity of nanoparticles was studied by MTT assay in C8166 cell lines and syncytium formation assay using HIV-1IIIBstrain infected cell lines, respectively. Cell uptake of the nanoparticles was studied by confocal microscopy. The formulated nanoparticles were found to be safe and exhibiting 2-fold increase in therapeutic activity compared to pure drug, which could be attributed to improved dissolution and high cell uptake. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20163502752545,,"Vedha Hari, B.N.

Annu. Rep. Conf. Electr. Insul. Dielectr. Phenom. CEIDP,"Much work has been done to prevent copper corrosion in insulating oil with corrosive sulfur. Most of the research has focused on the addition of metal inhibitor and absorbent. Besides, changing the grain size and micro-structure of copper winding was an effective method to enhance the copper corrosion resistant. In this study, pure copper annealed at elevated temperature (400°C/20min) after cold rolled with varied deformation and corrosion experiments were investigated according to the IEC 62535 standard. Compared and analyzed the different shape variable after annealing copper strip corrosion condition and its influence on mineral oil insulation characteristics. And the evolution of grain sizes and special grain boundaries after the processing and annealing have been particularly determined by means of electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The results show that deformation controlling could increase the number of special grain boundary, and improve the grain size at the same time. Then, the corrosion resistance performance of copper enhanced dramatically. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170303264396,7785565,"Jiang, Zhou (1); Yuan, Yuan (1); Qingjun, Peng (2); Ruijin, Liao (3) ","(1) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China (2) Yunnan Electric Power Research, Institute China Southern Power Grid, Yunnan, Kunming, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Power, Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China ",CEIPAZ,413 Insulating Materials - 535.1.2 Rolling Mill Practice - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 539.1 Metals Corrosion - 539.2 Corrosion Protection - 544.1 Copper - 804 Chemical Products Generally,125477.0,"October 16, 2016 - October 19, 2016","Toronto, ON, Canada","2016 IEEE Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, CEIDP 2016",Annealing - Cold rolling - Copper - Corrosion prevention - Corrosion resistance - Deformation - Electric windings - Grain boundaries - Grain size and shape - Insulation - Metal cladding - Sulfur,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yuan, Yuan ",10.1109/CEIDP.2016.7785565,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 51677015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51407018, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51277187, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to thank the support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (51407018), (51677015) and (51277187).",9781509046546.0,00849162,,"December 15, 2016",English,Copper corrosion,"2016 IEEE Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, CEIDP 2016",13.0,893-896,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Annual Report - Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, CEIDP",,Improvement of copper sulfur corrosion resistant based on cold-rolled deformation,,Cold-rolled deformation - Corrosion-resistant - Corrosive sulfurs - Electron back scatter diffraction techniques - Elevated temperature - Evolution of grain - Metal inhibitors - Sulfur corrosions,2016-December
Mater. Res. Express,"By using organic vapor phase deposition method, nickel phthalocyanines (NiPc) nanowires were successfully prepared, and the effects of heating temperature on the structural and optical properties of NiPc nanowires were investigated. Both the crystal structures of NiPc powders and nanowires are studied by x-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR). The lattice constants of NiPc nanowires from the fitting ofXRDpatterns are a=13.04 Å, b=3.75 Å, c=24.32 Å, β=94.10°, belonging to the space group of monoclinic (P21/c). X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests main peaks at 284.82 eV and 286.18 eV for C-C and C-N bonds and two peaks at 397.8 eV and 398.8 eV for N-C and theN-Ni bonds, respectively, in NiPc nanowires. FTIR spectra show a structural transition from powder to nanowire. The optical properties of NiPc nanowires have been investigated via a comparison between theoretical and experimental approaches. The most significant absorption peaks of NiPc nanowires in the visible region are located at 626 nm and 672 nm, showing a blue shift comparing with the β-NiPc.Wehave also theoretically revealed the excitation energies in NiPc single molecule and dimer in the form of α and β phases using timedependent density-functional theory. These theoretical results are in qualitative agreement with the measurements of optical properties. Moreover, no noticeable change in crystalline form is shown when tuning the heating temperature from 420 °Cto 450 °C, suggesting a wide synthesis temperature window. The reduced Ni-Ni distance indicated a clear advantage over powder in terms of potential applications in organic electronics. ©2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,20191306679450,125002,"Wang, Xiaoyan (1); Wu, Wei (2); Ju, Haidong (3); Zou, Taoyu (1, 4); Qiao, Zhenfang (1, 4); Gong, Hao (5); Wang, Hai (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University, Kunming; 650214, China (2) Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London, Gower Street, London; WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom (3) Department of Chemical Science and Technology, Kunming University, Yunnan, Kunming; 65200, China (4) College of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (5) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore; 119260, Singapore ",,408 Structural Design - 548.1 Nickel - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 922.1 Probability Theory - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Binary alloys - Blue shift - Crystal structure - Density functional theory - Dimers - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Lattice constants - Nanowires - Nickel - Optical properties - Photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1088/2053-1591/3/12/125002,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20531591,,"This work is supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61166007, No. 11564023 No. 51562019), Applied Basic Research Programs of Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2010ZC164), and Candidates of the Young and Middle Aged Academic Leaders of Yunnan Province and program for IRTSTYN.",,,12,December 2016,English,Structural properties,,39.0,,,2016,Institute of Physics Publishing,Materials Research Express,,Experimental and theoretical studies of the structure and optical properties of nickel phthalocyanine nanowires,,Experimental approaches - Fourier transform infrared spectra - Nickel phthalocyanines - Organic vapor phase deposition - Structural and optical properties - Synthesis temperatures - TDDFT - Time dependent density functional theory,3
Taiyangneng Xuebao,"A new method to measure trap characteristics in crystalline silicon solar cells is presented. Important parameters of traps including energy level, total concentration of trapping centers and capture cross-section ratio of hole to electron are deduced using the Shockley-Read-Hall theory of crystalline silicon solar cells in base region. Based on the as-deduced model, these important parameters of traps are determined by measuring open-circuit voltages of silicon solar cells under monochromatic illumination in the wavelength range 500-1050 nm with and without bias light. The effects of wavelength and intensity of bias light on the measurement results are also discussed. The measurement system used in our experiments is very similar to a quantum efficiency test system which is commercially available.

To take both two aspects into account, this paper proposed a model and the corresponding method of risk assessment of dynamic stability for large-scale interconnected grid. Further it shows a new criterion of dynamic stability combined with the actual power grid operation data, finally, the author take Yunnan power grid as the objective for the research and application. Through the cases of different sending outputs schemes, it proposes that the risk of dynamic instability can be reduced by coordinating the sending outputs among ends of the interconnected power grid, and it gives the method that how to determine the maximum external feeding power and corresponding operating mode of Yunnan power grid according to the new criterion. Meanwhile, it proves that the dynamic instability risk can be reduced by rational configuring of power system stabilizer and correct scheme of DC modulation, and the both two methods can be used as risk value reduction measures to respond to system dynamic instability fault. © 2016, The editorial office of Transaction of China Electrotechnical Society.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Aims. We aim to obtain time-series photometry of the very crowded central regions of Galactic globular clusters; to obtain better angular resolution thanhas been previously achieved with conventional CCDs on ground-based telescopes; and to complete, or improve, the census of the variable star population in those stellar systems. Methods. Images were taken using the Danish 1.54-m Telescope at the ESO observatory at La Silla in Chile. The telescope was equipped with an electron-multiplying CCD, and the short-exposure-time images obtained (ten images per second) were stacked using the shift-and-add technique to produce the normal-exposure-time images (minutes). Photometry was performed via difference image analysis. Automatic detection of variable stars in the field was attempted. Results. The light curves of 12 541 stars in the cores of ten globular clusters were statistically analysed to automatically extract the variable stars. We obtained light curves for 31 previously known variable stars (3 long-period irregular, 2 semi-regular, 20 RR Lyrae, 1 SX Phoenicis, 3 cataclysmic variables, 1 W Ursae Majoris-type and 1 unclassified) and we discovered 30 new variables (16 long-period irregular, 7 semi-regular, 4 RR Lyrae, 1 SX Phoenicis and 2 unclassified). Fluxes and photometric measurements for these stars are available in electronic form through the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. © ESO, 2016.",Open Access,20161702293557,A128,"Figuera Jaimes, R.

Zongguo Gonglu Xuebao,"In order to provide a feasible reliability analysis method for the stability analysis of high slope under the seismic force in southwest Yunnan, aimed at the main variables affecting the reliability calculation of slope under seismic force, the randomness and uncertainty of the seismic force, and the uncertainty of shear strength parameters of rock and soil mass were mainly considered. And to fully consider the actual distribution laws of variables and the relationships among variables, the transfer coefficient method was used to establish the limit state equation of slope by introducing the action of seismic force, and then the limit state equation was solved by the checking point method, and the non-normal variables were dealt with the equivalent normal treatment. By solving and analyzing the limit state equation, the effect of seismic force on the reliability index of the slope, the relationship between the high slope stability reliability index and seismic force, the relationship between the failure probability and the seismic force, and the distribution law of the main influence factors of the slope reliability under the action of seismic load were obtained. The results show that the impact of seismic force on the reliability index of the slope is very huge, and reliability index under the action of seismic force decreases by 50%-97% compared with that without the action of seismic force; the reliability index of the slope decreases with the increase of the seismic force, and the failure probability increases with the increase of the seismic force; peak value of horizontal earthquake acceleration approximates to the extreme I type distribution under different earthquake intensities, and the shear strength parameters are both approximation to the normal distribution, and have certain correlations. © 2016, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Nanoscale Res. Lett.,"Diamond thin films are grown on silicon substrates by only using methanol and argon mixtures in microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) reactor. It is worth mentioning that the novel strategy makes the synthesis reaction works smoothly without hydrogen atmosphere, and the substrates temperature is only 500 °C. The evidence of surface morphology and thickness under different time is obtained by characterizing the samples using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffractometer (XRD) spectrum reveals that the preferential orientation of (111) plane sample is obtained. The Raman spectra indicate that the dominant component of all the samples is a diamond. Moreover, the diamond phase content of the targeted films was quantitatively analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) method, and the surface roughness of diamond films was investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM). Meanwhile, the possible synthesis mechanism of the diamond films in methanol- and argon-mixed atmosphere was discussed. © 2016, The Author(s).",Open Access,20163902841359,415,"Yang, Li (1, 2, 3, 5); Jiang, Caiyi (1, 3, 5); Guo, Shenghui (1, 2, 3, 5); Zhang, Libo (1, 2, 3, 5); Gao, Jiyun (4); Peng, Jinhui (1, 2, 3, 5); Hu, Tu (1, 3, 5); Wang, Liang (1, 2, 5) ","(1) State International Joint Research Center of Advanced Technology for Superhard Materials, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) National Local Joint Laboratory of Engineering Application of Microwave Energy and Equipment Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (4) School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China (5) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",,"711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 813.1 Coating Techniques - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Argon - Atomic force microscopy - Hydrogen - Methanol - Microwaves - Plasma CVD - Scanning electron microscopy - Substrates - Surface roughness - Synthetic diamonds - Thin films - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Libo(zhanglibopaper@126.com) ",10.1186/s11671-016-1628-x,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1556276X,,,,19317573,1,"December 1, 2016",English,Diamond films,,33.0,,,2016,Springer New York LLC,Nanoscale Research Letters,,Novel Diamond Films Synthesis Strategy: Methanol and Argon Atmosphere by Microwave Plasma CVD Method Without Hydrogen,,Hydrogen atmosphere - Microwave plasma chemical vapor depositions - Microwave plasma CVD - Preferential orientation - Substrates temperature - Synthesis mechanism - Synthesis strategy - X ray diffractometers,11
Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"For the difficulty of marking Vietnamese dependency tree, this paper proposed the method which combined MST algorithm and improved Nivre algorithm to build Vietnamese dependency treebank. The method took full advantage of the characteristics of collaborative training. Firstly, we built a bit samples. Secondly, we used the samples to build two weak learners with two fully redundant views. Then, we marked a large number of unmarked samples mutually. Next, we selected the samples of high trust to relearn and built a dependency parsing system. Finally, we used 5000 Vietnamese sentences marked manually to do tenfold cross-test and obtained the accuracy of 76.33 %. Experimental results showed that the proposed method in this paper could take full advantage of unmarked corpus to effectively improve the quality of dependency treebank. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,20164402968138,,"Qiu, Guoke (1); Guo, Jianyi (1); Yu, Zhengtao (2); Xian, Yantuan (2); Mao, Cunli (2) ","(1) The School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) The Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",185279.0,"October 15, 2016 - October 16, 2016","Yantai, China","15th China National Conference on Chinese Computational Linguistics, CCL 2016 and 4th International Symposium on Natural Language Processing Based on Naturally Annotated Big Data, NLP-NABD 2016",Computational linguistics - Forestry - Learning algorithms - Natural language processing systems - Syntactics - Trees (mathematics),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Guo, Jianyi(gjade86@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-47674-2_8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 2013FA030, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61262041, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61363044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472168, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61262041, 61363044 and 61472168) and the key project of National Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan province (Grant No. 2013FA030).",9783319476735.0,03029743,,2016,English,Big data,"Chinese Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing Based on Naturally Annotated Big Data - 15th China National Conference, CCL 2016 and 4th International Symposium, NLP-NABD 2016, Proceedings",15.0,86-100,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Baidu; GRIDSUM; Iflytek; shujutang,Using collaborative training method to build Vietnamese dependency treebank,,Collaborative training - Dependency parsing - Dependency trees - Treebanks - Vietnamese - Weak learner,10035 LNAI
Appl. Energy,"The size and geometry of oxygen carriers are one of the key factors to determine the efficiency of a large-scale chemical looping combustion (CLC) system in fixed bed reactors, because they strongly affect the dynamic conditions of the gas-solid reactions, such as the intra particle mass transfer limitation for reactants, the pressure drop and the flow distribution. In the present work, we describe for the first time the utilization of bulk monolithic oxygen carriers for chemical looping combustion of methane in a fixed bed reactor. The comparison on the structure and reactivity of the monolithic Ce-Zr-Fe-O/Al2O3oxygen carrier with the powder one is investigated in detail. The successive CH4-reduction/air-oxidation redox testing of the monolithic oxygen carrier is also performed. It is found that the Ce-Zr-Fe-O/Al2O3oxygen carriers own high activity for methane complete oxidation due to the strong active component (i.e., Ce-Zr-Fe-O) to support (i.e., Al2O3) interaction. The powder and monolithic oxygen carriers show similar reduction behaviors either in hydrogen or in methane atmosphere. This indicates that the utilization of organic binders and additives in the fabrication procedures of the monolith has no significant effect on the reducibility of the oxygen carrier. The monolithic oxygen carriers used in the chemical looping combustion of methane in its natural form (4.5cm long, 6.0cm in diameter, square cell size of 2.0mm, and wall thickness of 0.9mm) represent high activity in a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV, 6000h-1). This can be attributed to the special geometric structure and layered microstructure. The activity of the monolithic oxygen carrier is also very stable in the successive redox process. On the other hand, the requirement on the mechanical strength of the monolithic oxygen carrier is much lower than that toward the pellets, which allows the oxygen carrier to have relatively high specific surface area in a large-scale CLC system. The monolith reveals very high structure stability in both macro and micro aspect during the chemical looping process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,20154601557737,,"Gu, Zhenhua (1, 2); Li, Kongzhai (1, 2); Wang, Hua (1, 2); Qing, Shan (1, 2); Zhu, Xing (1, 2); Wei, Yonggang (1, 2); Cheng, Xianming (1); Yu, He (1); Cao, Yan (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Department of Chemistry, Institute for Combustion Science and Environmental Technology, Western Kentucky University, 2413 Nashville Road, Bowling Green; KY; 42101, United States ",APENDX,641.3 Mass Transfer - 801 Chemistry - 802.1 Chemical Plants and Equipment - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Cerium compounds - Chemical reactors - Chemical stability - Combustion - Iron compounds - Mass transfer - Methane - Zirconium compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Kongzhai(kongzhai.li@aliyun.com) ",10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.177,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2012HB009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014HB006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FB123, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2012FD016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51174105, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51374004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51204083, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51306084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work has been financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 51374004 , 51204083 , 51174105 and 51306084 ), the Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province (Project Nos. 2014HB006 and 2012HB009 ) and the Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province (Project Nos. 2014FB123 and 2012FD016 ).",,03062619,,"February 01, 2016",English,Oxygen,,71.0,19-31,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Applied Energy,,Bulk monolithic Ce-Zr-Fe-O/Al2O3oxygen carriers for a fixed bed scheme of the chemical looping combustion: Reactivity of oxygen carrier,,Chemical looping combustion - Chemical-looping process - Fixed bed reactor - Gas hourly space velocities - High specific surface area - Layered microstructure - Oxygen Carrier - Redox stability,163

Inf. Syst. Front.,"A new approach for face recognition, based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and support vector machines (SVMs), is presented to improve the recognition performance of the method based on principal component analysis (PCA). This method can simultaneously be applied to solve both the over-fitting problem and the small sample problem. The KPCA method is performed on every facial image of the training set to get the core facial features of the training samples. To ensure that the loss of the image information will be as less as possible, the facial data of high-dimensional feature space is projected into low-dimensional space, and then the SVM face recognition model is established to identify the low-dimensional space facial data.

Wood Sci Technol,"In this study, microwave plasma was used to treat the surface of Pinus yunnanensis wood under the conditions of 220 V of input voltage, 20 μA of filament current, 8.8 mW of output power, 11 mW of reflected power, 2450 MHz of frequency, and 700 Pa of vacuum. The microwave plasma presented very significant treatment effects on the treated surface, even under weak treatment conditions, for example long treatment distance of 120 mm and short treatment time of 60 s. The treated surface showed better surface wettability, and the contact angles on the treated surface measured from deionized water, glycerin, and diiodomethane decreased sharply, even decreased to 0°. The treated surface also presented higher surface free energy, for example, 61.4–62.8 mJ m−2, being greatly improved by microwave plasma compared to that of untreated surface of 46.5 mJ m−2. The bond strength of the treated surface was 7.34 MPa, about 16 % higher than 6.31 MPa for untreated surface. The best treatment effect was obtained for the treatment distance of 120 mm and treatment time of 60–300 s.

High Temp Mater Processes,"The effects of sodium citrate on ammonium sulfate recycled leaching of low-grade zinc oxide ores were studied. By applying various kinds of detection and analysis techniques such as chemical composition analysis, chemical phase method, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrum (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transforming infrared spectrum (FT-IR), zinc raw ore, its leaching slag and the functional mechanism of sodium citrate were investigated. Based on a comprehensive analysis, it can be concluded that in contrast to hemimorphite (Zn4Si2O7(OH)2· H2O), amorphous smithsonite (ZnCO3) and zinc silicate (Zn2SiO4) prove to be refractory phases under ammonium sulfate leaching, while sodium citrate has a better chelating action with the refractory phases, resulting in a higher zinc leaching rate. Under conditions of [NH3]/[NH3]Tmolar ratio being 0.5, [NH3]Tbeing 7.5 mol/L, [Na3C6H5O7] being 0.2 mol/L, S/L ratio being 1:5, temperature being 303 K, holding time being 1 h in each of the two stages, and stirring rate being 300 rpm, the leaching rate of zinc reached 93.4%. In this article, sulfate ammonium recycled technology also reveals its unique advantage in processing low-grade zinc oxide ores accompanied by high silicon and high alkaline gangue. © 2016 by De Gruyter.",,20161202116835,,"Yang, Kun (1, 2, 3, 4); Li, Shi-Wei (1, 2, 3, 4); Zhang, Li-Bo (1, 2, 3, 4); Peng, Jin-Hui (1, 2, 3, 4); Ma, Ai-Yuan (1, 2, 3, 4); Wang, Bao-Bao (1, 2, 3, 4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Natl.

Xiyou Jinshu,"Molten salt electrolysis is an effective method to prepare refractory metals and their alloys. Fe-Ti oxide electrode containing iron particles was prepared with compression molding of mixture consisting of ilmenite concentration and carbon powder, by carbon thermal reduction in argon atmosphere at 1173, 1273 and 1373 K, respectively, then it was electrochemically reduced to Ti Fe alloy in LiCl-KCl molten salt at 673 K. When the temperatures of carbon thermal reduction were 1173, 1273 and 1373 K, the reduction rates of iron in the electrode were 30.1%, 80.1% and 82.7%, respectively. The conductivities of the electrode were 3.14, 8.06 and 10.87 S·m-1, respectively, and the open porosities were 46.1%, 50.9% and 35.2%, respectively. The reduced iron in the Fe-Ti oxide electrode prepared at 1173 K uniformly distributed and was of small spherical particle, but the reduction rate of iron was low and the electrode strength was inadequate. In the electrode prepared at 1373 K, enrichment, marked segregation, and converging into strips seemed to occur to the reduced iron. This made the open porosity of the electrode decrease significantly, and the electrode like this was not beneficial for molten salt electrolyte diffusing and infiltrating inside the electrode. The iron in the electrode prepared at 1273 K was spherical and had particles size of 2~6 μm, and the phenomenon of uniform distribution and high open porosity could be observed. Ti-Fe alloy could be obtained by the electrolytic reduction in low temperature molten salt of KCl-LiCl at 673 K, besides the current was the maximum. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

"Conf. Proc. Int. Symp. Proj. Manag., ISPM","Soft soil is a kind of special soil, which is difficult to achieve the bearing capacity of the foundations. Shear strength of the soil including two factors, cohesion and the internal frictional angle, which could reflect the strength of the soil, is important for the engineering design. The soft soil in the south of Kunming Basin, Yunnan Province is different with the soft soil in the coastal areas because of its complex causes and special geotechnical properties. However, soft soil in Kunming Basin is still classified and evaluated by the national standards that is mainly formation by the statistics of the coastal areas, which would cause great risks in the construction of Kunming city. In order to get some correlativity between the shear strength and physical parameters of soft soil, this paper takes twentyseven areas in the south of Kunming Basin which are constituted by soft soil into study. The result presents that neither the linear relation nor the multivariate linear relation between cohesion and the physical parameters, the correlativity is too low to put forward a empirical formula, which indicate the cohesion might be closely related to the organic content.

However, wild resources are so limited that it can not meet the needs of the market. The development of wild and cultivated samples and research on accumulation dynamics of chemical component are of great significance. In order to compare composition difference of different parts (root, stem, and leaf) of wild and cultivated G. rigescens, Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and second derivative spectra were used to analyze and evaluate. The second derivative spectra of 60 samples and the rate of affinity (the match values) were measured automatically using the appropriate software (Omnic 8.0). The results showed that the various parts of wild and cultivated G. rigescens. were high similar the peaks at 1 732, 1 643, 1 613, 1 510, 1 417, 1 366, 1 322, 1 070 cm-1were the characteristic peak of esters, terpenoids and saccharides, respectively. Moreover, the shape and peak intensity were more distinct in the second derivative spectrum of samples. In the second derivative spectrum range of 1 800~600 cm-1, the fingerprint characteristic peak of samples and gentiopicroside standards were 1 679, 1 613, 1 466, 1 272, 1 204, 1 103, 1 074, 985, 935 cm-1. The characteristic peak intensity of gentiopicroside of roots of wild and cultivated samples at 1 613 cm-1(C-C) was higher than stems and leaves which indicated the higher content of gentiopicroside in root than in stem and leaves. Stems of wild samples at 1 521, 1 462 and 1 452 cm-1are the skeletal vibration peak of benzene ring of lignin, and the stem of cultivated sample have stronger peak than other samples which showed that rich lignin in stems. The iInfrared spectrum of samples were similar with the average spectral of root of wild samples, and significant difference was found for the correlation between second derivative spectrum of samples and average spectral of wild samples root, and the sequence of similarity was root>stem>leaf. Therefore, FTIR combined with second derivative spectra was an express and comprehensive approach to analyze and evaluate in the imperceptible differences among different parts of wild and cultivated of G. rigescens. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"Yunnan Ham is one of China's 3 best-known brands of dry-cured hams. Over many years, the production of Yunnan Ham has relied on the manual skills of workers. Therefore, the production process is confronted with such problems as inefficiency, extremely high salinity, and instability in quality. Because of the impact of other domestic and foreign ham brands, the market share of Yunnan Ham has been declining every year. Considering this situation, the Yunnan Agricultural University has developed a novel HTRZJ500 ham-kneading machine (hereinafter referred to as HTRZJ500) suited for the production features of Yunnan Ham. The HTRZJ500 operates based on the following principles: while dry-cured pig legs are conveyed on a belt, it is kneaded by a cam gear and pressure-rolling device located below and above the conveyor belt, respectively; the pig leg is kneaded and massaged through a combination of top kneading and roll kneading. Based on the anatomical structure of a Yunnan Ham and the structural dimensions of the kneading device, the pig leg model is divided into 4 kneading sections (i.e., A, B, C and D), and a working position graph for the 7 typical kneading positions used during the process is drawn, from feeding the pig leg onto the kneading area to the complete exiting of the pig leg through the second group of pressure rollers in the kneading area. As shown in the working position graph, there is a phase angle difference of 90° between the adjacent cams. The pig leg is jointly kneaded by 2 groups of cams and 2 groups of pressure rollers throughout the process, from the entry of Section A to the exit of Section D through the second group of cams. The pig leg experiences a wavelike kneading effect under the joint action of top kneading by cams and roll kneading by pressure rollers. Based on the working position graph and design parameters, the pig leg is top-kneaded approximately 36 times by the cams for 12 s. The 2 peak values of kneading force are 609 and 973 N. The Yunnan Agricultural University developed a SolidWorks-based virtual prototype of the ham-kneading device, and employed SolidWorks Motion to simulate the kneading process during which the pig leg passed through 3 groups of pressure rollers. The simulation time was 4 s, and the velocity diagram and acceleration diagram for the pig leg was obtained with the simulated variation curve for the kneading force. The following simulation results were obtained: (1) Both the velocity and acceleration of the pig leg changed in the vertical direction; the acceleration changed uniformly. The continuous up-down vibration of the pig leg helped in fully eliminating the accumulated blood in internal blood vessels, loosed the leg meat and caused rapid penetration and diffusion of salt into the leg meat. (2) The simulated variation curve of kneading force had 2 peak values (677 and 994 N), and the relative errors between simulation and calculated value of the working position graph were 10% and 2.1% respectively, proving the practicality of the kinematics simulation analysis model. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the kneading process of the kneading machine developed for Yunnan Ham through a combination of diagrammatic method and virtual simulation technology. The research methods and ideas are very novel, and the research contents are significant for improving the mechanized production process of Yunnan Ham. The research conclusions provide theoretical and technical guidance for pilot production and structure optimization of the physical prototype of HTRZJ500 in the future study. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Due-window assignment with common flow allowances means that each job has a job-dependent due window, the start time and finish time of which are equal to its actual processing time plus individual job-independent parameters shared by all the jobs, respectively. The processing time of each job can be controlled by extra resource allocation as a linear function of the amount of a common continuously divisible resource allocated to the job. Two criteria are considered, where one criterion is an integrated cost consisting of job earliness, weighted number of tardy jobs, and due-window assignment cost, while the other criterion is the resource consumption cost. Four different models are considered for treating the two criteria. It is shown that the problem under the model where the two criteria are integrated into a single criterion is polynomially solvable, while the problems under the other three models are all NP-hard and an optimal solution procedure is developed for them. Two polynomially solvable cases are also identified and investigated. Finally, numerical studies with randomly generated instances are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Shuikexue Jinzhan,"Composite roughness is a crucial parameter in determining the stage-discharge relationship using Manning's formula. Due to the increased resistance resulting from ice cover, a stage-discharge relationship developed in open water is not applicable to the ice-affected reason. This calls for the development of a new stage-discharge relationship. According to the Einstein hydraulic radius separation theory, the flow cross section of a rectangular ice-covered river may be divided into bed, ice and side-wall subsections. Based on the determination of hydraulic radius and sectional area of each flow subsection, this paper presents an analytical solution of composite roughness for flows in rectangular ice-covered rivers. Comparisons of the calculated results with measured data from literature show that the proposed formula does well in predicting the composite roughness of rectangular ice-covered rivers. Compared with Einstein formula and Sabaneev formula, the proposed formula produces more accurate results. For wide ice-covered rivers, if width-depth ratio is greater than 20, hydraulic radius may be considered approximately equivalent to flow depth as a simplification of relatively high precision. © 2016, Science Press.

Appl. Catal. B Environ.,"Overall water splitting is a huge challenge for the semiconductor photocatalysts. Herein, we investigated the high effective photocatalytic overall water stoichiometrically splitting into H2and O2activity using the SnOx-NiGa2O4(SNG) composites photocatalysts. Because of the effective charge separation and transfer in SnOx-NiGa2O4composites, the photocatalytic activity of the optimized composites photocatalysts can reach up to more than one order of magnitude greater than that of NiGa2O4(NGO) or SnOxalone respectively. In addition, under visible light irradiation the photocatalysts also displayed well both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and pollution degradation potentials. More importantly, we further elucidated the essential band gap relation between the SnOxand NiGa2O4in the heterostructure, and a deep understanding of the charge separation mechanism based on the band alignment in such system was provided. Our study demonstrates great potential of the SnOx-NiGa2O4composites to be an attractive photocatalysts for the overall water splitting or pollution degradation under visible light irradiation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20154001328022,,"Lv, Xiao-Jun (1); Zhou, Shixiong (2); Huang, Xing (1); Wang, Chuanjun (1); Fu, Wen-Fu (1, 2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Photochemical Conversion and Optoelectronic Materials, HKU-CAS Joint Laboratory on New Materials, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100190, China (2) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",ACBEE3,453 Water Pollution - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals,,,,,Energy gap - Irradiation - Light - Nickel compounds - Photocatalysts - Photodegradation - Separation - Surface treatment - Tin compounds - Water pollution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lv, Xiao-Jun(xjlv@mail.ipc.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.09.032,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: TEM, Sponsor: Ty&ouml;- ja Elinkeinoministeri&ouml;; Number: 2132057, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; Number: 2013CB834804, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012DFH40090, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology; Number: 21107117, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21353002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21477136, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2013CB834804) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (2012DFH40090).

Mater Manuf Process,"This article describes a new process to manufacture open-cell steel foams. Calcium chloride anhydrous is used as a space holder. By changing the values of the main manufacturing parameters such as volume percentage, and the size and shape of the space holder, we produce different steel foam samples which cover a wide range of solid fraction, pore size, and shape. The effects of space-holder content and sintering condition such as temperature and time on the porosity of steel foam samples are discussed. The microstructure and composition of steel foam samples are observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction. The compressive curves of steel foams are measured by a universal testing machine. The experiment results show the compressive strength of steel foam samples with porosities between 65% and 85% is in the range of 66.4 ∼ 12.9 MPa. The compressive strength depends mainly on the porosity and pore shape. The absorbed energy per unit volume (W) of steel foams with porosities between 85% and 65% is in range of 6.8 ∼ 31.2 MJ/m3. Under the condition of identical porosity, the absorbed energy per unit volume (W) of steel foam is about three times of aluminum foam. In compression, steel foam specimens show heterogeneous macroscopic deformation. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,20161802334948,,"Guo, Kunshan (1); Li, Mingchao (1); Gong, Quan (1); Li, Congshan (1); Li, Chunhui (1); Zhong, Hao (1); Zhou, Yun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",MMAPET,"537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 545.3 Steel - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Calcium chloride - Compaction - Compressive strength - Energy absorption - Manufacture - Pore size - Porosity - Scanning electron microscopy - Sintering - Testing - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Yun(zyuncrystal@yahoo.com) ",10.1080/10426914.2015.1103852,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15322475,,,,10426914,12,"September 9, 2016",English,Steel testing,,22.0,1597-1602,,2016,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Materials and Manufacturing Processes,,Experimental Investigation on Steel Foams Fabricated by Sintering-Dissolution Process,,CaCl2 - Plateau stress - Space holders - Stainless - Steel foams,31

Ceram Int,"The LiFePO4/C (LFP/C) composite as a cathode material for lithium-ion battery was synthesized by solid-state reaction under vacuum sintering condition (20–5 Pa). The effects of vacuum sintering temperature and time on the phase composition, morphological structure, and electrochemical performance of LFP/C composite were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The synthetic LFP/C composite possessed uniform particle-size distribution with porous architecture upon sintering at 650 °C for 12 h and thus exhibited the highest discharge capacity and best cycle performance. The complete decomposition of citric acid at a suitable temperature under vacuum condition resulted in the formation of porous structure. Compared with atmospheric argon sintering, vacuum sintering method led to the formation of porous architecture, the porous sample showed excellent cycle performance with less than 2% capacity loss after 80 cycles at 0.2 C, and reached the discharge specific capacity of 87.6 mAh g−1at 10 C rate, these are better than that of atmospheric argon sintering.

Cluster Comput.,"Drought is a stochastic natural hazard that is caused by intense and persistent shortage of precipitation. Spatial and temporal patterns of drought have been analyzed by several methods, ranging from satellite images to historical records; however, drought is generally identified by climate elements. Drought indices are quantitative measures that characterize drought levels by assimilating data from one or several variables (indicators). A number of different indices have been developed to quantify droughts, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, using the remote sensing image to acquire the vegetation cover data, and combined with meteorological data and the Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to discuss the spatial and temporal characteristics of the drought. Based on precipitation observations Pu’er City, Yunnan Province, ten counties (districts) ten meteorological observation stations from 1961 to 2010 monthly for 50 years, mainly in ArcGIS10.1 analysis platform, using Mann–Kendall nonparametric trend test method for time-series trends in precipitation was tested, using ArcGIS in inverse distance weighting interpolation tool were precipitation the amount and distribution of precipitation anomaly percentage.

Phys B Condens Matter,"We carry out theoretical studies for both the pristine and boron-nitrogen co-doped (4,3) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We first acquire the optimized geometries using a pure functional. We then obtain the electronic structures with a relatively accurate hybrid functional. We systematically study four different patterns for doping along different chain directions. Our calculated results reveal that the energy band splits, and many new states appear in the gap after doping. The band gap gradually decreases with the increasing number of dopants, while it begins to expand when the doping concentration is larger. Through projected density of states analyses, we find that the individual atoms make different contribution to the valence states, gap region states, and conduction states. These findings are expected to provide some reliable theoretical supports with the following research on the modification of carbon nanotubes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Dianwang Jishu,"PSD-BPA program is widely used in dispatching departments in China. Currently, interaction of its operation modes between regional, provincial and district power grids is in text form. This brings some disadvantages, such as difficulty in process control, tediousness in data merge, incapability in realizing two-way linkage between data and graphics and so on. For these reasons, this paper proposed a visualization interaction strategy of operation modes. Based on a visual geographical wiring diagram platform integrating many simulation functions, a two-way relationship between equipment parameters and graphic elements was built. Operation modes thus could be scheduled on this platform completely. Meanwhile, two ways developed for regional and provincial coordination were keeping provincial data and comparing network topology. Coordination between provincial and district power grids was based on differential storage. Furthermore, under closed-loop process control, integrated interaction was achieved. Successful application for operation mode (such as monthly, yearly, three-year operation modes and so on) scheduling in Yunnan Power Grid shows that the proposed strategy and platform are practical in application and can remarkably improve efficiency. © 2016, Power System Technology Press.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Context. Since NGC 300 is a bulgeless, isolated low-mass galaxy and it has not experienced radial migration during its evolution history, it can be treated as an ideal laboratory to test the simple galactic chemical evolution model. Aims. Our main aim is to investigate the main properties of the star formation history (SFH) of NGC 300 and compare its SFH with that of M 33 to explore the common properties and differences between these two nearby low-mass systems. Methods. We construct a simple chemical evolution model for NGC 300, assuming its disk forms gradually from continuous accretion of primordial gas and including the gas-outflow process. The model allows us to build a bridge between the SFH and observed data of NGC 300, in particular, the present-day radial profiles and global observed properties (e.g., cold gas mass, star formation rate, and metallicity). By means of comparing the model predictions with the corresponding observations, we adopt the classical χ2methodology to find out the best combination of free parameters a, b, and bout. Results. Our results show that by assuming an inside-out formation scenario and an appropriate outflow rate, our model reproduces well most of the present-day observational values. The model not only reproduces well the radial profiles, but also the global observational data for the NGC 300 disk. Our results suggest that NGC 300 may experience a rapid growth of its disk. Through comparing the best-fitting, model-predicted SFH of NGC 300 with that of M 33, we find that the mean stellar age of NGC 300 is older than that of M 33 and there is a recent lack of primordial gas infall onto the disk of NGC 300. Our results also imply that the local environment may play a key role in the secular evolution of galaxy disks. © ESO, 2015.",Open Access,20155101679626,A20,"Kang, Xiaoyu (1, 2, 3); Zhang, Fenghui (1, 2); Chang, Ruixiang (4); Wang, Lang (1, 2, 3); Cheng, Liantao (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China (2) Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (4) Key Laboratory for Research in Galaxies and Cosmology, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 80 Nandan Road, Shanghai; 200030, China ",AAEJAF,657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena,,,,,Stars,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1051/0004-6361/201527041,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320746,,,,00046361,,"January 1, 2016",English,Galaxies,,93.0,,,2016,EDP Sciences,Astronomy and Astrophysics,,The star formation history of low-mass disk galaxies: A case study of NGC 300,,Chemical evolution - Galactic chemical evolutions - Galaxies: abundances - Galaxies: evolutions - Galaxies: individual: NGC 300 - Galaxies: spirals - Local environments - Star formation rates,585

Energies,"Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) partial discharge (PD) online monitoring is an effective way to inspect potential faults and insulation defects in power transformers. The construction of UHF PD online monitoring system is a challenge because of the high-frequency and wide-frequency band of the UHF PD signal. This paper presents a novel, intelligent sensor for UHF PD online monitoring based on a new method, namely a level scanning method. The intelligent sensor can directly acquire the statistical characteristic quantities and is characterized by low cost, few data to output and transmit, Ethernet functionality, and small size for easy installation. The prototype of an intelligent sensor was made. Actual UHF PD experiments with three typical artificial defect models of power transformers were carried out in a laboratory, and the waveform recording method and intelligent sensor proposed were simultaneously used for UHF PD measurement for comparison. The results show that the proposed intelligent sensor is qualified for the UHF PD online monitoring of power transformers. Additionally, three methods to improve the performance of intelligent sensors were proposed according to the principle of the level scanning method. © 2016 by the authors.",,20192006934862,383,"Li, Jian (1); Li, Xudong (1); Du, Lin (1); Cao, Min (2); Qian, Guochao (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China (2) Yunnan Electric Power Research Institute, Kunming; 650217, China ",,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 721.2 Logic Elements - 723.4.1 Expert Systems - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Defects - Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) - High frequency transformers - Intelligent control - Monitoring - Power transformers - Scanning - Smart sensors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Du, Lin(dulin@cqu.edu.cn) ",10.3390/en9050383,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19961073,"Number: 2011AA05A120, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Scientific Research and Technology Development Program of Guangxi; Number: 51321063, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: B08036, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; ","The authors acknowledge the National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (2011AA05A120).

In this paper, we adopt a latent variable to describe user preference and Bayesian network (BN) with a latent variable as the framework for representing the relationships among the observed and the latent variables, and define user preference BN (abbreviated as UPBN). To construct UPBN effectively, we first give the property and initial structure constraint that enable conditional probability distributions (CPDs) related to the latent variable to fit the given data set by the Expectation- Maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, we give the EM-based algorithm for constraint-based maximum likelihood estimation of parameters to learn UPBN’s CPDs from the incomplete data w.r.t. the latent variable. Following, we give the algorithm to learn the UPBN’s graphical structure by applying the structural EM (SEM) algorithm and the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC).

Firstly, Vietnamese grammatical feature set is established by analysis of Vietnamese grammatical features. Then, grammar rule set of PCFG model is obtained from manual annotation Vietnamese phrase trees. Finally, Vietnamese grammatical feature set is fused into improved PCFG model, which is regarded as a supplement, and the method completes the construction of Vietnamese phrase Treebank. The experimental results show that the accuracy of proposed PCFG model for the Vietnamese phrase Treebank construction reaches 89.12%.

Metall Mat Trans B Process Metall Mat Process Sci,"In this study, we investigated the thermodynamics and kinetics of boron removal from metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) using a calcium silicate slag containing a high basic potassium carbonate. The distribution of boron between slag and silicon was theoretically derived and the distribution coefficients (LB) of boron with different compositions of CaO, SiO2, and K2CO3in slag reagents were determined. The maximal value of LBreached 2.08 with a high basicity slag of 40 pctCaO-40 pctSiO2-20 pctK2CO3(Λ = 0.73).

Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"An adaptive wide area fault location algorithm for transmission lines with optimal phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement was proposed to solve the transmission line fault location problem under the conditions of lacking complete information. On the basis of analyzing fault-location observability based fault location principle, optimal PMU placement model for transmission network fault-location observability considering zero injection bus was established. Then the wide area fault location algorithm based on fault-location zone which was divided according to the grid topology and PMU installed nodes was proposed. When the grid topology changes, the fault-location zone was also updated correspondingly with partial modification. After the line failure, the fault-location zone that the fault line belongs to was quickly determined using PMU measurement. Without fault line information requirement, the adaptability of the proposed fault location method was improved. Simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC and Matlab have shown that the proposed method requires fewer PMU devices to achieve transmission network fault-location observability. The fault location algorithm based on fault-location zone has strong adaptability and high accuracy and is suitable to grid topology changes as well as various fault types, fault positions and fault resistances. © 2016 Chin.

Shipin Kexue/Food Sc.,"In this research, the kinetic mechanism of sucrose release from whey protein isolate gels was studied. For this purpose, sucrose as a food flavor component was encapsulated in whey protein gels to investigate the effects of pH, temperature, drug loading, and ion concentration on the kinetics of sucrose release. The results showed that the releasing process of sucrose from whey protein isolate gels could be described by the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, with a fitting correlation coefficient R2between 0.95-0.99. The diffusion constant n was less than 0.45, which is consistent with the Fick diffusion mechanism. With the increase of pH, temperature or ion concentration in the range of 0.05-0.10 mol/L, the kinetic constant K (i.e., release rate) increased, while it decreased with the increase of drug loading. Whey protein isolate gel exhibited environmental responses, and the release of entrapped sucrose from it could be influenced by pH, temperature, drug loading, ion concentration and other factors. Therefore, the purpose of controlling the release of entrapped contents from the carrier could be achieved by adjusting pH, temperature, drug concentration and ion concentration. © 2016, China Food Publishing Company.

J. Sep. Sci.,"A novel two-step extraction technique combining ionic-liquid-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction with magnetic solid-phase extraction was developed for the preconcentration and separation of aflatoxins in animal feedstuffs before high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection. In this work, ionic liquid 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate was used as the extractant in dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction, and hydrophobic pelargonic acid modified Fe3O4magnetic nanoparticles as an efficient adsorbent were applied to retrieve the aflatoxins-containing ionic liquid. Notably, the target of magnetic nanoparticles was the ionic liquid rather than the aflatoxins. Because of the rapid mass transfer associated with the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and magnetic solid phase steps, fast extraction could be achieved. The main parameters affecting the extraction recoveries of aflatoxins were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, vortexing at 2500 rpm for 1 min in the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and magnetic solid-phase extraction and then desorption by sonication for 2 min with acetonitrile as eluent. The recoveries were 90.3-103.7% with relative standard deviations of 3.2-6.4%. Good linearity was observed with correlation coefficients ranged from 0.9986 to 0.9995. The detection limits were 0.632, 0.087, 0.422 and 0.146 ng/mL for aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2, respectively.

Opt. Mater. Express,"Nd/Yb/Ho-doped hexagonal NaYF4nanocrystals were synthesized and excited at 808 nm to avoid an overheating effect under 980 nm laser excitation. A core/double-shell nanocomposite (NaYF4:Nd/Yb/Ho@SiO2@Ag nanoparticles) was then developed to enhance upconversion luminescence intensity. The fabricated system exhibited a metal-induced effect and was used to determine the influence of SiO2layer thickness on upconverting optical properties. SiO2layer with different thicknesses were used to adjust the distance between NaYF4nanocrystals and the outer layer of Ag nanocrystals. The largest enhancement of upconversion luminescence occurred when 10 nm-thick SiO2shell was used, with enhancement factors of 15 and 7.5 for green and red emissions, respectively. Results indicated that the degree of luminescence enhancement was correlated with the competition of the three interactions occurred between fluorophores and metal NPs. After coating with Ag nanoparticles, some modifications were found on the upconversion processes of NaYF4core nanoparticles and the underlying mechanisms were discussed respectively.

Shipin Kexue/Food Sc.,"The contents, absorption and accumulation of mineral elements in different parts of fruit bodies of 8 wild Boletus species collected from Yunnan province were investigated. The contents of 12 metal elements (Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cr, As, Cd, Pb, Li, and Ba) in stipes and caps were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after microwave digestion. All data obtained were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) through SPSS. The safety of Boletus consumption was evaluated on the basis of the mineral element data. The results showed that the recovery rates of 12 metals in a standard material GBW 10015 (spinach) ranged from 88% to 105% and the limits of detection (LODs) were 0.036-9.456 μg/L, indicating that the method is accurate and reliable. Both stipes and caps from eight wild Boletus species were rich in Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn and Cu. For most of the Boletus species studied, the contents of Zn, Mg, Cu, Cr and As were higher in caps than in stipes, whereas Li and Ba were higher in stipes than in caps. The levels of toxic heavy metals (Pb, As, Cd, Ni and Cr) were higher than the maximum levels of contaminants in foods according to the Chinese National Standard GB 2762-2012, suggesting potential health risks. The contents of 12 element contents in wild Boletus species were significantly different among 8 wild Boletus species and among different parts of the same species.

Shipin Kexue/Food Sc.,"This study was undertaken to investigate the distribution characteristics of mineral elements in wild Wolfiporia extensa. Fifteen elements including Li, Mg, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Cs, and Pb in the sclerotia of W. extensa collected from 28 regions of Yunnan province were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after microwave digestion. The measurement data were analyzed by SPSS through principle component analysis (PCA), correlation analysis, and cluster analysis (CA). The results showed that the correlation coefficients (r) of the linear regression equations of the anayte elements were all above 0.999 0, the measured values of standard reference materials were in agreement with the certified values, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were all below 8%. Hence this method is suitable for the determination of mineral elements of wild W. extensa because of its good precision and accuracy. Our analysis results indicated that wild W. extensa collected from Yunnan contained many kinds of mineral elements. The concentration levels of Ca (925.79 μg/g), K (370.42 μg/g), Mg (115.20 μg/g), and Fe (115.80 μg/g) were the highest, and the levels of toxic elements As and Pb were below the maximum safe limits stipulated in the Standard for Maximum Levels of Contaminants in Foods (GB 2762-2012) and the FAO/WHO standards. The results of PCA indicated that 4 principal components were chosen to examine the dataset which could explain 77.55% of the total variance. V, Fe, Li, As, Cs, Cr, Pb, Sr, Ca, and Mn were inferred to be the characteristic elements in wild W. extensa. The results of correlation analysis and CA were in agreement with PCA. All the tested elements could be grouped into three clusters: Fe, V, Li, Cs, As, and Cr as the first cluster; and Pb, K, Rb, Zn, Mg, and Cu as the second cluster; and Mn, Ca and Sr as the third cluster. The results of CA indicated that there were significant differences in the contents of mineral elements mainly because the mineral element contents of wild W. extensa were greatly influenced by the topography and climate characteristics of Yunnan province. © 2016, China Food Publishing Company.

Gaodianya Jishu,"Ice-melting ground wire insulation erection affects the short-circuited shunt distribution and the tower grounding safety performance. In order to ensure the grounding safety of tower, we established the short-circuit simulation model of insulated ground wire, and discussed the relationship between insulated gap breakdowns of ground wire and short-circuit current. Then we analyzed the tower grounding current of ice-melting insulated ground wire and the effects of the grounding safety of tower after erecting insulated ground wire. The results show that tower grounding current is mainly decided by insulated gap breakdowns after erecting insulated ground wire. When critical breakdown occurs in the gap of insulated ground wire, there will be large tower grounding current, which seriously threatens the grounding safety of tower. When ground wire is directly grounded, the safety performance of tower grounding devices can meet the requirements of regulations on the whole; while after erecting insulated ground wire, the safety performance of tower grounding devices can not meet the requirements of regulations. Therefore, the erection of insulated ground wire can seriously affect the grounding safety of tower. © 2016, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Huagong Xuebao,"Graphite oxide was prepared from flake graphite by Hummers method and dispersed by ultrasonic treatment. The amorphous Ni-B/rGO composite catalysts were prepared by one-step chemical reduction with NaBH4as reducing agent, and tested in the catalytic hydrogenation of pinene as the probing reaction. It shows that the as-prepared catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity and relatively high enantioselectivity of 96.5% for cis-pinane, which is better than the traditional Raney nickel and even noble metal catalysts. The catalyst possessed good stability, evidenced by that after 8-times testing cycles, both the conversion of pinene and the enantioselectivity to cis-pinane remained at a good level. The structure and properties of amorphous Ni-B/rGO composite catalysts were measured by XRD, XPS, TEM techniques, and the relationship between the catalytic performance and the structure was explored. The higher activity of the Ni-B/rGO amorphous catalyst could be attributed to the highly uniform dispersion of the Ni-B active species with unique electronic structure, and the interaction between Ni-B active species and the rGO in the composite catalysts. © All Right Reserved.",,20164402973681,,"Zhang, Jiahua (1); Jiang, Lihong (1); Wu, Shuisheng (1); Wang, Hongqin (1); Wang, Yaming (1) ","(1) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",HUKHAI,547.1 Precious Metals - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933.2 Amorphous Solids - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Amorphous materials - Catalysis - Composite materials - Electronic structure - Enantioselectivity - Graphene oxide - Graphite - Hydrogenation - Monoterpenes - Nickel compounds - Precious metals - Sodium Borohydride,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yaming(wym@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.11949/j.issn.0438-1157.20151703,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: U1202265, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",Foundation item: supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1202265).,,04381157,6,"June 1, 2016",Chinese,Catalyst activity,,22.0,2363-2370,,2016,Chemical Industry Press,Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal,,Preparation of amorphous Ni-B/graphene composites for catalytic hydrogenation of pinene,,Amorphous catalysts - Catalytic hydrogenation - Catalytic performance - Grapheme - High enantioselectivity - Noble metal catalysts - Structure and properties - Ultrasonic treatments,67

Jisuanji Fuzhu Sheji Yu Tuxingxue Xuebao,"In the study of computational aesthetics, high-resolution paintings always are used to analyze painting style, but actually the paintings we obtain mostly are low-resolution. In order to analyze the effect of image quality for visual art analysis, the contrast experiments are carried out between high and low resolution paintings in this paper. The sparse coding is used to train basis functions, different features are extracted in frequency domain and Gabor domain from the basis function. Then the normalized mutual information (NMI) is figured out to analyze the difference between high and low resolution painting features in analyzing the painting style. At last, the features with better performance are used to classify the painting style. The results show that, to a certain extent, features extracted from low-resolution paintings still have the ability to characterize the painting style, among which the Gabor energy has the best effect in painting style analysis. That is to say features extracted from low-resolution paintings can be used in painting style analysis. © 2016, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co. Ltd.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"A novel approach to synthesize molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles using a MIL-101 support (a type of metal-organic framework) is reported herein for the first time; the sample is referred as MIL@MIP. The nanoparticles were well distributed within the polymer film, and exhibit an octahedral shape, satisfied thermal stability, and a high specific surface area (SSA) of 1579.43m2g-1. The adsorption behavior of MIL@MIP toward metolcarb in aqueous solution was subsequently examined. The synthesized MIL@MIP displayed satisfactory high transfer mass rates and a high selective adsorption affinity for metolcarb. Based on these results, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor based on MIL@MIP was subsequently constructed and examined for the sensitive detection of metolcarb. Under optimal conditions, the detection limit of the system assessed in pear juice was 0.0689mgL-1within a linear concentration range of 0.1-0.9mgL-1. MIL@MIP-QCM system combines the advantages of MIL-101 and molecularly imprinted technology (MIT), thereby achieving high detection sensitivity and selectivity. The current findings suggest the potential of MIL@MIP for detecting trace level pesticides and veterinary drugs for food safety and environmental control. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20160401850535,,"Qian, Kun (1); Deng, Qiliang (1); Fang, Guozhen (2); Wang, Junping (2); Pan, Mingfei (2); Wang, Shuo (2); Pu, Yuehong (3) ","(1) College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin; 300457, China (2) Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin; 300457, China (3) Institute of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Yunnan; 650201, China ",BBIOE4,"454.1 Environmental Engineering, General - 482.2 Minerals - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 812.3 Glass - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 822.3 Food Products - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments",,,,,Chemical contamination - Crystalline materials - Drug delivery - Environmental management - Fruit juices - Metal nanoparticles - Organic polymers - Organometallics - Polymer films - Quartz - Semiconducting films - Sol-gel process - Sol-gels - Solutions - Synthesis (chemical),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shuo(s.wang@tust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.bios.2015.12.071,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,"Number: 2012AA101604, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: 2012CB720803, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31225021, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; Number: 2012HA009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National High-tech R&D Program (863 Program) financial supports from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Project No. 2012AA101604 ), National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (Grant no. 31225021 ), National Basic Research Program (973) of China (Project no. 2012CB720803 ), and Innovation Talents of Science and Technology Plan of Yunnan Province (Project no. 2012HA009 ).

An algorithm of Hybrid BBBC with the objective to minimize the makespan is presented to tackle the job-shop scheduling problem. The initial solutions to the typical NP-hard problem are generated according to different heuristic strategies in a combination way. Modified BB strategy is proposed by treating the obtained operations to generate the center of mass. And then all the operations are ordered by the positions of the operations obtained in BC phase. To enhance the exploitation ability, a local search strategy is proposed on basis of critical path to moving the operation sequence toward the promising solution.

This paper proposes a driven model recovery method, which is challenging in fluid resimulation customization. First, fluid physical properties are calculated under the constraints of appearance and dynamic behavior of the example water. Second, a hybrid particle lattice Boltzmann method for shallow water (LBMSW) is recovered from the dynamic geometry on fluid surface. As it is found that the resimulation details fade gradually with LBMSW auto-advection, a physically-based enhancement scheme is presented. A nonlinear algorithm is introduced to stretch the faded density to retain resimulation details.

A vital issue in distributed compressed sensing is to minimize the difference between the original signal and the recovery signal. In this paper, we improve the distributed compressed sensing for smooth signals in wireless sensor networks. Firstly, we put forward a new weighted method to obtain the common component of all signals, and then one method of lossy coding for shortening the length of common component is proposed. Most importantly, we improve the calculation formula of the distributed compressed sensing to ensure that the common component can be received losslessly. The numerical results show that, comparing with the distributed compressed sensing, the improved distributed compressed sensing not only can use much fewer measurements to recover the original signal, but also enable the effect of signal recovery to be better than that of traditional distributed compressed sensing. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163802815359,7546445.0,"Li, Boyu (1); Gao, Fei (1); Liu, Xiaoyu (1); Wang, Xia (1) ","(1) Key Lab of Wireless Sensor Networks, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment,123384.0,"July 6, 2016 - July 8, 2016","Kunming, China","2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, CITS 2016",Compressed sensing - Computer system recovery - Recovery - Signal reconstruction - Signaling,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gao, Fei(ynkmgaofei@163.com) ",10.1109/CITS.2016.7546445,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509034406.0,,,"August 16, 2016",English,Wireless sensor networks,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",12.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks (ISN); Xidian University; Yunnan Minzu University,Improved distributed compressed sensing for smooth signals in wireless sensor networks,,Calculation formula - Distributed Compressed Sensing - JSM-1 - Numerical results - Signal recovery - Smooth - Weighted method - Wireless sensors networks,
"Sens Actuators, B Chem","Hollow CuO fibers were successfully fabricated using a facile solution combustion method by incorporating cotton fibers as biotemplate. XRD patterns along with Rietveld refinement confirm the formation of CuO with monoclinic phase. The length of the as-synthesized CuO fibers is at micrometer scale, and the average fiber diameter ranges from several nanometers up to order of micrometers. After combustion reaction, a large amount of coalescent particles left on the surface of the cotton fibers to form porous walls of CuO. By totally removing cotton body at 600 °C, hollow CuO fibers were obtained. A possible growth mechanism of hollow CuO fibers using cotton fibers as templates was given based on experimental data. When used as a sensing material in gas sensor, it exhibited a superior sensitivity and good selectivity toward low-ppm-level (1-100 ppm) n-propanol. Theses findings not only provide a novel approach to fabricate hollow CuO fibers via a solution combustion route, but also explore a promising gas sensor toward n-propanol. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

IEEE Trans Multimedia,"With the rapid development of wearable sensors and pervasive computing technologies including smartphones, acceleration-based human activity recognition is receiving increased attention for medical research applications. Motivated by the 'weightlessness' feature, here we apply a bidirectional feature during the feature extraction phase of activity recognition; however, since the bidirectional feature has two components, they cannot simply be concatenated into a long vector, but can be naturally treated as a second-order tensor. Therefore, we propose a new tensor-based feature selection method termed tensor manifold discriminant projections (TMDP). TMDP simultaneously considers: 1) applying an optimization criterion that can directly process the tensor spectral analysis problem, thereby decreasing the computational cost compared to traditional tensor-based feature selection methods; 2) extracting local rank information by finding a tensor subspace that preserves the rank order information of the within-class input samples; and 3) extracting discriminant information by maximizing the sum of distances between every sample and their interclass sample mean. Experiments on the naturalistic mobile devices-based human activity 2.0 dataset are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TMDP. © 2016 IEEE.",,20164002865427,7527644.0,"Guo, Yanan (1); Tao, Dapeng (2); Cheng, Jun (3, 4); Dougherty, Alan (5); Li, Yaotang (1); Yue, Kun (2); Zhang, Bob (6) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Laboratory for Human Machine Control, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen; 518055, China (4) Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong (5) Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong (6) Department of Computer and Information Science, Macau University, 999078, China ",ITMUF8,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 921.1 Algebra - 943.1 Mechanical Instruments,,,,,Accelerometers - Big data - mHealth - Spectrum analysis - Tensors - Ubiquitous computing - Wearable technology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TMM.2016.2597007,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,15209210,10,October 2016,English,Feature extraction,,53.0,1977-1987,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,,Tensor Manifold Discriminant Projections for Acceleration-Based Human Activity Recognition,,Discriminant informations - Feature selection methods - Human activity recognition - Optimization criteria - Pervasive computing technology - Rank order - Second-order tensors - Tensor representation,18

Rock Soil Mech,"Generally, the tunnel-type anchorage in the suspension bridge has a strong capacity to resist the uplift load due to the appearance of the wedge. In this study, two failure modes, i. e. friction damage on the anchor interface and the surrounding rock rupture owing to lateral extrusion, are investigated based on the assumption of homogeneous surrounding rock and Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion. According to the distribution of the force on interface between anchors and rock, the equilibrium conditions are established to further analyze the change of stress on rupture surface within the surrounding rocks. Besides, the wedge-effect coefficients of the tunnel-type anchorage with respect to two failure modes are derived, comparing with the pull-out capacity of the anchorage with constant section. Subsequently, the formulations about the pull-out bearing capacity of tunnel-type anchorage are obtained under these two failure modes. Research results show that the wedge-effect on the pull-out bearing capacity of the tunnel-type anchorage has obvious regularities for different classes of surrounding rock. Finally, the calculated results by the proposed procedure are compared with measured values of the built tunnel-type anchorage. It is shown that the proposed procedure is reasonable to consider the wedge-effect for the bearing capacity of the tunnel-type anchorage. © 2016, Academia Sinica.

According to the fact that the fused image and the source inputs should have the same or similar structure tensor, the energy functional of the image fusion and super-resolution is established combining with the down-sampling operator. For edge enhancement, the bidirectional diffusion term is incorporated into the image fusion and super-resolution model to enhance the visualization of the fused image. In the noise suppression term, a new variational model is developed based on the fractional differential and fractional total variation. Thanks to the above three terms, the proposed model can realize the image fusion, super-resolution, and the edge information enhancement simultaneously. To search for the optimal solution, a gradient descent iteration scheme derived from the Euler-Lagrange equation of the proposed model is employed. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method is feasible and effective. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20152801022510,,"Li, Huafeng (1, 2); Yu, Zhengtao (1); Mao, Cunli (1) ","(1) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan, Kunming; 650500, China (2) College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China ",NRCGEO,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Equations of motion - Image enhancement - Iterative methods - Numerical methods - Optical resolving power - Spurious signal noise - Tensors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Huafeng(hfchina99@163.com) ",10.1016/j.neucom.2015.06.035,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18728286,"Number: Yunnan, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: -, Acronym: NEU, Sponsor: Northeastern University; Number: -, Acronym: SWU, Sponsor: Southwest University; Number: 2013FD011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: KKSY201403116, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: KKSY20130 3086, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61302041, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: KKZ3201303027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","The authors would first like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive and valuable comments and suggestions.

RSC Adv.,"Oleic acid capped Fe3O4nanoparticles with a size range of 8-15 nm were prepared by a typical reduction method. Double bonds in the oleic acid molecules were activated and further grafted with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) in butyl acetate to obtain acrylate copolymer-coated Fe3O4nanoparticles. Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) was used as the cross-linking agent to immobilize the surface structure of the nanoparticles. Fe3O4templates were then disposed of with excessive concentrated HCl solution, and monodispersed ultra-fine and an ultra-light hollow polymer/iron eutectic system with a size range of 18-30 nm was thus obtained. The molecular structures, crystal information, thermal properties, and morphology of the prepared nano-particles were characterized. The results showed that the hollow nanoparticles were composed of an amorphous outer layer and a crystalline inner layer, and that the outer layer and the inner layer mainly consisted of acrylate copolymers and ordered iron oxide atoms, respectively. The cross-linked macromolecular architectures and the chemical bond between Fe atoms and polymeric chains are the main driving force to form such a hollow eutectic system that has never been reported previously. The preparation method reported in this paper firstly develops a route to synthesize hollow polymer/metal eutectic materials, and these hollow nanoparticles have large potential application in the fields of nanoreactors and catalysts. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20161102083895,,"Bao, Lixia (1, 2); Zou, Xin (1); Luo, Xin (1); Pu, Yanlei (1); Lei, Jingxin (2); Cao, Qiue (1); Wang, Jiliang (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610065, China ",RSCACL,531.2 Metallography - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Acrylic monomers - Chemical bonds - Chlorine compounds - Crosslinking - Esters - Eutectics - Iron oxides - Macromolecules - Magnetite - Nanoparticles - Oleic acid - Polymers - Synthesis (chemical),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Jiliang(jlwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6ra01754a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 21204076/B040307, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the grant No. 21204076/B040307.,,,27,2016,English,Nanocatalysts,,28.0,23016-23024,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Monodispersed hollow polymer/iron eutectic nanospheres,,Acrylate copolymers - Cross linking agents - Fe3O4 nanoparticles - Hexamethylene diisocyanate - Hollow nanoparticles - Hydroxyethyl acrylate - Macromolecular architecture - Methyl methacrylates,6

AIP Adv.,"Doping with hetero-atoms is an effective way to tune the properties of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Here, potassium-doped GQDs (K-GQDs) are synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal treatment of sucrose and potassium hydroxide solution. Optical properties of the GQDs are altered as a result of K-doping. The absorption peaks exhibit a blue shift. Multiple photoluminescence (PL) peaks are observed as the excitation wavelength is varied from 380 nm to 620 nm. New energy levels are introduced into the K-GQDs and provide alternative electron transition pathways. The maximum PL intensity of the K-GQDs is obtained at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm which is distinct from the undoped GQDs (375 nm). The strong PL of the K-GQDs at the longer emission wavelengths is expected to make K-GQDs more suitable for bioimaging and optoelectronic applications. © 2016 Author(s).",Open Access,20163102670293,75116.0,"Qian, Fuli (1); Li, Xueming (1); Tang, Libin (2); Lai, Sin Ki (3); Lu, Chaoyu (1); Lau, Shu Ping (3) ","(1) Solar Energy Research Institute, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China (2) Kunming Institute of Physics, Kunming; 650223, China (3) Department of Applied Physics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, Hong Kong ",,714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Electron transitions - Graphene - Nanocrystals - Potassium hydroxide - Semiconductor quantum dots,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1063/1.4959906,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),21583226,"Number: 2012FA003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 51462037, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61106098 and No. 51462037), and the Key Project of Applied Basic Research of Yunnan Province, China (No. 2012FA003).",,,7,"July 1, 2016",English,Optical properties,,31.0,,,2016,American Institute of Physics Inc.,AIP Advances,,Potassium doping: Tuning the optical properties of graphene quantum dots,,Absorption peaks - Emission wavelength - Excitation wavelength - Hydrothermal treatments - Optoelectronic applications - PL intensity - Potassium doping - Potassium hydroxide solution,6
MATEC Web Conf.,"The storage systems have been challenged by the development of cloud computing. The traditional data index cannot satisfy the requirements of cloud computing because of the huge index volumes and quick response time. Meanwhile, because of the increasing size of data index and its dynamic characteristics, the previous ways, which rebuilding the index or fully backup the index before the data has changed, cannot satisfy the need of today's big data index. To solve these problems, we propose a double-layer index structure that overcomes the throughput limitation of single point server.

Energy,"The utilization of helical coils in supercritical CO2Rankine cycles faces some challenges, among which an urgent one is the quantification of the interaction between curvature and buoyancy effects. In this work flow and heat transfer of supercritical CO2in helically coiled tubes was investigated over a wide range of fluid temperature, mass flux, heat flux and coil geometries. A dimensionless buoyancy parameter, Rig,CT, was introduced to quantify those two effects on average heat transfer. When Rig, CT > 8 the curvature effect was overwhelmed by gravitational buoyancy effect and helically coiled tubes present similar performance with straight tubes. On the other hand, when Rig, CT  10, buoyancy has little impact and centrifugal force dominates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20164302933686,,"Li, Zhouhang (1, 2); Zhai, Yuling (1); Li, Kongzhai (1); Wang, Hua (1); Lu, Junfu (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing; 100084, China ",ENEYDS,"616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 619.1 Pipe, Piping and Pipelines - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Buoyancy - Carbon dioxide - Heat flux - Heat transfer - Rankine cycle - Tubes (components),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhouhang(lizh@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2016YFB0600201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",This work is financially supported by the National Key Research & Development Program of China (No. 2016YFB0600201 ).,,03605442,,"December 1, 2016",English,Heat exchangers,,35.0,661-676,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Energy,,A quantitative study on the interaction between curvature and buoyancy effects in helically coiled heat exchangers of supercritical CO2Rankine cycles,,Average heat transfers - Buoyancy effect - Curvature effect - Dimensionless number - Heat transfer characteristics - Helically coiled tubes - Quantitative characterization - Supercritical CO2,116
IEEE Trans. Cybern.,"Chinese character font recognition (CCFR) has received increasing attention as the intelligent applications based on optical character recognition becomes popular. However, traditional CCFR systems do not handle noisy data effectively. By analyzing in detail the basic strokes of Chinese characters, we propose that font recognition on a single Chinese character is a sequence classification problem, which can be effectively solved by recurrent neural networks. For robust CCFR, we integrate a principal component convolution layer with the 2-D long short-term memory (2DLSTM) and develop principal component 2DLSTM (PC-2DLSTM) algorithm. PC-2DLSTM considers two aspects: 1) the principal component layer convolution operation helps remove the noise and get a rational and complete font information and 2) simultaneously, 2DLSTM deals with the long-range contextual processing along scan directions that can contribute to capture the contrast between character trajectory and background. Experiments using the frequently used CCFR dataset suggest the effectiveness of PC-2DLSTM compared with other state-of-the-art font recognition methods. © 2015 IEEE.",,20151400716652,7073574.0,"Tao, Dapeng (1); Lin, Xu (2); Jin, Lianwen (2); Li, Xuelong (3) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou; 510640, China (3) Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning (OPTIMAL), State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, Shaanxi; 710119, China ",,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Brain - Convolution - Long short-term memory - Optical character recognition,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TCYB.2015.2414920,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 20120172110023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20140901003939001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014A030310252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 2013BAH65F01, Acronym: NPST, Sponsor: National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation; Number: 2013BAH65F04, Acronym: NPST, Sponsor: National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation; Number: 2012KCT-04, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Youth Science and Technology Innovation Team; Number: 61075021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61125106, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472144, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2012A010701001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012B091100396, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61125106, Grant 61075021, and Grant 61472144, in part by the National Science and Technology Support Plan under Grant 2013BAH65F01 and Grant 2013BAH65F04, in part by the Guangdong Natural Science Funds under Grant 2014A030310252, in part by the Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme under Grant 2011, in part by the Guangdong Scientific and Technology Research Plan under Grant 2012A010701001 and Grant 2012B091100396, in part by the Shenzhen Technology Project under Grant JCYJ20140901003939001, in part by the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China under Grant 20120172110023, in part by the Shaanxi Key Innovation Team of Science and Technology under Grant 2012KCT-04, and in part by the Opening Project of State Key Laboratory of Digital Publishing Technology.",,21682267,3,March 2016,English,Principal component analysis,,59.0,756-765,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,,Principal Component 2-D Long Short-Term Memory for Font Recognition on Single Chinese Characters,,Chinese characters - Font recognition - Intelligent applications - Neurodynamic models - Principal Components - Recurrent neural network (RNNs) - Sequence classification - State of the art,46
Dianwang Jishu,"Large-scale integration and accommodation of multi-characteristic small hydropower is an urgent problem for power grids in China. A weak damping oscillation mode exists in western Yunnan power grid, where large-scale small hydropower is delivered in concentration. And this is the major constraint limiting transmission capacity of this area. To avoid weak damping oscillations of whole gridtriggered bylarge-scale small hydropower, VSC-HVDC systemscan be used to connect smallhydropower concentrated grids to backbone grid asynchronously to electrically isolate machine groups with largest participation factor from machine groups in backbone grid. This paper designed a VSC-HVDC back-to-back asynchronous interconnection scheme forenhancing economy and reducing DC system faultprobability. Besides, from perspective of optimizing power flow distribution of smallhydropower concentrated grids, a VSC-MTDC asynchronous interconnection scheme was designed. Effects of the two schemes on system small-signal stability and transmission capacity of small-hydropower concentrated grids were compared. Simulation results showed that both schemes could enhance small-signal stability of Yunnan grid and increase transmission capacity of smallhydropower concentrated grids effectively. © 2016, Power System Technology Press.

J. S. Afr. Inst. Min. Metall.,"Microwave sulphating roasting was applied to zinc oxide fume from a fuming furnace for the removal of F and Cl. The effect of important parameters such as roasting temperature, holding time. and vapour flow were investigated and the process conditions were optimized using response surface methodology. The results showed that the effects of roasting temperature and holding time on the removal efficiency of F and Cl were most significant, and the effect of vapour flow is of much lower importance. The defluorination and dechlorination efficiency increased rapidly as the roasting temperature and holding time increased, while the vapour flow had little effect. The defluorination efficiency could reach 91.3% while the dechlorination efficiency could reach 89.5%, under the process conditions of roasting temperature 655°C, holding time 65.2 minutes, and vapour flow of 6.8 ml/min.

Environ. Pollut.,"An on-site field-scale bioreactor for passive treatment of antimony (Sb) contamination was installed downstream of an active Sb mine in Southwest China, and operated for one year (including a six month monitoring period). This bioreactor consisted of five treatment units, including one pre-aerobic cell, two aerobic cells, and two microaerobic cells. With the aerobic cells inoculated with indigenous mine water microflora, the bioreactor removed more than 90% of total soluble Sb and 80% of soluble antimonite (Sb(III)). An increase in pH and decrease of oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) was also observed along the flow direction. High-throughput sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene variable (V4) region revealed that taxonomically diverse microbial communities developed in the bioreactor. Metal (loid)-oxidizing bacteria including Ferrovum, Thiomonas, Gallionella, and Leptospirillum, were highly enriched in the bioreactor cells where the highest total Sb and Sb(III) removal occurred. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that a suite of in situ physicochemical parameters including pH and Eh were substantially correlated with the overall microbial communities. Based on an UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) tree and PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis), the microbial composition of each cell was distinct, indicating these in situ physicochemical parameters had an effect in shaping the indigenous microbial communities. Overall, this study was the first to employ a field-scale bioreactor to treat Sb-rich mine water onsite and, moreover, the findings suggest the feasibility of the bioreactor in removing elevated Sb from mine waters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult.,"Abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone, plays crucial roles in plant growth, development and response to environmental stress. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) also has emerged similar functions, but interaction between ABA and H2S in the acquisition of heat tolerance is not clear. In this study, pretreatment of tobacco suspension cultured cells with ABA improved the survival percentage and regrowth ability, alleviated a decrease in cell vitality, increase in malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage of cells under heat stress, suggesting that ABA pretreatment could improve the heat tolerance of tobacco cells. In addition, treatment with ABA induced the accumulation of endogenous H2S in both tobacco cells and culture medium, increased the activity of l-cysteine desulfhydrase, a key enzyme in H2S biosynthesis. Also, ABA-induced heat tolerance was enhanced by addition of NaHS, a H2S donor, but weakened by dl-propargylglycine (specific inhibitor of H2S biosynthesis) and hypotaurine (H2S scavenger) respectively. These results suggest that ABA pretreatment could improve the heat tolerance of tobacco suspension cultured cells, and H2S, at least partly, mediated the acquisition of heat tolerance induced by ABA. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,20160101761552,,"Li, Zhong-Guang (1, 2, 3); Jin, Jia-Zheng (1, 2, 3) ","(1) School of Life Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China (2) Engineering Research Center of Sustainable Development and Utilization of Biomass Energy, Ministry of Education, Kunming; 650092, China (3) Key Laboratory of Biomass Energy and Environmental Biotechnology, Yunnan Province, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",PTCEDJ,"461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Amino acids - Biochemistry - Biosynthesis - Body fluids - Cells - Cytology - Electrolytes - Plants (botany) - Sodium compounds - Sulfur compounds - Sulfur determination - Suspensions (fluids) - Thermal stress - Tobacco,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhong-Guang(zhongguang_li@163.com) ",10.1007/s11240-015-0939-4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15735044,,,,01676857,2,"May 1, 2016",English,Hydrogen sulfide,,42.0,207-214,,2016,Springer Netherlands,"Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture",,Hydrogen sulfide partly mediates abscisic acid-induced heat tolerance in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) suspension cultured cells,,Abscisic acid - Heat stress - Heat tolerance - Signal crosstalk - Suspension-cultured cells,125

Aust. J. Chem.,"The discrimination of Pt-GG adducts by mismatch repair proteins, DNA damage-recognition proteins, and translation DNA polymerases was thought to be vital in determining the toxicity, efficacy, and mutagenicity of platinum anti-tumour drugs. Studies on cis-diammine-Pt-GG (from cisplatin and carboplatin) and trans-R,R-diaminocyclohexane (DACH)-Pt-GG indicated that these proteins recognized the differences in conformation and conformational dynamics of Pt-DNA complexes. However, the structural basis of enantiomeric DACH-Pt-GG forms is unclear. Molecular dynamics simulations results presented here reveal that the conformational dynamics between trans-R,R-DACH-Pt-GG, trans-S,S-DACH-Pt-GG, cis-DACH-Pt-GG and undamaged DNA are distinct and depend on the chirality of DACH though their major conformations are similar. Trans-DACH-Pt was found to be energetically favoured over cis-DACH-Pt to form DNA adducts. Moreover, oxaliplatin and its cis-DACH analogues were found to preferentially form hydrogen bonds on the 3′ side of the Pt-GG adduct, whereas the S,S-DACH-Pt preferred the 5′ side. A three-centre hydrogen bond formed between cis1-DACH-Pt and DNA was observed, and the differences in hydrogen bond formation are highly correlated with differences in DNA conformational dynamics. Based on these results, it is suggested that the different bioactivities of oxaliplatin and its enantiomeric analogues were controlled by the difference in hydrogen bonds formation dynamics between DNA and the Pt moiety. Our molecular dynamics approach was demonstrated to be applicable to the study of stereoisomer conformations of platinum-DNA model, thereby suggesting its potential application as a tool for the study and design of new effective platinum-based drugs. © 2016 CSIRO.",,20161702302992,,"Yang, Jing (1); Chen, Jing (2); Li, Zibiao (3) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, 9 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore; 117576, Singapore (2) Experimental Center, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yuhua Road, #1076, Chenggong District, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (3) Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), 2 Fusionopolis Way, Innovis, #09-52, Singapore; 138634, Singapore ",AJCHAS,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.8.2 Bioinformatics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Bioinformatics - Conformations - DNA - Enantiomers - Hydrogen bonds - Molecular dynamics - Proteins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Jing(sunnychenj@163.com) ",10.1071/CH15624,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14450038,,,,00049425,4,2016,English,Platinum compounds,,45.0,379-387,,2016,CSIRO,Australian Journal of Chemistry,,Structural Basis for the Structure-Activity Behaviour of Oxaliplatin and its Enantiomeric Analogues: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Platinum-DNA Intrastrand Crosslink Adducts,,Conformational dynamics - Formation dynamics - Highly-correlated - Hydrogen-bond formation - Mismatch repair - Molecular dynamics simulations - Structural basis - Structure activity,69

Adv. Power. Energy Eng. Proc. Asia-Pac. Power. Energy Eng. Conf.,"Partial Discharge (PD) detection is an important method to assess the condition of the electrical insulation of HV power cables. The identification of reflected pulse is directly relevant to the inspection results and the PD source positioning accuracy in a PD measurement. But the reflected pulse that is automatically selected by the PD check system often suffers from a lack of precision, and needs correction by the operators based on their personal experiences. But there are still no specific criteria on how to determine the PD reflected pulse accurately. In this paper, a MATLAB/Simulink model is set up to simulate the PD pulse propagation in the power cable. A large number of PD measurements for different length preset fault cables and corresponding simulations prove that by using simulation software setup, the corresponding simulation model, the simulation results of the PD original pulse and the PD reflected pulse can help the operators to locate the true reflected pulse.

J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci.,"For the type of upstream tailings dam, seepage is one of the important factors that affect the stability of the tailings dam. In this paper, the experimental research model for tailings material is established, with three different concentrator tailings as the research object to analyze the seepage stability influence caused by particle size distribution characteristics. According to the experimental analysis, by fitting the tailings void ratio and permeability coefficient, the mathematical relationship between tailings void ratio and permeability coefficient is established. The results show that three samples of tailings void ratio and permeability coefficient are in line with the distribution of the exponential function, and tailings permeability coefficient k and void ratio e is monotonically increasing curve under other conditions remain unchanged. Combined with particle size grading curve, analyze the relationship between tailings particle size and permeability coefficient through fitting curve with the void ratio under the certain condition, and obtain permeability coefficient is proportional to the tailings void ratio, thus shows exponential relationship. Namely with tailings particle size increases (decreases), the permeability coefficient also increases (decreases), and which has a significant influence on the tailings dam seepage state. © Copyright 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",,20163102675755,,"Yuan, Liwei (1); Li, Xuemei (1); Li, Sumin (1); Peng, Xiao (1); Chen, Yuming (1); Wang, Guangjin (1) ","(1) Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",,441.1 Dams - 452.3 Industrial Wastes - 632.1 Hydraulics - 741.1 Light/Optics - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Convergence of numerical methods - Curve fitting - Embankment dams - Exponential functions - Grading - Hydraulic conductivity - Light transmission - Particle size - Seepage - Size distribution - Tailings,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Sumin ",10.1166/jctn.2016.4600,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15461963,,,,15461955,4,April 2016,English,Particle size analysis,,16.0,2444-2448,,2016,American Scientific Publishers,Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience,,Experimental Study on the influence of particle size distribution on the tailings seepage state,,Experimental analysis - Experimental research - Fitting analysis - Mathematical relationship - Particle size grading - Research object - Seepage stability - Void ratios,13
Mater. Trans.,"A two-dimensional finite element model of aluminum foam sandwich (AFS) panels was approximated by combing C++ and ANSYS/LSDYNA software to represent the shapes of the cells and geometric distributions. Under different loading rates, the deformation behavior, shock wave propagation process, inertial effect and stress of the bottom of the model of AFS panels are discussed resulting from simulation. We found that plastic deformation in the model first occurs in a weak section in the quasi-static compression simulation, whereas the local densification is obvious during the high-speed impact process. The results also indicate that the speed of the plastic wave, locking density and locking strain increase respectively with increasing loading rate. In addition, under the loading rate 80m/s, the model can be compressed after the plastic wave reaches the bottom of the model during the process of deformation due to the reflection of the plastic wave, whereas the plateau stress rises with an increase in the loading rate. © 2016 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.",Open Access,20160801991993,,"Dou, Renjun (1); Qiu, Sawei (1); Ju, Yan (1) ","(1) Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Chenggong University Town, Jingming South Road, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",MTARCE,"408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 541.1 Aluminum - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.1.1 Computer Programming Languages - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Aluminum - C++ (programming language) - Computer software - Honeycomb structures - Locks (fasteners) - Probability distributions - Sandwich structures - Shock waves - Stress analysis - Wave propagation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Dou, Renjun(1320985749@qq.com) ",10.2320/matertrans.M2015359,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,13459678,2,2016,English,Finite element method,,14.0,99-102,,2016,Japan Institute of Metals (JIM),Materials Transactions,,Simulation of Effect of Loading Rate on Compression Properties in the Two-Dimensional Model of Aluminum Foam Sandwich Panels,,Aluminum foam sandwich panels - ANSYS/LS-DYNA - Compression properties - Deformation behavior - Geometric distribution - Plastic waves - Quasi-static compression - Two dimensional model,57

The morphology, crystal structure and optical properties of CoPc nanowires were characterized by SEM, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared and UV-visible spectroscopies. Analyses of X-ray diffraction patterns and Fourier transform infrared spectra indicate that the crystal structure of CoPc nanowires represents a new polymorph, which is designated J-CoPc. These J-CoPc nanowires with high directionality (average diameter ∼50 nm) surprisingly possess much broader optical absorption spectra in the visible spectral region than those of the α- and β-phase CoPc, enabling high potential for practical applications in novel molecular electronic/optical devices. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Mater. Trans.,The changes in the mechanical properties and microstructure of nanocrystalline Cu-Zn alloys deformed by cryorolling during low temperature annealing and the post-process deformation were studied. The deformed Cu-Zn alloys exhibited uncommon anneal hardening and deformation softening behaviors. The degree of anneal hardening and deformation softening increased with the addition of the solute atoms. X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy were employed to reveal the microstructure of the samples in different states. The annealing hardening effect is ascribed to the contribution of solute segregation to dislocation and short range ordering. © 2016 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.,Open Access,20163102656303,,"Yang, Jian (1); Pang, Yanzhao (1); Li, Peng (1); Yin, Zhe (1); Gong, Yulan (2); Zhu, Xinkun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",MTARCE,537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Binary alloys - Deformation - Hardening - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Mechanical properties - Microstructure - Nanocrystalline alloys - Nanocrystals - Temperature - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction analysis - Zinc alloys,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Xinkun(xk_zhu@hotmail.com) ",10.2320/matertrans.MG201618,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: KKSY201407100, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51561015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NCSU, Sponsor: North Carolina State University; ","The authors would like to acknowledge financial supports by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (grant 51561015), and the introduction of talents fund project of Kunming University of Science and Technology (grant KKSY201407100).

Ind. Crops Prod.,"Industrial hemp is one of the important natural green fiber crops and, up to now, there has been a lack of research on its salt tolerance and the metabolic molecular mechanisms involved. Study on the adaptive mechanisms to salt stress in hemp through comparative proteome analysis is one important way to solve this problem. In this paper, iTRAQ-based proteomics technology was first used to study the differential proteomics of leaves of seedling under salt stress (600 mM sodium chloride) for 4 days in salt-resistant industrial hemp and salt-sensitive varieties. There were 403 and 252 differential proteins identified through LC-ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry, respectively, and these were classified into 14 categories: primary metabolism, energy, protein destination and storage, disease/defense, protein synthesis, photosynthesis, transport, transcription, signal transduction, cell structure, secondary metabolism, intracellular traffic, cell growth/division and unknown. Hemp adapted to stress mainly by improved ATP metabolism, regulating photosynthesis according to light intensity, strengthening chlorophyll synthesis, promoting cell relaxation and enlargement, improving synthesis of osmoregulation substances, enhancing flow of inorganic sulfur in the body, regulating aquaporins, strengthening transmission of ion transport signals, improving signal transmission between proteins and between proteins and cytomembranes, improving selective absorption and transportation speed of organic and inorganic molecular, degrading hemicellulose cell walls, controlling transport of cellular material in and out, and promoting metabolism and cell stability.

IOP Conf. Ser. Earth Environ. Sci.,"To evaluate the optical performance of a CPC based concentrating photovoltaic system, it is essential to find the angular dependence of optical efficiency of compound parabolic concentrator (CPC-θe) where the incident angle of solar rays on solar cells is restricted within θefor the radiation over its acceptance angle. In this work, a mathematical procedure was developed to calculate the optical efficiency of CPC-θefor radiation incident at any angle based radiation transfer within CPC-θe. Calculations show that, given the acceptance half-angle (θa), the annual radiation of full CPC-θeincreases with the increase of θeand the CPC without restriction of exit angle (CPC-90) annually collects the most radiation due to large geometry (Ct); whereas for truncated CPCs with identical θa and Ct, the annual radiation collected by CPC-θeis almost identical to that by CPC-90, even slightly higher. Calculations also indicate that the annual radiation on the absorber of CPC-θeat the angle larger than θedecrease with the increase of θebut always less than that of CPC-90, and this implies that the CPC-θebased PV system is more efficient than CPC-90 based PV system because the radiation on solar cells incident at large angle is poorly converted into electricity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Open Access,20164903086699,12006.0,"Yu, Y.M.

J. Hazard. Mater.,"Mn-doped TiO2grown on reduced graphene oxide(rGO) was synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method and the photocatalytic removal of Cr by the material was investigated under sunlight. The materials were characterized by a combination of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cr(total) removal efficiency of the material is 97.32% in 30 min and 99.02% in 60 min under sunlight irradiation, as the initial concentration of Cr(VI) is 20 mg/L. The high photocatalytic activity under visible light is considered mainly due to the Mn-doping, and rGO plays an important role in the synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis to sustain the high efficient removal of Cr(VI) and Cr(III). Cr(VI) adsorbed on the surface of rGO is reduced to Cr(III) by photo electrons which are transported through rGO, and the reaction product Cr(III) continues to be adsorbed. The process contributes to the release of abundant photocatalytic sites of Mn-TiO2and improves photocatalytic efficiency. The excellent adsorption and photocatalytic effect with the explanation of the synergetic mechanism are very useful not only for fundamental research but also for the potential practical applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..",,20160902022116,,"Chen, Zengping (1); Li, Yaru (1); Guo, Meng (1); Xu, Fengyun (1); Wang, Peng (1); Du, Yu (2); Na, Ping (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin; 300072, China (2) China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial Co., Ltd., Yunnan; 651600, China ",JHMAD9,543.1 Chromium and Alloys - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Chromium - Efficiency - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy - Graphene - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Photocatalysis - Photocatalysts - Photoluminescence - Scanning electron microscopy - Thermogravimetric analysis - Titanium dioxide - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Na, Ping(naping@tju.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.02.034,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18733336,"Number: 19-3BC2014-02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012AA063504, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21276193, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013F1-0033, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission; Number: JSZX2014CP05, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission; ","This work was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (No. 2012AA063504), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21276193), Tianjin Municipal Natural Science Foundation (No. 2013F1-0033), the ST project of China Tobacco Yunnan industrial Co., Ltd., R&D center (No. JSZX2014CP05) and Project of Oil Spill and Oil Pollutant Disposal Technology in Tianjin (No. 19-3BC2014-02).

J. Biol. Chem.,"Collisions between DNA replication complexes (replisomes) and barriers such as damaged DNA or tightly bound protein complexes can dissociate replisomes from chromosomes prematurely. Replisomes must be reloaded under these circumstances to avoid incomplete replication and cell death. Bacteria have evolved multiple pathways that initiate DNA replication restart by recognizing and remodeling abandoned replication forks and reloading the replicative helicase. In vitro, the simplest of these pathways is mediated by the single-domain PriC protein, which, along with the DnaC helicase loader, can load the DnaB replicative helicase onto DNA bound by the singlestranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein (SSB). Previous biochemical studies have identified PriC residues that mediate interactions with ssDNA and SSB. However, the mechanisms by which PriC drives DNA replication restart have remained poorly defined due to the limited structural information available for PriC. Here, we report the NMR structure of full-length PriC from Cronobacter sakazakii. PriC forms a compact bundle of α-helices that brings together residues involved in ssDNA and SSB binding at adjacent sites on the protein surface. Disruption of these interaction sites and of other conserved residues leads to decreased DnaB helicase loading onto SSB-bound DNA. We also demonstrate that PriC can directly interact with DnaB and the DnaB-DnaC complex.

Although there are many ontology learning methods to acquire ontology from structured or unstructured data, it is still difficult to exclude logic errors using reinforcement learning on ontology construction. Ontology extension is a key step when the new knowledge adds into the existing ontology in the process ontology learning. This proposal designs and validates the method of ontology extension based on the axiomatic cognitive model, which include the ontology extension postulates, axioms and operations of the learning model.

Ceram Int,"The influence of doping with Ge on the nonlinear coefficient α and the breakdown electric field EBof TiO2-Ta2O5-CaCO3varistor ceramics was investigated. In this study, TiO2-Ta2O5-CaCO3varistor ceramics added with Ge was successfully prepared using the traditional method of ball milling-molding-sintering. The electrical performance, including the nonlinear coefficient α, the breakdown electric field EB, and the leakage current JL, are tested using a varistor direct current parameter instrument. The average barrier height ΦBof each sample is calculated using the relevant formula. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electronic microscopy analyses demonstrated that Ge doping notably changed the microstructure of TiO2-Ta2O5-CaCO3ceramics, thereby increasing α and decreasing EB. When the doping contents of Ta2O5and CaCO3were 0.2 and 0.4 mol%, respectively, the optimum doping content of 0.9 mol% Ge exhibited high α (10.2), low EB(14.1 V mm-1), and high ΦB(0.95 eV). These results are superior to previous findings. In addition, Ge as sintering aid reduced the sintering temperature caused by the low melting point. The optimal sintering temperature was 1300 °C for the TiO2-Ta2O5-CaCO3ceramics doped with Ge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",,20155101695460,,"Kang, Kunyong (1, 2, 3); Yan, Jikang (1, 2, 3); Gan, Guoyou (1, 2, 3); Du, Jinghong (1, 2, 3); Zhang, Jiamin (1, 2, 3); Liu, Yichun (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Precious Nonferrous Metals, Ministry of Education, Kunming; 650093, China ",CINNDH,549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 812.1 Ceramics,,,,,Ball milling - Calcite - Calcium carbonate - Ceramic materials - Electric breakdown - Electric fields - Germanium - Germanium compounds - Liquid phase sintering - Scanning electron microscopy - Tantalum oxides - Titanium dioxide - Varistors - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yan, Jikang(scyjk@163.com) ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.151,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: SKL-SPM-201502, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 14051708, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51262017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51362017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 51262017 and 51362017 ).

"Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Big Data Anal., ICBDA","Objective: Systematically review the value of second-trimester triple serum tests screening for Down's syndrome by using meta analysis. Method: The literature on PubMed, Journal of Medicine Library, CNKI, Web of Knowledge from January 2000 to April 2014 concerning second-trimester Down's syndrome screening was retrieved by computer or by hand. The literature was evaluated based on the QUADAS quality evaluation standard. The basic fourfold table data were extracted from the literature. Statistical analysis was conducted by using SPSS and Meta-Disc1.4. Results: Altogether 166 related articles were retrieved. According to the standard of literature selection and QUADAS quality evaluation, eventually 14 articles were brought into research. The meta analysis results of second-trimester triple serum tests screening for Down's syndrome were as follows: the sensitivity was 77%, the specificity was 93%, + LR was 13.92,-LR was 0.26, DOR was 40.82, the AUC of SROC was 0.9133, and Qâ - = 0.8458. In addition, the results of subgroup analyses based on age showed that the pooled sensitivity of high age group is higher than low age group, which indicated that the second-trimester serum triple serum tests screening for Down's syndrome could achieve better results for advanced maternal age. Conclusion: The second-trimester triple serum tests screening for Down's syndrome had a certain sensitivity and specificity, but for the regions with good medical and health care, they could consider increasing the serum screening indexes or adding ultrasound screening method so as to further improve the detection rate of Down's syndrome children and reduce the false-positive rate. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163302717677,7509847.0,"Li, Kai (1); Ma, Lei (1); Xiang, Yan (1); Han, Xiaodong (1); Li, Long (2); Zhu, Baosheng (3) ","(1) School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (2) Department of Medical Instruments, 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China (3) Genetic Diagnosis Center, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China ",,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 753.3 Ultrasonic Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control,122725.0,"March 12, 2016 - March 14, 2016","Hangzhou, China","2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data Analysis, ICBDA 2016",Big data - Body fluids - Data handling - Diagnosis - Information analysis - Testing - Ultrasonic applications,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICBDA.2016.7509847,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467395908.0,,,"July 12, 2016",English,Quality control,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data Analysis, ICBDA 2016",16.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data Analysis, ICBDA 2016",,Second-trimester triple serum tests in women screening for down's syndrome: A meta analysis,,Detection rates - Down's syndrome - False positive rates - Meta analysis - Quality evaluation - Sensitivity and specificity - Ultrasound screenings - Web of knowledge,

The structures of the samples were also investigated. Results indicate that n-/p-type single-crystal clathrates can be obtained by adjusting the initial content of Ga. Samples were determined to be n-type when the initial Ga content was X = 12, 13, and 14; and p-type when X = 16 and 18. The samples exhibited high melting points and large lattice parameters, as well as increasing Ga content. The electrical conductivities of the samples were lower than those prepared using the Sn self-flux method because of the low carrier concentration. The elemental composition of the sample was near the theoretical value when the Ga content was X = 14 and 16, which also yielded the highest Seebeck values of −523 μV/K and 331 V/K, respectively.

The morphological and crystallographic impact of varying flux of MAI is characterized using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffractometry. It was found that increasing organic flux results in large, angular, yet hollow nonuniformities growing within the film. Diffraction patterns show good perovskite crystallinity across all samples, but show texture development with the (220) diffraction peak growing in intensity relative to the (004) peak as organic content increases. A possible mechanism for the growth of these features is discussed.

Anal. Methods,"A novel electrochemical sensor for highly sensitive and selective detection of dopamine (DA) was developed based on a graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and Nafion composite modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). GQDs were synthesized by a hydrothermal approach for cutting graphene sheets into GQDs and characterized by TEM, UV-vis, photoluminescence, and FT-IR spectra. The GQDs had carboxyl groups with a negative charge, which not only provided good stability, but also enabled interaction with amine functional groups in DA through electrostatic interaction to enhance the specificity of DA. The interaction and electron communication between GQDs and DA can be further strengthened via π-π stacking force. Nafion was used as an anchoring agent to increase the robustness of GQDs on the electrode surface and sensor stability and reproducibility. The GQDs-Nafion composite exhibits a good linear range of 5 nM to 100 μM and a limit of detection as low as 0.45 nM in the detection of DA. The proposed electrochemical sensor also displays good selectivity and high stability and could be used for the determination of DA in real samples with satisfactory results.

AIP Adv.,"The unsubstituted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) single crystal nano columns were fabricated for the first time as chlorine (Cl2) gas sensors in this paper. The nano columns of CuPc have been prepared on different substrates via template-free physical vapor deposition (PVD) approach. The growth mechanism of CuPc nano column on quartz was explored and the same condition used on other substrates including glass, sapphire (C-plane, M-plane, R-plane), Si and SiO2/Si came to a same conclusion, which confirmed that the aligned growth of CuPc nano column is not substrate-dependent. And then the CuPc nano column with special morphology was integrated as in-situ sensor device which exhibits high sensitivity and selectivity towards Cl2at room temperature with a minimum detection limit as low as 0.08 ppm. The response of sensor was found to increase linearly (26∼659%) with the increase for Cl2within concentration range (0.08∼4.0ppm). These results clearly demonstrate the great potential of the nano column growth and device integration approach for sensor device. © 2016 Author(s).",Open Access,20163702808902,95303.0,"Zhao, Jianhong (1); Qiao, Zhenfang (1, 2); Zhang, Yumin (2); Zou, Taoyu (1, 2); Yu, Leiming (1); Luo, Li (1, 2); Wang, Xiaoyan (1); Yang, Yiji (1, 2); Wang, Hai (1); Tang, Libin (3) ","(1) Key Lab. of Yunnan Prov.

J. Adhes. Sci. Technol.,"To develop a soy-based adhesive with good water resistance, non-toxic melamine–glyoxal resin (MG) prepared in the laboratory was used as a cross-linker of soy-based adhesive. The FT-IR and ESI-MS results showed that there was a reaction between melamine and glyoxal. The resulted –CH–OH– groups could be the possible reactive groups for the cross-linking of soy-based adhesive. The wet shear strength of soy-based plywood indicated that the water resistance of soy adhesive cross-linked by MG improved with respect to that with no cross-linker, although it was not good enough to satisfy the relative standard. With the optimized preparation procedures for plywood, specifically, press temperature 180 °C, press time 3 min and resin loading 280 g m−2, type I soy-based plywood could be prepared with a hybrid cross-linker, namely 12%MG + 2% epoxy resin (EPR). The DSC results showed that the reaction between soy-based adhesive and the hybrid cross-linker MG + EPR was very complex. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,20161802317457,,"Wu, Zhigang (1, 2); Lei, Hong (1); Cao, Ming (1); Xi, Xuedong (1); Liang, Jiankun (1, 2); Du, Guanben (1, 2) ","(1) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Wood Adhesives and Glued Products, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming, China (2) Material Science and Technology College, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China ",JATEE8,"603.1 Machine Tools, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 811.2 Wood and Wood Products - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers",,,,,Crosslinking - Plywood - Presses (machine tools) - Wood products,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lei, Hong(honeyray2006@hotmail.com) ",10.1080/01694243.2016.1175247,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15685616,"Number: 201304505, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in the Public Welfare; Number: 2013FA038, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31170530, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by Yunnan Province Natural Science Foundation [grant number 2013FA038], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31170530] and Special Fund for Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Welfare [grant number 201304505].",,01694243,19,"October 1, 2016",English,Epoxy resins,,18.0,2120-2129,,2016,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology,,Soy-based adhesive cross-linked by melamine–glyoxal and epoxy resin,,Cross-linkers - Glyoxal - Non-toxic - Preparation procedures - Reactive group - Resin loading - Soy based adhesive - Water-resistances,30
Gaodianya Jishu,"Frequency domain dielectric spectroscopy (FDS), a diagnostic method to diagnose the insulationcondition of transformers,needs to scan the excitation frequency point-by-point in the general condition, which takes a long period in the low frequency. So it may not be appropriate in some time-limited conditions. To solve this issue, we put forward a testingmethod of FDS affected by hybridfrequency voltage.The proposed method imposes a composite hybrid-frequency signal to the dielectric as input stimulus.The current response information is decomposed into several sinusoidal waves which match the corresponding frequency, then the complex capacitance can be acquired through calculation. The oil clearance experimental results reveal that a contrast of the decomposition value of the hybrid frequency response and the value of single frequency response between the two methods shows the correctness of the proposed FDS. Meanwhile, this method is adopted to measure the dielectric spectrum ofoil-paper insulationand realtransformer and compared with the scanning frequency results of IDAX300. The results show that the proposed method almostcoincides withthe conventional FDS method in complex capacitance, while the proposed method can remarkably save time. © 2016, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Int. J. on Artif. Intell. Tools,"The potential applications and challenges of uncertain data mining have recently attracted interests from researchers. Most uncertain data mining algorithms consider aleatory (random) uncertainty of data, i.e. these algorithms require that exact probability distributions or confidence values are attached to uncertain data. However, knowledge about uncertainty may be incomplete in the case of epistemic (incomplete) uncertainty of data, i.e. probabilities of uncertain data may be imprecise, coarse, or missing in some applications. The paper focuses on uncertain data which miss probabilities, specially, value-uncertain discrete objects which miss probabilities (for short uncertain objects). On the other hand, classification is one of the most important tasks in data mining. But, to the best of our knowledge, there is no method to learn Naïve Bayesian classifier from uncertain objects. So the paper studies Naïve Bayesian classification of uncertain objects. Firstly, the paper defines interval probabilities of uncertain objects from probabilistic cardinality point of view, and bridges the gap between uncertain objects and the theory of interval probability by proving that interval probabilities are F-probabilities. Secondly, based on the theory of interval probability, the paper defines conditional interval probabilities including the intuitive concept and the canonical concept, and the conditional independence of the intuitive concept. Further, the paper gives a formula to effectively compute the intuitive concept. Thirdly, the paper presents a Naïve Bayesian classifier with interval probability parameters which can handle both uncertain objects and certain objects. Finally, experiments with uncertain objects based on UCI data show satisfactory performances. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,20162702560481,1650012.0,"Chen, Hongmei (1); Liu, Weiyi (1); Wang, Lizhen (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Data mining - Uncertainty analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1142/S0218213016500123,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17936349,"Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: XT412011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: 61262069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61262069, 61472346), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2015FB114, 2014FA023), and the Program for Innovative Research Team in Yunnan University (XT412011).",,02182130,3,"June 1, 2016",English,Probability distributions,,26.0,,,2016,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Int. J. Comput. Sci. Math.,"The state-of-the-art methods used for entity attribute relation extraction are primarily based on statistical machine learning, and the performance strongly depends on the quality of the extracted features. Deep belief networks (DBN) has been successful in the high dimensional feature space information extraction task, which can without complicated pre-processing. In this paper, the DBN, which consists of one or more restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) layers and a back-propagation (BP) layer, is presented to extract Chinese entity attribute relation in domain-specific. First, the word tokens are transformed to vectors by looking up word embeddings. Then, the RBM layers maintain as much information as possible when feature vectors are transferred to next layer. Finally, the BP layer is trained to classify the features generated by the last RBM layer, and adopting Levenberg-Marquard (LM) optimisation algorithm to do the training. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art learning models in specific domain entity attribute relation extraction. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",,20162202433221,,"Xian, Yantuan (1, 2); Shao, Fa (1); Guo, Jianyi (1, 2); Zhou, Lanjiang (1, 2); Yu, Zhengtao (1, 2); Chen, Wei (1, 2) ","(1) School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China (2) Key Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Intelligent Computing of Yunnan College, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,723.4 Artificial Intelligence,,,,,Backpropagation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Guo, Jianyi(gjade86@hotmail.com) ",10.1504/IJCSM.2016.076422,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17525063,"Number: 2013FA030, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61262041, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472168, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61562052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61262041, 61472168 and 61562052) and the key project of National Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan province (Grant No. 2013FA030).",,17525055,2,2016,English,Deep learning,,23.0,144-155,,2016,Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,International Journal of Computing Science and Mathematics,,Using deep belief networks to extract Chinese entity attribute relation in domain-specific,,Chinese entity attribute - combination features - Deep belief nets - LM algorithm - Relation extraction,7

Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"To solve the problem of operational cooperation faced by large-middle scale hydropower when numerous small hydropower who connecting the grids, a model for the optimal operation of the large-middle scale hydropower under the limitation of transmission capacity while transmitting via grids with small hydropower in given areas was proposed. The proposed method regards the maximum absorption of hydroelectricity as the optimal objective under the constraints of transmission capacity, and the model is based on the correlation analysis of the regional flow of large-middle scale hydropower and the load of small hydropower. Moreover, the index and the relative analysis method for the increasing absorption of hydroelectricity along with the improved transmission capacity were developed. The numerical results from Dehong, Yunnan illustrates the proposed method can effectively facilitate the absorption of hydroelectricity, which contributes to the benefits of cooperation among large-middle scale and small hydropower while perfectly considering the limitation of transmission capacity. Furthermore, the proposed index and analysis method can offer useful advices for the expansion of transmission capacity, which takes account of the characteristics of long-term generation ability of small hydropower. © 2016 Chin.

Chem. Eur. J.,"A germylene/borane Lewis pair (2) was prepared from a 1,1-carboboration of amidinato phenylethynylgermylene (1) by B(C6F5)3. Compound 2 reacted with iPrNCO and (4-MeOC6H4)C(O)Me, respectively, with cleavage of the C=O double bond. In the first instance, O and iPrNC insert separately into the Ge−B bond to yield a GeBC2O-heterocycle (3) and a GeBC3-heterocycle (4). In the second case (4-MeOC6H4)(Me)C inserts into the Ge−N bond of 2 while O is incorporated in the Ge−B bond to form a Ge-centered spiroheterocycle (5). The reaction of 2 with tBuNC to give 6, which has almost the same structure as 4, proved the formation of the isonitrile during transformation from 2 and iPrNCO to 3 and 4. The kinetic study of the reaction of 2 and iPrNCO gave evidence of proceeding through a GeBC3O-heterocycle intermediate.

React. Kinet. Mech. Catal.,"TiO2/phenyl group functionalized mesoporous silica photocatalysts (denoted as TiO2/Ph-MS) were synthesized via the sol–gel method. The prepared catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nitrogen adsorption/desorption and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The results indicated that the TiO2/Ph-MS photocatalyst was composed of the TiO2particle core (around 20–30 nm) and a shell layer of phenol group functionalized mesoporous silica with a thickness of about 2.5 nm, which contained as much as 63.0 wt% TiO2. The TiO2/Ph-MS composite was applied to remove BPA by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation. The results indicated that the introduced phenyl group was hydrophobic and has strong adsorption ability for BPA. The adsorption removal ratio of BPA over the TiO2/Ph-MS (8.4 %) was much higher than that over TiO2/MS (0.4 %), and the photocatalytic degradation removal ratios of BPA on TiO2/Ph-MS (20.24 %) was higher than that over TiO2/MS (14.36 %). The enhanced photocatalytic degradation removal rate of BPA over TiO2/Ph-MS could be attributed to increasing adsorption ability for BPA on the surface of TiO2/Ph-MS. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",,20163602779091,,"Luo, Li-Jun (1); Zhou, Qiang (1); Li, Han (2); Bian, Long-Chun (2); Jiang, Feng-Zhi (2); Pan, Xue-Jun (3); Wang, Min (2); Wang, Hong-Bin (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Resource Clean Conversion in Ethnic Regions of Yunnan Province, School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource, Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",,"741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 932.1 High Energy Physics",,,,,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Gas adsorption - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Hydrophobicity - Mesoporous materials - Phenols - Photocatalysis - Photocatalysts - Scanning electron microscopy - Silica - Sols - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction analysis - X rays,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Luo, Li-Jun(10501931@qq.com) ",10.1007/s11144-016-1075-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18785204,,,,18785190,2,"December 1, 2016",English,Titanium dioxide,,24.0,715-725,,2016,Springer Netherlands,"Reaction Kinetics, Mechanisms and Catalysis",,Removal of bisphenol A on hydrophobic TiO2/mesoporous silica core/shell photocatalyst,,Adsorption ability - Bis-phenol a - Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy - Mesoporous Silica - Nitrogen adsorption - Photo catalytic degradation - TiO2 - X ray fluorescence,119

Fluid Phase Equilib.,"In this work, interaction energies between pairs of atoms for the Ag-Pb, Cu-Pb and Sn-Pb systems have been calculated using ab initio methods. These energies are then used as the interaction energy parameters in the Wilson equation. Phase diagram of vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) for the Pb-based alloy systems in vacuum distillation are obtained based on the calculated parameters. The results indicate that this approach can lead to accurate VLE predictions for alloy systems in vacuum distillation based only on properties of pure components and the structure of the clusters.

Innovative Food Sci. Emerg. Technol.,"The objective of this study is to investigate effects of high pressure processing (HPP) on the organoleptic properties of pickled radish during refrigerated storage. Under the HPP treatment at 550 MPa/5 min, total plate count (TPC) decreased by 5.57 log10 CFU/mL, and yeasts and molds (Y&M) were totally inactivated. There is no significant difference in the microbiological index between HPP and thermal processing (TP) at 80 °C/20 min and both samples showed microbiologically safe during 60-day storage at 4 °C (TPC 10 CFU/mL). HPP showed significant impact on pH, hardness and color of pickled radish, whereas had less microstructural damage of pickled radish tissues. In comparison with TP-treated pickled radish the flavor of HPP-treated pickled radish was more preferable. Since HPP increased the abundance of linalool, citronellol and citral and reduced the abundance of sulfide and terpinolene, resulting in the increase of sweetness and the decrease of stimulating flavor. Industrial relevance This study was intended to develop better quality and more stable pickled radish without preservative, which is not available on the market now. There is little knowledge on the influence of HPP on the quality of pickles, such as color, texture and flavor. In this study, HPP showed significant impact on pH, hardness and color of pickled radish, whereas had less microstructural damage of pickled radish tissues. HPP treatment could be applied for the inactivation of microorganism, and they were microbiologically safe (TPC 10 CFU/mL, Y&M were not detected) during 90-day storage at 4 °C. In comparison with TP-treated pickled radish the flavor of HPP-treated pickled radish was more preferable.

"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Information System and Artificial Intelligence, ISAI 2016","In this paper, a method is put forward to implement the automatic syllable segmentation of continuous Pumi speech with GABPNN, based on the two features of DWPTMFCC and fractal dimension. Concretely, speech signal is at first denoised by wavelet packet transform. Afterwards, for speech and non-speech frames, fractal dimension of each frame is extracted and labeled respectively. The same is also done for DWPTMFCC by wavelet packet transform. As a feature vector, a 17 dimensional vector from 17 DWPTMFCCs, together with fractal dimension is used to train and test GABPNN. Finally, according to DWPTMFCC, the automatic syllable segmentation of continuous Pumi speech is implemented, combining with dynamic threshold of fractal dimension. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the auto segmentation arrives at 95.16%, and that our method is effective, and better than conventional ones with regard to continuous Pumi speech. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171403533603,7816743.0,"Fu, Mei-Jun (1); Pan, Wen-Lin (1); Hu, Wen-Jun (1); Chen, Shao-Xiong (1) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 751.5 Speech - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 921 Mathematics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations,125875.0,"June 24, 2016 - June 26, 2016","Hong Kong, China","2016 International Conference on Information System and Artificial Intelligence, ISAI 2016",Artificial intelligence - Information systems - Information use - Speech - Wavelet analysis - Wavelet transforms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ISAI.2016.0090,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509015856.0,,,"January 12, 2017",English,Fractal dimension,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Information System and Artificial Intelligence, ISAI 2016",8.0,395-400,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Information System and Artificial Intelligence, ISAI 2016",,Syllable segmentation of pumi speech with GABPNN based on fractal dimension and DWPTMFCC,,Auto segmentation - Dimensional vectors - DWPTMFCC - Dynamic threshold - Feature vectors - GABPNN - Syllable segmentation - Wavelet packet transforms,
Front. Artif. Intell. Appl.,Hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) is one of the most common used techniques for expressing the decision maker's subjective evaluation information. Interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set (IVHFS) is the extension of HFS and can reflect our intuition more objectively. In this paper we focus on the IVHF information aggregation methods based on Bonferroni mean (BM). We proposed the IVHF geometric BM operator (IVHFGBM) and weighted IVHFGBM operators. Some numerical examples for the operators are designed for showing their effectiveness. The desirable properties of weighted IVHFGBM operator are also discussed in detail. These operators can be applied in many areas especially in decision making problems. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

Neurocomputing,"Visual tracking has been a popular and attractive topic in computer vision for a long time. In recent decades, many challenge problems in object tracking has been effectively resolved by using learning based tracking strategies. Number of investigations carried on learning theory found that when labeled samples are limited, the learning performance can be sufficiently improved by exploiting unlabeled ones. Therefore, one of the most important issue for semi-supervised learning is how to assign the labels to the unlabeled samples, which is also the principal focus of transductive learning. Unfortunately, considering the efficiency requirement of online tracking, the optimization scheme employed by the traditional transductive learning is hard to be applied to online tracking problems because of its large computational cost during sample labeling. In this paper, we proposed an efficient transductive learning for online tracking by utilizing the correspondences among the generated unlabeled and labeled samples.

Energy,"An energy management system for stand-alone microgrid composed of diesel generators, wind turbine generator, biomass generator and an ESS (energy storage system) is proposed in this paper. Different operation objectives are achieved by a hierarchical control structure with different time scales. Firstly, the optimal schedules of the diesel generators, wind turbine generator, biomass generator and ESS are determined fifteen minutes ahead according to the super short-term forecast of load and wind speed in the optimal scheduling layer. Comprehensive analysis which takes the uncertainty of load and wind speed into account is conducted in this layer to minimize the operation cost of the system and ensure a desirable range of the state of charge of the ESS. Secondly, the operation points of each unit are regulated dynamically to guarantee real-time power balance and safety range of diesel generation in the real-time control layer, based on which the response capability when suffering significant forecast deviation and other emergency issues, e.g. sudden load-up can be improved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy is verified on an RT_Lab based real-time simulation platform, and the economic performances with different types of ESS are analyzed as well. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,20160801986405,,"Wang, Chengshan (1); Liu, Yixin (1); Li, Xialin (1); Guo, Li (1); Qiao, Lei (1, 2); Lu, Hai (3) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Smart Grid of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin; 300072, China (2) Tianjin Chengjian University, Tianjin; 300072, China (3) Electric Power Research Institute, Yunnan Power Grid Company Limited, Yunnan; 650000, China ",ENEYDS,"443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 525 Energy Management and Conversion - 525.7 Energy Storage - 615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 705.2 Electric Generators - 706 Electric Transmission and Distribution - 723.3 Database Systems - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,Biomass - Energy management - Energy storage - Real time control - Storage management - Turbogenerators - Uncertainty analysis - Wind - Wind turbines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Xialin(xialinlee@tju.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.099,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 13TXSYJC40400, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Tianjin Science and Technology Committee; Number: 2015AA050104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",This work was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) ( 2015AA050104 ).

Appl Surf Sci,"A simple and low cost MACE method was demonstrated for efficiently texturing commercial mc-Si wafer at room temperature. The effects of fabrication parameters (deposition time, HF concentration, H2O2 concentration, and etching time) on the morphology structure, antireflection property of textured mc-Si were carefully studied. The large scale SiNWs arrays with different structure can be obtained under various fabrication conditions. Meanwhile, the results indicate that the fabricate parameters have important effect on the reflectance of textured mc-Si sample in the order of etching time > deposition time > H2O2 concentration > HF concentration. The comprehensive research results indicate that it is more beneficial for the nanowire arrays with tapering structure and the length of 13 μm to obtain excellent antireflection property. Under these optimization conditions, the textured mc-Si shows an outstanding anti-reflectance ability of ∼5.6%, which indicates that the Ag-catalysis etched mc-Si shows a huge potential application in high-efficiency polysilicon solar cells. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Sep. Purif. Technol.,"Surfactant-enhanced remediation is a powerful technology for soil clean-up. However, some drawbacks, such as its high cost and the secondary contamination caused by flushing agents, have hampered this technology and its commercial application has been largely limited to North American and European countries. The aim of this work is to introduce a novel reversible solubilization system composed of the photoresponsive surfactant 4-butylazobenzene-4′-(oxyethyl)trimethylammonium bromide (AZTMA) and the commercial non-ionic surfactant Tween80 for the solubilization of organic contaminants. The solubilization behavior of the AZTMA/Tween80 surfactant system toward polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been studied. Critical micelle concentration (CMC) values indicate that the mixed system has a synergism in mixed micelle formation, and that the interaction parameter (β) is -2.85 when the mole ratio is 2:8. AZTMA is also predicted to be low biologic toxicity by the CMC and surface tension. The synergistic effect on molar solubilization ratio (MSR) and micelle-phase/aqueous-phase partition coefficient Kmcvalues is related to the composition and concentration of the mixed system and follows the order pyrene > phenanthrene > acenaphthene, and these parameters are much higher than those for the single surfactants. After irradiation with UV light, more than 65% of the PAHs could be separated from the mixed micelles, and the cumulative release efficiencies of selected PAHs are consistent with the results of solubilization experiments. All of these features demonstrate that mixed AZTMA/Tween80 should be preferable to single surfactants for soil remediation, avoiding the issues associated with chemical flushing agents and decreasing remediation costs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"The Processing of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is the key to clinical application of TCM, and processing has functions such as enhancing the efficacy, attenuating the toxicity andmoderating medicine property. In order to the realizing safe, reasonable and effective use of medicine in clinical, research on identification of TCM processed products is of great significance. The Gentiana rigescens samples which processed with five different methods were discriminated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Baseline correction and normalization were used to pretreat all original spectra and the noise was cut off. The spectra range was from 3 400 to 600 cm-1. The effect of multiple scattering correction and standard normal variable on the model were observed and compared. Samples were divided into calibration set and prediction set at the ratio of 3:1. The principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce data dimensionality and discriminant analysis model was established. The result indicated that the main absorption peaks of samples were 3 378, 2 922, 1 732, 1 610, 1 417, 1 366, 1 316, 1 271, 1 068, 1 048 cm-1which 1 738, 1 643, 1 613, 1 420, 1 051 cm-1as to gentiopicrin; 1 068, 1 048, 935 cm-1as to carbohydrate. The accumulation contribution rate of first three principal components is 94.05%. Most of the information reflected the original data. There were differences among different samples. The result of discriminant analysis showed that the recognition rate of G. rigescens samples could achieve to 100% based on baseline correction and normalization treatment combined with MSC with the precondition of principal component scores being 10. In conclusion, FTIR is a feasible, rapid and non-destructive method to discriminate G. rigescens samples wtih different processing methods.

Biotechnol. Biotechnol. Equip.,"Panax notoginseng has been used for medicinal purposes in China for many years. Saponins are believed to be the major bioactive ingredients in P. notoginseng. Two different processes, steaming and biotransformation, were used to study the transformations of saponins in P. notoginseng. During an 8-h steaming process, the ginsenosides Rb1, Rd, Rg1, Re and notoginsenoside R1, decreased to 1.07 mg/g dry weight (DW), 0.91, 0.64, 0 and 0 mg/g DW, respectively. Meanwhile, ginsenoside 20(S)-Rg3, 20(S)-Rh1, F2 and compound K significantly increased to 5.85, 6.10, 0.81 and 6.62 mg/g DW, respectively. On the other hand, one fungus was isolated from the root of P. notoginseng, which could transform ginsenoside Rb1 to ginsenoside Rd specifically. The fungus was identified as Trichoderma longibrachiatum species based on sequence analysis of the rRNA internal transcribed spacers region. The results implied a prospective feasibility for setting up different processing techniques to improve the quality of P. notoginseng and add its value. © 2015 The Author(s).

Signal Process,"Visual tracking is a key technique used by video abstraction to achieve efficient post-analysis for big video surveillance. In order to tackle the problem of constantly changing scenarios during online tracking, additional factors such as motion can be incorporated by utilizing a fusion strategy to improve the final performance. Unfortunately, straightforward output fusion is difficult to be synchronized due to the diversity in model regression. Therefore, a widely cited problem for learning based fusion is to incorporate regularizers for label assignment of unlabeled samples, which is one of the major research focuses on semi-supervised learning. In this paper, a novel tracking strategy based on semi-supervised learning with high order regularization fusion has been proposed. It employs two different types of regularizers to achieve more accurate label assignment based on kernelized confidence prediction and graph-based bi-directional trace from motion. The computation of the proposed tracker takes advantage of the unique feature of circulant matrix in Fourier domain and integral patterns, and thus can be readily implemented for real-time processing, even without any code optimization. Via a dynamic budget maintenance for model updating, the proposed tracking method demonstrated to outperform most state-of-art trackers on challenging benchmark videos with a fixed parameter configuration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Chin. J. Catal.,"This study focuses on drawing a hydrothermal synthesis process map for Co3O4nanoparticles with various morphologies and investigating the effects of Co3O4nanocatalyst morphology on CO oxidation. A series of cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate nanoparticles with various morphologies (i.e., nanorods, nanosheets, and nanocubes) were successfully synthesized, and Co3O4nanoparticles were obtained by thermal decomposition of the cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate precursors. The results suggest that the cobalt source is a key factor for controlling the morphology of cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate at relatively low hydrothermal temperatures (≤ 140 °C). Nanorods can be synthesized in CoCl2solution, while Co(NO3)2solution promotes the formation of nanosheets. Further increasing the synthesis temperature (higher than 140 °C) results in the formation of nanocubes in either Co(NO3)2or CoCl2solution. The reaction time only affects the size of the obtained nanoparticles. The presence of CTAB could improve the uniformity and dispersion of particles. Co3O4nanosheets showed much higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation than nanorods and nanocubes because it has more abundant Co3+on the surface, much higher reducibility, and better oxygen desorption capacity. © 2016 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,20162502508498,,"Zeng, Liangpeng (1, 2); Li, Kongzhai (1, 2); Huang, Fan (1, 2); Zhu, Xing (1, 2); Li, Hongcheng (1, 2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgy and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",CJCHCI,504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Carbon monoxide - Carbonation - Catalyst activity - Catalytic oxidation - Chlorine compounds - Cobalt deposits - Decomposition - Hydrothermal synthesis - Morphology - Nanocatalysts - Nanoparticles - Nanorods - Nanosheets - Oxidation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Kongzhai(kongzhai.li@aliyun.com) ",10.1016/S1872-2067(16)62460-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51204083, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51374004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51374004, 51204083), the Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province (2012HB009, 2014HB006), the Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province (2014FB123), a School-Enterprise Cooperation Project from Jinchuan Corporation (Jinchuan 201115), and the Talents Training Program of Kunming University of Science and Technology (KKZ3201352038)",,18722067,6,"June 1, 2016",English,Cobalt compounds,,61.0,908-922,,2016,Science Press,Chinese Journal of Catalysis,,Effects of Co3O4nanocatalyst morphology on CO oxidation: Synthesis process map and catalytic activity,,Carbon monoxide oxidation - Carbonate precursor - Cobalt hydroxides - Hydrothermal temperature - Morphology effect - Nano-catalyst - Synthesis process - Synthesis temperatures,37

This alloy is known as azeotropic compounds within a certain ingredients at different temperature. The separation of Pb-Sb alloys is experimental carried out by vacuum distillation at 1173 K. Our predictions are coincident with the available experimental data. The experiment results indicate that there exists common volatilization for Pb-Sb alloys when Sb content is 15-20 wt.%. In addition, the calculation results show that when the content of Sb is around 15 wt.%, there is an intense interaction between Pb and Sb, which supports the experimental results.

J. Iron Steel Res. Int.,"A hot compression experiment (1073–1473 K, strain rates of 0.001–10s−1) of SA508GR. 4N low alloy steel was performed using a Gleeble-3800 thermal-mechanical simulator, and the hot deformation behavior of the steel was investigated by analyzing both the true stress-true strain curves and its microstructures. The thermal deformation equation and hot deformation activation energy (Q) of SA508GR. 4N steel were obtained by regression with a classic hyperbolic sine function. The hot processing map of SA508GR. 4N steel was also established. An empirical equation for the stress peak was described for practical applications. The SA508GR. 4N steel showed a critical Zener-Hollomon parameter (lnZc) for dynamic recrystallization (DRX) of 37.44, below which full DRX may occur. The sensitivity of the SA508GR.4N steel increased linearly with test temperature, such that higher temperatures led to enhanced workability. © 2016 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute",,20165103152794,,"LIU, Ning (1, 2); LIU, Zheng-dong (1, 2); HE, Xi-kou (2); YANG, Zhi-qiang (2); MA, Long-teng (2) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Institute for Special Steels, Central Iron and Steel Research Institute, Beijing; 100081, China ",,531.1 Metallurgy - 535.2 Metal Forming - 619.2 Tanks - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Activation energy - Deformation - Dynamic recrystallization - Hot working - Hyperbolic functions - Nuclear reactors - Pressure vessels - Strain rate,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","LIU, Zheng-dong(liu_zhengdong@263.net) ",10.1016/S1006-706X(16)30197-2,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22103988,,,,1006706X,12,"December 1, 2016",English,Alloy steel,,17.0,1342-1348,,2016,Gangtie Yanjiu Xuebao,Journal of Iron and Steel Research International,,Hot Deformation Behavior of SA508GR. 4N Steel for Nuclear Reactor Pressure Vessels,,Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) - Hot deformation activation energies - Hot deformation equations - Hot processing - Nuclear reactor pressure vessels - Thermal deformation equations - True stress - true strain curves - Zener-Hollomon parameter,23

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Governments want to establish a financial safety net (FSN) to prevent financial crises from spreading. The FSN is a series of institutional arrangements to preserve financial stability. In the real FSN, it includes the central bank, deposit insurance institutions and their premium, commercial banks and their benefit rates, etc., and these parameters are interdependent and dynamic change. And thus, analysis and computing of the FSN is very challenging. Inspired by evolutionary game theory, in this paper, we first establish a network game model of the FSN to analyze the evolution of bank deposit insurance strategies, and further propose a method to measure the effectiveness of the FSN. Finally, we use computational experiments to simulate the operation of the FSN. In the experiments, an evolutionary computation method is employed to compute banks’ decisions to reduce computing time. Experimental results show that our evolutionary approach is suitable for the FSN, and is able to provide suggestions of macro policy for regulators. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,20165203193133,,"Yang, Ke (1, 2); Yue, Kun (1); Wu, Hong (1, 3); Li, Jin (1); Liu, Weiyi (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Head Office, Fudian Bank, Kunming, China (3) School of Information Engineering, Qujing Normal University, Qujing, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 922.1 Probability Theory",187509.0,"December 7, 2016 - December 9, 2016","Chiang Mai, Thailand","10th Multi-Disciplinary International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence, MIWAI 2016",Artificial intelligence - Deposits - Evolutionary algorithms - Finance - Game theory,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Ke(19732978@qq.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-49397-8_22,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016ZZX013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014C134Y, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61562091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.61562091), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2014FA023), and the Research Foundation of the Education Department of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2014C134Y, 2016ZZX013).",9783319493961.0,03029743,,2016,English,Computation theory,"Multi-disciplinary Trends in Artificial Intelligence - 10th International Workshop, MIWAI 2016, Proceedings",22.0,255-267,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Evolutionary analysis and computing of the financial safety net,,Computational experiment - Evolutionary approach - Evolutionary game theory - Evolutionary games - Financial stability - Institutional arrangement - Safety nets - Simulation,10053 LNAI
Zhongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban),"The reaction thermodynamic of Ag and Sn or Zn, the mass fraction of Ag in the dross, and the composition, microstructure and distribution of Ag-Zn intermetallic compound (IMC) were studied by using scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and chemical composition analysis when Zn was added into the Sn-36.6%Pb-1%Ag (mass fraction) system. The results show that the formation of Ag-Zn IMC is easier than that of Ag-Sn IMC. The content of Ag in the dross is less than 1%. There are three phase regions, which are rich Sn region (Sn-12.21%Pb-0.52%Ag-2.42%Zn), rich Pb region (Pb-31.34%Sn-1.89%Zn) and Ag-Zn IMC region (Zn-27.30%Ag- 10.87%Sn-3.7%Pb). The three phase regions are distributed in the top, middle and bottom of the system, and they are not layered. No segregation of Ag-Zn IMC region can be seen in the system. The reasons for these phenomena can be attributed to the fact that the density of Sn-36.6%Pb-1%Ag is only 0.35 g/cm3larger than that of Ag-Zn IMC, and that Sn-36.6%Pb-1%Ag is rich tin-based system in which dual-phase stratified region could not exist. Nevertheless, when the Pb was added into the Sn-Pb-Ag system, the density of system increased, and dual-phase stratified region occurred in liquid phase when the mass fraction of Pb was more than 60%, which made it possible to enrich Ag by adding Zn into the Sn-Pb-Ag alloy. © 2016, Central South University of Technology.

Cailiao Daobao/Mater. Rev.,"This paper briefly introduces the physical and chemical properties and application of diamond films. The merits and demerits of different chemical vapor deposition methods which are applied to diamond film production are discussed, and technology bottleneck of MPCVD is presented. The influences on nucleation process of diamond films, specifically, reaction chamber pressure, substrate temperature, substrate material and enhanced nucleation technique, are summarized. It suggests that low reaction chamber pressure and substrate temperature, high carbon source concentration and plasma pretreatment would greatly benefit the nucleation density.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"Wild relatives play a very important role in enriching germplasm resources and improving the quality and yield of cultivated species. In this paper, the genetic relationship between Panax notoginseng and its wild relatives has been investigated by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in order to provide theoretical bases in the variety improvement of P. notoginseng as well as the development and utilization of germplasm resources. The FTIR spectra of P. notoginseng and its wild relatives (P. japonicus var. major, P. stipuleanatus, P. vietnamensis, P. japonicus var. bipinnatifidus) as well as Panax notoginsenosides were collected. The original infrared spectra of P. notoginseng and its wild relatives were pretreated by automatic baseline correction, smoothing, ordinate normalization and second derivative. The genetic relationship between P. notoginseng and its wild relatives has been studied together with the aid of principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). By comparing the infrared spectra of P. notoginseng with that of panax notoginsenosides, some common peaks such as 3 400, 2 930, 1 635, 1 385, 1 075 and 927 cm-1has been found. It showed that the peak heights of P. notoginseng samples may relate with the content of panax notoginsenosides. The original infrared spectra of P. notoginseng are similar to its wild relatives and the absorption peaks of the functional groups of C-H, C=O, O-H, C-N and C-O were presented. There were some differences in the fingerprint region (1 800~500 cm-1) of the second derivative spectra of these five species samples. The characteristic absorption peaks such as 1 385 and 784 cm-1has an obviously differentiation. Then the fingerprint region of second derivative spectra is subjected to be analyzed by PCA and PLS-DA. By comparing the 3D score plots of these two methods, the classification result of PLS-DA is significantly better than PCA. In addition, the result of HCA which based on the six principal components of PLS-DA has shown that P. japonicus var. major and P. vienamensis have close relationship with P. notoginseng while P. stipuleanatus and P. japonicus var. bipinnatifidus are far from P. notoginseng. The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometrics methods could effectively investigate the genetic relationship between P. notoginseng and its wild relatives. Furthermore, it could provide reference for the research of medicinal plants. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao,"A bulky mining-out area was formed at Dahongshan iron mine with sublevel caving method. The thickness of overburden is 627 to 750 meter. In order to understand the development of collapse area, fractured zone and high stress concentration zone in overburden so as to prevent the sudden large-scale and dynamic ground pressure disasters, micro-seismic monitoring, tunnel observation and borehole detection methods were used to carry out the comprehensive monitoring and research. Base on the precise location of fracture source with multi-channel micro-seismic monitoring technology, high-stress concentration zone and its developing trend were determined, and then the outer boundary was deduced. At same time, the analysis on fracture types of fracture source with double couples model showed that the tension fracture with volume-increasing accounted for majority of all sources, while the shear failure and mixed failure accounted for minority. The boundary of collapse area, external and internal boundaries of fractured area were determined directly through the artificial observation in special tunnels. The borehole detection as the auxiliary method was used to determine and validate the external boundary of fractured zone. A comprehensive monitoring and analysis were carried out to obtain the caving zone, cracking zone and high stress concentration area in overburden in different periods from 2011 to 2013. The development of high stress zone, cracking zone and caving zone in different periods were also obtained. The studies showed that the caving and cracking processes in overburden were slow and gradual. The sudden and dynamic large-scale collapse disaster would not occur. The conclusion of this paper played an important role in guiding the safe production of the mine. © 2016, Science Press.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Power Syst. Technol., POWERCON","Rapid growth of air conditioning (AC) has caused large effect on safe and economical operation of power grid especially in summer. The research on the AC load monitoring is of great significance for improving the stability of power grid. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is gaining attention due to many attractive features, such as low cost, low-complexity and easy promotion. A NILM of AC model using low sampling rate smart meter data is proposed in this paper. Firstly, preliminary recognition is performed to detect all possible events. Secondly, several features describing the distinct difference between AC and other appliances are extracted. Support Vector Classification (SVM) model for further detection is built with the extracted features. Finally, simulations on real-world data with low sampling rate from 5 houses are carried out to verify the effectiveness of our model.

Greenh. Gases Sci. Technol.,"N2O, CO2, and CH4are important greenhouse gases (GHGs) in paddy fields, and rice plants play an important role in GHG emissions in paddy fields. However, the relationship between light and rice plant GHG emissions is unclear. In this study, we monitored N2O, CO2, and CH4emissions of mature aging rice under different light qualities and intensities. The results showed that (i) under natural sunlight, the rice phyllosphere N2O emission rate was 22.94 μg pot–1h–1, accounting for 60% of the whole rice plant total N2O-N evaporation loss. The CO2emission rates from the phyllosphere and the root system were 27.82 mg pot–1h–1and 8.02 mg pot–1h–1, respectively. However, no CH4net emission effects were observed. (ii) Under a constant LED monocolor light intensity (1600 Lux), red, blue, and white light can inhibit N2O and CO2emissions from the rice phyllosphere, resulting in lower emissions than yellow light. White light can also inhibit N2O and CO2emissions from rice roots. (iii) Within the range of 06000 Lux, increases in light intensity can reduce rice phyllosphere CO2emissions, but such increases also promote N2O emissions from the rice phyllosphere and the roots. In contrast, natural sunlight can promote rice phyllosphere N2O and CO2emissions and can inhibit root N2O emissions. The measure of light control may be the key to low-carbon technology for GHG emission reductions in mature paddy ecosystems. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,20162602534460,,"Xu, Shengguang (1); Li, Bing (2); Xia, Yujie (2); Yu, Lei (3); Lin, Li (3); Chen, Zebin (3); Li, Yuwu (4) ","(1) Kunming University, Yunnan, China (2) Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yunnan, China (3) Kunming University, Yunnan, China (4) Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yunnan, China ",,"451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 451.2 Air Pollution Control - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 805 Chemical Engineering, General - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control",,,,,Carbon dioxide - Chemical industry - Emission control - Particulate emissions - Quality control,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Yuwu(lyw@xtbg.org.cn) ",10.1002/ghg.1565,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),21523878,,,,,3,"June 1, 2016",English,Greenhouse gases,,28.0,308-318,,2016,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology,,Controlling light quality and intensity can reduce N2O and CO2emissions of mature aging rice,,GHG emission - Light intensity - Light quality - Liquid culture - Paddy fields,6

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"In recirculating aquaculture system(RAS), the metabolites and residual feed of fish are the main sources of ammonia nitrogen. The biological filter is widely used to avoid the accumulation of ammonia nitrogen. Autotrophic nitrification plays an important role in biological filter. However, the proliferation period of autotrophic nitrification is relatively long, and susceptible to temperature; once the system fails to run, it takes a long time for nitrifying bacterial colony to recovery. In recent years, electrochemical oxidation technology has been applied to remove ammonia nitrogen. In this paper, the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen under different flow velocities, temperatures and current densities were investigated. The artificial wastewater with added ammonia nitrogen was used in this study. The salinity of wastewater was 30‰, and the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen was 10 mg/L. The micro-current electrolysis system was placed in a climatic cabinet to obtain a desirable temperature. The prepared wastewater of 2 L was poured into a beaker and heated by a constant temperature magnetic stirrer. The wastewater was circulated between electrolysis cell and beaker using a peristaltic pump, and then the power supply was enabled 10 min later. Various values of flow velocity(100, 300 and 500 mL/min), temperature (18, 25 and 32) and current density(20, 40 and 60 A/m2) were used in the experiments, and the ammonia nitrogen concentration was measured every 15 min. Moreover, the optimal electrolytic condition was established by the orthogonal analysis. The energy consumption of removing ammonia nitrogen was also calculated. The results showed that the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen after 90 min with different flow velocity of 100, 300 and 500 mL/min reached 92.38%, 95.15% and 93.27% respectively under the condition of 25 and 40 A/m2. Single factor analysis showed that the flow velocity had no significant effect on the removal rate. When the current density was 40 A/m2, the flow velocity was 300 mL/min, the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen reached 87.45%, 88.78% and 92.25% respectively after 60 min with different temperature of 18, 25 and 32. Single factor analysis showed that the temperature had no significant effect on the removal rate. When the temperature was 25, the flow velocity was 300 mL/min, the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen reached 59.32%, 87.89% and 89.01% respectively after 60 min with different current density of 20, 40 and 60 A/m2. Single factor analysis showed that the current density had significant effect on the removal rate, and the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen increased with the current density. The orthogonal analysis showed that the current density was the main influence factor of ammonia removal rate, and the optimum conditions were the current density of 40 A/m2and the flow rate of 300 mL/min, which resulted in the lowest energy consumption of 21.26 Wh/kg. Therefore, the micro-current electrolysis technology has good effect on the removal of ammonia nitrogen, the removal efficiency is relatively higher, and the energy consumption is relatively lower. The micro-current electrolysis technology has a great potential for application compared with the traditional biological filter. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

J. Phys. Chem. C,"The UV-visible absorption spectra of two-dimensional (2D) assemblies of Ag or Au nanocrystals (NCs) are measured in transmission at variable incidence angles for different average NC diameters ranging from 7.0 to 3.9 nm. The absorption spectra dominated by the collective surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band are compared to those calculated using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method. The anisotropy of the optical response is inherent to the planar geometry of the NC assembly because of the near-field coupling between nanocrystals. For Ag NCs, the absorption spectra reveal the splitting of the SPR band into two components, namely, the transverse and longitudinal modes. At variance, no SPR band splitting is observed for 2D assemblies of Au NCs with identical size and coating agent. These features were satisfactorily reproduced by DDA simulation even though the SPR mode energies deduced from our calculations slightly overestimate the measured ones. The influence of the coating dodecanethiol molecules on the electron refractive index inside the nanocrystals as well as that of the substrate could explain the mismatch between the measured and calculated spectra. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,20162802572523,,"Wei, J.J.

This study presents a novel object-based remote sensing image texture extraction method to aid the classification of mountain economic forest. Whereas the texture pattern of man-planted forest on mountainous area are similar with human fingerprint on remote sensing images, then we integrated the fingerprint recognition method with the image object-based GLCM (gray-level co-occurrence matrix) texture extraction method to classify economic forest plantation. The given method firstly enhances the texture feature of segmented image objects using a 2D Gabor filter; and then carries out an image binaryzation process to the filtered image objects; it lastly uses GLCM to calculate the texture characteristics of each image object.

Mob. Inf. Sys.,"On-demand broadcast is an effective data dissemination technique to enhance the system ability to handle dynamic client access patterns. With the development of real-time wireless applications, it is practical for clients to request multiple related data items with time constraint in one request. For real-time data broadcast, items are only useful if they can be received by clients before expiration; otherwise, the related requests become invalid. Hence, minimizing the number of requests that miss their deadlines becomes an important task in on-demand broadcast, especially for multi-item scenario, where more requests are inclined to miss their deadlines due to the heavier workload and greater complexity, compared with single-item scenario. In this paper, we propose a network coding-based scheduling algorithm for real-time multi-item data dissemination. The proposed algorithm exploits the coding opportunities between cached and requested data items and integrates network coding with data scheduling to minimize the deadline miss ratio. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the lowest deadline miss ratio under various circumstances. In addition, the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm in utilizing the transmission bandwidth is proved for that fewer instances of ineffective service are provided for satisfying clients' requests within time constraints. © 2016 Shujuan Wang et al.",Open Access,20170203241843,4320781.0,"Wang, Shujuan (1); Yan, Chunting (1); Yu, Zhengtao (1) ","(1) School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650500, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.2 Information Dissemination - 912.2 Management,,,,,Codes (symbols) - Information dissemination - Scheduling - Scheduling algorithms - Wireless telecommunication systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shujuan(shujuanwang0703@126.com) ",10.1155/2016/4320781,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1875905X,"Number: 2014Z022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: KKSY201403024, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 61561029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 61561029) and funded by the Major Project of Education Department of Yunnan Province (Grant no. 2014Z022) and the Talent Development Project of Kunming University of Science and Technology (Grant no.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Unlike previous Mongolian morphological segmentation methods based on large labeled training data or complicated rules concluded by linguists, we explore a novel semi-supervised method for a practical application, i.e., statistical machine translation (SMT), based on a low-resource learning setting, in which a small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data are available. First, a CRF-based supervised learning is exploited to predict morpheme boundaries by using small labeled data. Then, a lexicon-based segmentation model with small labeled data as the heuristic information is used to compensate the weakness in the first step by the abundant unlabeled data. Finally, we present some error correction models to revise segmentation results. Experimental results show that our method can improve the segmentation results compared with the pure supervised learning. Besides, we integrate the morphological segmentation result into Chinese-Mongolian SMT and achieve the satisfactory performance compared with the baseline. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,20164402968107,,"Yang, Zhenxin (1, 2); Li, Miao (1); Chen, Lei (1); Zeng, Weihui (1); Gao, Yi (3); Fu, Sha (3) ","(1) Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei; 230031, China (2) University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; 230026, China (3) Yunnan Agricultural Expert System Leading Group Office, Kunming; 650000, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications - 751.5 Speech",185279.0,"October 15, 2016 - October 16, 2016","Yantai, China","15th China National Conference on Chinese Computational Linguistics, CCL 2016 and 4th International Symposium on Natural Language Processing Based on Naturally Annotated Big Data, NLP-NABD 2016",Computational linguistics - Computer aided language translation - Error correction - Learning algorithms - Natural language processing systems - Speech transmission - Supervised learning,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Miao(mli@iim.ac.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-47674-2_13,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 2014BAD10B03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61502445, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61572462, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under No. 61572462, No. 61502445, the National Key Technology R&D Program under No. 2014BAD10B03.",9783319476735.0,03029743,,2016,English,Big data,"Chinese Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing Based on Naturally Annotated Big Data - 15th China National Conference, CCL 2016 and 4th International Symposium, NLP-NABD 2016, Proceedings",19.0,143-152,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Baidu; GRIDSUM; Iflytek; shujutang,Semi-supervised learning for Mongolian morphological segmentation,,Error correction models - Heuristic information - Labeled training data - Low resource languages - Morphological segmentation - Semi- supervised learning - Semi-supervised method - Statistical machine translation,10035 LNAI
Dianzi Yu Xinxi Xuebao,"In a passive Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) system, when multiple tags choose a same time slot to send information to a reader, tag collision will occur. Generally, the collision is resolved only on a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. In fact, the collision could be separated on a physical layer, and the efficiency of system identification could be advanced. In the physical layer separation, channel estimation is one of key techniques because good estimation could help to correctly recover the collided signals. Conventional channel estimates work well under the environment of two collided tags. When the number of collided tags is beyond two, however, the conventional channel estimates have more estimation errors. In this paper, a novel channel estimate method is proposed for the passive UHF RFID signal separation on physical layer. The proposed method uses the information of preambles which is a-priori known for a reader and applies a Least-Square (LS) criterion to estimate the channel parameters. From numerical results, the estimation errors of the proposed method are lower than the conventional methods under the number of collided tags is more than two. And, the separation efficiency of the proposed methods is also higher. © 2016, Science Press.

"Dry., Roasting, and Calcining of Minerals","The effect of moisture content on the dielectric properties and microwave drying behavior of zirconium hydroxide was studied by using an open-ended sensor dielectric measurement system at the frequency of 2.45 GHz. The experimental results showed that moisture content can significantly influence the variation of dielectric properties. Dielectric constant, loss factor and loss tangent all increase with the increasing moisture content. Compared with the conventional drying method, the microwave-assisted drying method resulted in a substantial decrease (81.8%) in the drying time, and the drying effect was better at the lower power level of 600 W. This study offers the useful information on dielectric properties of zirconium hydroxide, which can be used for developing microwave drying applications in mineral processing and designing better microwave sensors for measuring zirconium hydroxide moisture content. © 2016 by The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",,20174404350450,,"Ma, Aiyuan (1, 2, 3, 4); Zheng, Xuemei (1, 2, 3, 4); Zhang, Libo (1, 2, 3, 4); Peng, Jinhui (1, 2, 3, 4); Li, Shiwei (1, 2, 3, 4); Zuo, Yonggang (1, 2, 3, 4) ","(1) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming; 650093, China (2) National Local Joint Laboratory of Engineering Application of Microwave Energy and Equipment Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming; 650093, China (4) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",,"711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 732.2 Control Instrumentation - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 944.2 Moisture Measurements",,,,,Dielectric properties - Microwave heating - Microwave sensors - Microwaves - Moisture - Moisture determination - Zirconium compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Libo(lbzhang@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-48245-3_12,Engineering Village,Compendex,Book chapter (CH),,,,9781119073376.0,,,"January 1, 2016",English,Drying,,14.0,97-104,,2016,Springer International Publishing,"Drying, Roasting, and Calcining of Minerals",,Moisture dependent dielectric properties and microwave drying behavior of zirconium hydroxide,,Conventional drying - Dielectric measurements - Drying effects - Microwave drying - Microwave-assisted drying - Mineral processing - Power levels - Zirconium hydroxide,

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"l-tert-Leucine and its derivatives are used as synthetic building blocks for pharmaceutical active ingredients, chiral auxiliaries, and ligands. Leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) is frequently used to prepare l-tert-leucine from the α-keto acid precursor trimethylpyruvate (TMP). In this study, a high-throughput screening method for the l-tert-leucine synthesis reaction based on a spectrophotometric approach was developed. Directed evolution strategy was applied to engineer LeuDH from Lysinibacillus sphaericus for improved efficiency of l-tert-leucine synthesis. After two rounds of random mutagenesis, the specific activity of LeuDH on the substrate TMP was enhanced by more than two-fold, compared with that of the wild-type enzyme, while the activity towards its natural substrate, leucine, decreased. The catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of the best mutant enzyme, H6, on substrates TMP and NADH were all enhanced by more than five-fold as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. The efficiency of l-tert-leucine synthesis by mutant H6 was significantly improved. A productivity of 1170 g/l/day was achieved for the mutant enzyme H6, compared with 666 g/l/day for the wild-type enzyme. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20160902001920,,"Zhu, Lin (1, 4); Wu, Zhe (1); Jin, Jian-Ming (2, 3); Tang, Shuang-Yan (1) ","(1) CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China (2) Beijing Key Laboratory of Plant Resources Research and Development, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing; 100048, China (3) Key Laboratory of Ethnic Medicine Resource Chemistry, State Ethnic Affairs Commission & Ministry of Education, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China (4) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China ",AMBIDG,461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.1 Pulp and Paper - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Efficiency - Enzyme activity - Substrates - Thermomechanical pulping process - Throughput,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Shuang-Yan(tangsy@im.ac.cn) ",10.1007/s00253-016-7371-5,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320614,,,,01757598,13,"July 1, 2016",English,Amino acids,,34.0,5805-5813,,2016,Springer Verlag,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,,Directed evolution of leucine dehydrogenase for improved efficiency of l-tert-leucine synthesis,,Directed evolution - High throughput screening - l-tert-Leucine - Leucine dehydrogenase - Trimethylpyruvate,100
Chem. Eng. Trans.,"High specific surface areas mesoporous carbon materials were prepared by a combined method of carbonization and activation processes, in which Chinese herb residue was used as carbon source, and KOH was used as activator, respectively. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were employed to determine by the specific surface areas and pore analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy(SEM) was used for analyzing morphology structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used for analyzing the crystal forms of the materials. Thesurface functional groups were tested by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the optimum KOH/carbon ration and activation temperature is 4:1and 750°C for the mesoporous carbon materials prepared with traditional Chinese medicine residue. The structure of the materials were of nongraphitized carbonaceous materials, which possess the best surface morphology and porous performance. The porous structure of the surface is a regular shape, and the specific surface is as were as high as 2079 m2/g. After activation, the amount of microporous of the materials was decreased, and the proportion of mesoporous is increased, which result in the mesoporous ratio and average pore size increased to 79.10% and 6.78nm, respectively.

It is a prerequisite to make full use of the PD detection technology by ensuring the sensitivity and appropriate arrangement of UHF sensors. This paper presents a method for the evaluation on the performance of UHF sensors and their validity of arrangement on GIS. The influences of the typical GIS components to the propagation of UHF PD signals are researched, and then a database containing attenuation of the UHF PD signals in GIS of different nominal voltages and structures is constructed. Based on the calibration results of the effective height of UHF sensors and the attenuation database, evaluation software of UHF PD sensor arrangement for GIS is developed.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Multi-relational community detection is a very important task in social network analysis because in the real world social networks are mostly multi-relational. In this paper, we propose a user-dependent method to detect communities in multi-relational social networks. We define a multi-relational community as a shared community over multiple single-relational graphs while the quality of a partitioning of nodes is assessed by a multi-relational modularity, and we design a desirable set of communities to represent the requests of users and use Normalized mutual information (NMI) between the desirable set of communities and the sets of communities detected in each single-relational graph as the weights for measuring the importance of all kinds of relationship types. We then use a greedy agglomerative manner to identify communities. Experiments have been conducted on synthetic networks to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20164502976855,,"Yang, Peizhong (1); Zhou, Lihua (1); Chen, Hongmei (1) ","(1) School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 971 Social Sciences",184979.0,"September 23, 2016 - September 25, 2016","Suzhou, China","18th International Conference on Web Technologies and Applications, APWeb 2016 and Workshop on 2nd International Workshop on Web Data Mining and Applications, WDMA 2016 and 1st International Workshop on Graph Analytics and Query Processing, GAP 2016 and 1st International Workshop on Spatial-temporal Data Management and Analytics, SDMA 2016",Data mining - Information management - Population dynamics - Social networking (online),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Lihua(lhzhou@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-45835-9_14,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61262069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: XT412011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61262069, No. 61472346, the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2015FB114, No. 2015FB149, No. 2016FA026, Program for Young and Middle-aged Skeleton Teachers, Yunnan University, and Program for Innovation Research Team in Yunnan University under Grant No. XT412011.",9783319458342.0,03029743,,2016,English,Space division multiple access,"Web Technologies and Applications - APWeb 2016 Workshops, WDMA, GAP, and SDMA, Proceedings",23.0,152-163,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,User-dependent multi-relational community detection in social networks,,Community detection - Multi-relational modularity - Normalized mutual information - Real-world - Relational graph - Synthetic networks - User-dependent,9865 LNCS

Water,"Quantifying the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes will contribute to regional water resource planning and management. This study aims to separate the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes in the upper catchment of the Red River Basin in China. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test methods were applied to identify the trends and change points of the hydro-meteorological variables. The hydrological sensitivity, climate elasticity and hydrological simulation methods were adopted to estimate the contributions of climate variability and human activities to runoff changes. Results showed that annual runoff significantly decreased by 1.57 mm/year during the period of 1961-2012. A change point in annual runoff coefficient occurred in 2002. Accordingly, the annual runoff series were divided into the baseline period (1961-2002) and the impacted period (2003-2012). Mean annual runoff of the impacted period decreased by 29.13% compared with the baseline period. Similar estimates of the contributions of climate variability and human activities were obtained by the three different methods. Climate variability was estimated to be responsible for 69%-71% of the reduction in annual runoff, and human activities accounted for 29%-31%. Climate variability was the main driving factor for runoff decrease in the catchment. © 2016 by the authors.",Open Access,20164202915106,414.0,"Li, Yungang (1, 2); He, Daming (1, 2); Li, Xue (2); Zhang, Yueyuan (2); Yang, Liyan (2) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of International Rivers and Transboundary Eco-Security, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Asian International Rivers Center, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444.1 Surface Water - 912.2 Management,,,,,Catchments - Elasticity - Human resource management - Rivers - Runoff - Testing - Watersheds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","He, Daming(dmhe@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.3390/w8090414,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20734441,"Number: 2016YFA0601601, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41301099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41301099), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant 2016YFA0601601).

Considering that most fluctuation indices can only characterize one aspect of fluctuations, namely, the quantitative or contour variations, we present a new index that uses the standard deviation (SD) and rotation angle to detect the quantitative variations and contour changes, respectively. Herein, the new index is compared with commonly used indices, specifically, the first-order difference, SD, and Richards-Baker flashiness indices. The results of tests performed using various processes and disposals show that: (1) when dealing with the process by moving average, repeating or overlay disposal, the new index performs comparably to the other indices, while when dealing with the process by zooming disposal, it more fully describes the fluctuation characteristics by taking both quantitative and contour variations into consideration; (2) when the new index is used to characterize the hydro-wind output fluctuations with different resources and capacities, the outcomes coincide with the mechanisms of hydro-wind systems. This study presents a new way to characterize the fluctuation of hydro-wind output. © 2016 by the authors.",Open Access,20161002049925,,"Wang, Xianxun (1, 2); Mei, Yadong (1, 2); Cai, Hao (1, 2); Cong, Xiangyu (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Water Resource and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei; 430072, China (2) Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Water Resources Security, Wuhan, Hubei; 430072, China (3) POWERCHINA Kunming Engineering Corporation Limited, Kunming, Yunnan; 650051, China ",,"452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,Electric utilities - Statistics - Wind power,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Mei, Yadong(ydmei@whu.edu.cn) ",10.3390/en9020114,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19961073,"Number: 51239004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51479140, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work is supported by the Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51479140) and the Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51239004).,,,2,2016,English,Waste disposal,,36.0,1-17,,2016,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Energies,,A new fluctuation index: Characteristics and application to hydro-wind systems,,First order differences - Fluctuation characteristics - Hydro-wind output - Moving averages - Output fluctuations - Primary factors - Rotation angles - Standard deviation,9
Zhongguo Jiguang,"Laser butter welding is implemented by 6 kW fiber laser on 800 MPa dual phase cold rolled steel sheet with 1.5 mm thickness. The microstructure evolution of laser welding joint, its effect on microhardness and fatigue properties are studied. The results show that the weld joint consists of weld zone (WZ), coarse-grain heat affected zone (CGHAZ), fine-grain HAZ (FGHAZ), mixed-grain HAZ (MGHAZ) and tempering zone (TZ). The microstructure of WZ and CGHAZ are martensite, and columnar crystals morphology is retained on original austenite grains in WZ, whereas polygonal original austenite grains are observed in CGHAZ. The microstructure of FGHAZ and MGHAZ are ferrite and martensite, and finer microstructure is obtained in FGHAZ. The microstructure of TZ consists of ferrite and tempering martensite. The microhardnesses of both MGHAZ and TZ are lower than that of base metal, and they form the softening zone of the welded joint together. Tensile fracture is in the base metal because of the narrow soften zone (0.4 mm) and low microhardness drop (~6.8%). In tension-tension fatigue tests (stress ratio is 0.1), the fatigue limit of base metal and weld joints are 545 MPa and 475 MPa respectively. Fatigue fractures are not in softening zone. The fatigue crack propagates along the phase interface between ferrite and martensite in base metal. Whereas, the fatigue crack of welded joint occurs on the austenite grain boundaries or martrnsite lath in WZ, and propagates along the intersection of columnar original austenite grain boundaries in the center of WZ, which cuts off martensite lath beam to propagate. © 2016, Chinese Lasers Press.

Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng,"Ti-35Nb-7Zr-10 Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) composites were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technology from 950 to 1150. The effects of the sintering temperature on the relative density, microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the composites were investigated. The results show that the composites consist of β-Ti phase matrix, a little residual α-Ti phase and metal-ceramic phases (Ti2O, CaO, CaTiO3, CaZrO3and TixPy). With the sintering temperature increasing, the residual α-Ti phase decreases, while the metal-ceramic phase gradually increases. The elastic modulus and compressive strength of the composites increase with the sintering temperature rising. However, when the sintering temperature is over 1050, metal-ceramic phases rapidly increases due to the violent reaction between metal and ceramic, which leads to the elastic modulus increasing drastically. Thus, when the sintering temperature are between 1000~1050, the elastic modulus and compressive strength of composites are in the range of 42~45 GPa and 1240~1330 MPa, respectively, revealing better overall mechanical properties. At the same time, the surface of the composite after soaking in SBF for 7 d forms a dense bone-like apatite layer, which shows a good bioactivity. © 2016, Science Press.

Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrol. Sin.,"I.uziyuan super-large Pb-Zn-Fe polymetallic deposit is a typical representative of the similar deposits located in Baoshan bloek. The ore bodies oeeur as statiform-like along the strata, and the ore-hearing wall-roeks are mainly skarns. 'Il>e geological, geophysical, geochemical prospecting and remote sensing interpretation evidences all showed that the concealed roek body existed in the deep. While the inferred hidden body and the accurate mineralization age hasn' t been found and obtained in the known deposit, thus the ore genesis still remains controversial. This research discovers that there is an obvious Symbiotic relationship between rhodonite and iron, lead-zinc, and copper ores. In addition, the amount and grain size of rhodonite gradually increase down the deep. All these phenomena ohserved in the deposit are of great significance for us to undeistand the origin of it. Major, trace, rare earth elements and H-0 isotope compositions of the rhodonite are studied in this paper, with the rults that the rhodonite mainly comprises SiO2of 47. 01%∼ 48. 66%, Mn() of 34. 42% - 40. 19%, CaO of 7. 52% ∼ 8. 51 %, FeC) of 2. 85% ∼ 8. 76%, MgO of 0. 22% ∼ 0. 28%, and lower TiO2, and Al2O3. The incompatible elements (such as Li, Be, Sc, Zr, Bb, Sr) are not depleted, or weakly depleted in the rhodonite; while some compatible elements including Cr, (x>, and Ni are obviously depleted; the BFEs' total contents of both rhodonite and sphalerite are lower δDV.SH0W and δ18sOH20values of the rhodonite range from -81. l%c to -73.3%c, 5.4%c to 6. respectively, which are all plotted within magmatic waters' area on the 5l)v.S|,o∗ diagram. Y/Ho value of ore minerals is relatively identical to the surrounding Yanshanian granites such as Zhibenshan and Caojian. All of tlie above-mentioned features demonstrate that the metallogenic fluids of Luziyuan deposit are characterized by the deep magmatic hydrothermal solutions. Therefore, it is suggested that the luziyuan Pb-Zn-Fe polymetallic deposit is a distal-skarn type Pb-Zn deposit closely related to the concealed intermediate and acidic igneous rocks of Yanshan Period.",,20163502749331,,"Deng, MingGuo (1); Xu, Rung (1); Wang, Feng (1); Sun, BaiDong (2); Zeng, Lei (3); Yu, Haijun (2); Wang, Tao (2); Sha, JianZe (2) ","(1) Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Bureau of Geological Survey, Kunming; 650051, China (3) Geological Team 137 of Sichuan, Coalfield Geology Bureau, Dazhou; 635000, China ",,461.4 Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering - 481.1 Geology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 482.2 Minerals - 545.1 Iron - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and Alloys - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Audition - Binary alloys - Deposits - Economic geology - Exploratory geochemistry - Igneous rocks - Iron research - Isotopes - Lead alloys - Lead zinc deposits - Lutetium alloys - Magnesia - Rare earths - Remote sensing - Silica - Silicate minerals - Ternary alloys - Titanium dioxide - Trace elements - Zinc alloys - Zinc sulfide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20958927,,,,10000569,8,2016,Chinese,Ores,,80.0,2248-2264,,2016,Science Press,Yanshi Xuebao/Acta Petrologica Sinica,,Geochemistry of the rhodonite in the Luziyuan Pb-Zn-Fe polymetallic deposit in West Yunnan and their genesis significance,,Geochemical prospecting - Hydrothermal solution - Luziyuan in west yunnan - Major elements - Pb-zn deposits - Remote sensing interpretation - Rhodonite - Symbiotic relationship,32
Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao,"Incisional hernia is an abdominal wall defect that occurs in the original incision area. Accurate positioning of surgery incision has important clinical value for incisional hernia diagnosis. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for abdominal surgery incision detection based on automated 3D ultrasound coronal plane images. Firstly, the coronal plane ultrasound images are filtered by using Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion method. Then, the image pre-processing operations are used to reduce the amount of calculation and improve the execution efficiency. Finally, a straight-line equation of the original surgery incision is obtained by using edge detection, maximum distance screening and linear fitting. It is shown in the results that the fitting line of the surgery incision is very close to the location of the actual surgery incision, which means the algorithm has satisfied fitting features and high detection precision. © 2016, Science Press.

J Sol Gel Sci Technol,"Abstract: We prepared the carboxymethyl-dithiocarbamate-functionalized silica nanoparticle for detecting silver ions in aqueous media. The functionalized silica nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The functionalized silica nanoparticles realize highly sensitive and selective detection for Ag+in aqueous solution with an apparent color change over a pH range of 4–6 and under interfering ions. The functionalized silica nanoparticles allow fast detection for Ag+at 90 °C with a low minimum detectable concentration (0.09 mM). And a remarkable color change also occurs in the presence of Ag+solutions containing EDTA. This developed technique can easy and fast detect silver ions by the naked eye without using any sophisticated instrumentation.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"ML-kNN is a well-known algorithm for multi-label classification, but it just assumes the independence of labels and instances. In fact, in the real world, labels or instances are more or less related via explicit or implicit relationships. In this paper, we propose an improved ML-kNN approach that takes the coupled similarity of attributes and labels into account, where coupling between attributes is used to find k nearest neighbors for instances and coupling between labels is used to predict the labels of unseen instances. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the traditional ML-kNN. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20164502976874,,"Yang, Xiaodan (1); Zhou, Lihua (1); Wang, Lizhen (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.5 Optimization Techniques,184979.0,"September 23, 2016 - September 25, 2016","Suzhou, China","18th International Conference on Web Technologies and Applications, APWeb 2016 and Workshop on 2nd International Workshop on Web Data Mining and Applications, WDMA 2016 and 1st International Workshop on Graph Analytics and Query Processing, GAP 2016 and 1st International Workshop on Spatial-temporal Data Management and Analytics, SDMA 2016",Classification (of information) - Data mining - Information management,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Lihua(lhzhou@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-45835-9_7,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FA026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61262069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: XT412011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61262069, No. 61472346, the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province under Grant No. 2015FB114, No. 2015FB149, No. 2016FA026, Program for Young and Middle-aged Skeleton Teachers, Yunnan University, and Program for Innovation Research Team in Yunnan University under Grant No. XT412011.",9783319458342.0,03029743,,2016,English,Nearest neighbor search,"Web Technologies and Applications - APWeb 2016 Workshops, WDMA, GAP, and SDMA, Proceedings",18.0,77-89,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,An improved ML-kNN approach based on coupled similarity,,Coupled similarity - Implicit relationships - K-nearest neighbors - Multi label classification - Real-world,9865 LNCS
"Int. Conf. Big Data Smart Comput., BigComp","Spatial co-locations represent the subsets of spatial features which are frequently located together in a geographic space. Discovering co-locations has many useful applications. For example, co-located plant species discovered from plant distribution datasets can contribute to the analysis of plant geography, phytosociology studies, and plant protection recommendations. This paper focuses on incremental mining of co-locations. Because of the speed of updated data and the difficulty of incremental mining of co-locations, incremental mining of co-locations should be given more attention. In this paper, a novel method of incremental mining is proposed, which begins with maximal prevalent co-locations in old database, to search the dividing line that partitions the prevalent and non-prevalent co-locations in updated database. For a co-location candidate, the new measure, updated participation ratio (index), is used to evaluate its prevalence in the updated database. This can be easily done by using the old co-location instances, querying the disappeared co-location instances, and generating the added co-location instances. Next, a pruning strategy can prune part of co-locations for improving the efficiency. At last, the experiments evaluate the efficiency of proposed methods. © 2016 IEEE.",,20161802331632,7425803.0,"Lu, Junli (1); Wang, Lizhen (1); Fang, Yuan (1); Bao, Xuguang (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.3 Database Systems - 913.1 Production Engineering,119851.0,"January 18, 2016 - January 20, 2016","Hong Kong, China","International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing, BigComp 2016",Data mining - Database systems - Efficiency - Location - Query processing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425803,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by grants (No. 61472346, No.61262069) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and in part by a grant (No. 2015FB149, No. 2015FB114) from the Science Foundation of Yunnan Province.",9781467387965.0,,,2016,English,Big data,"2016 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing, BigComp 2016",19.0,69-76,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing, BigComp 2016",,A novel method on incremental mining of spatial co-locations,,Co-locations - Incremental mining - Maximal prevalent patterns - Participation ratios - Plant distributions - Plant protection - Pruning strategy - Spatial data mining,

Firstly, the minority documents are collected by means of high definition photography or scanning to establish a 3D model database, the science, high precision and permanent preservation of endangered document resources will come true. Secondly, we can construct the digital protection technology network platform of the ancient books of minority nationality in Yunnan through the combined ways of building a front desk virtual scene by X3D language and building a background application system by Java language. Then, through the comprehensive application of Kinect and Leap Motion somatosensory recognition technology to achieve the multi-dimensional interaction between the user and the system, it can enhance operability. Finally, the ancient literature can be displayed more vivid, more realistic and more comprehensive through the network in a wide range, so that the ancient books can be out of the geographical restrictions to achieve resource sharing. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171503559894,7879690.0,"Wu, Xu (1); Lei, Wu (1); Tong, Duan Xi (1); Long, Ren Yi (1); Jin, He (1) ","(1) School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",,"406.2 Roads and Streets - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",126845.0,"August 20, 2016 - August 22, 2016","Harbin, China","2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016",Image processing - Virtual reality,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICEICT.2016.7879690,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509007288.0,,,"March 15, 2017",English,Roads and streets,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016",8.0,231-235,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016","China Academy of Space Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Space Microwave; Science and Technology on Millimeter-Wave Laboratory; State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University",Digital protection and inheritance of culture under the background of 'The Belt and Road Initiative',,Background applications - Digital - Digital protection - Ethnic minorities - Multi dimensional - National ancient literature - Somatosensory - The Belt and Road,
IET Syst. Biol.,"The primary objective of this study is to study oscillatory expression of gene regulatory network in Escherichia coli mediated by microRNAs (sRNAs) with transcriptional and translational time delays. Motivated by the regulation of gene expression proposed by Shimoni et al. (Molecular Systems Biology, 2007), a general model of delayed gene regulatory network by sRNAs is formulated. This model can well describe many practical architectures of gene regulatory network by sRNAs, particularly when both transcriptional and translational time delays are introduced. Two functional issues on oscillatory expression of the gene regulatory network, i.e. stability and bifurcation, are investigated. Furthermore, an explicit algorithm determining the direction of Hopf bifurcation and stability of bifurcating periodic solutions is presented. It turns out that both transcriptional and translational time delays can induce gene expression in E. coli to be oscillatory even when its deterministic counterpart exhibits no oscillations. Moreover, the obtained results are in consistence with the experimental observations found in the biological literatures (Elowitz MB et al.: Nature, 2000, 403, pp. 335-338; Lennart Hilbert et al.: Mol. BioSyst, 2011, 7, pp. 2599-2607), which demonstrates that both transcriptional and translational time delays play an important role in the gene regulatory process of E. coli. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,20164903089071,,"Zhang, Yuan (1, 3); Liu, Haihong (2); Zhou, Jin (1, 3) ","(1) Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, Shanghai University, Shanghai; 200072, China (2) Department of Mathematics, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China (3) Shanghai Key Laboratory of Mechanics in Energy Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai; 200072, China ",,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 713 Electronic Circuits - 921 Mathematics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity,,,,,Escherichia coli - Gene expression regulation - Hopf bifurcation - RNA - Time delay,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Jin(jzhou@shu.edu.cn) ",10.1049/iet-syb.2016.0017,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2015FB140, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 11402225, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11562021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11272191, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the editor and the reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments, which improved this paper significantly.

J Therm Anal Calor,"Stearic acid/diatomite composite form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) have been prepared by using a direct impregnation method without vacuum treatment. The surface morphology, chemical compatibility, thermal properties and thermal stability were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetric analysis (TG), respectively. The results show that there are only physical interactions between stearic acid and diatomite in composite PCM. XRD analysis reveals that crystal type is not affected by composite technology of SA/diatomite composite form-stable PCM with decrease in crystal size due to the limited pores in diatomite. The melting and freezing temperatures of stearic acid/diatomite composite, respectively, are 52.3 and 48.4°C. The latent heat of SA/diatomite composite reaches 57.1 J g-1, potential to be used in a practical application. TG result indicates that the decomposition of SA/diatomite composite starts at 192°C, implying that the SA/diatomite has a good thermal stability. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",,20160301821904,,"Fu, Xiaowei (1); Liu, Zhimeng (1); Wu, Bo (1); Wang, Jiliang (2); Lei, Jingxin (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610065, China (2) School of Chemistry Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",JTACF7,633.1 Vacuum Applications - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 944.6 Temperature Measurements,,,,,Chemical analysis - Chemical stability - Differential scanning calorimetry - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Heat storage - Impregnation - Scanning electron microscopy - Stearic acid - Thermal energy - Thermodynamic properties - Thermodynamic stability - Thermogravimetric analysis - Vacuum applications - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lei, Jingxin(jxlei@scu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s10973-015-5030-1,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15882926,,,,13886150,2,"February 1, 2016",English,Phase change materials,,35.0,1173-1181,,2016,Springer Netherlands,Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,,Preparation and thermal properties of stearic acid/diatomite composites as form-stable phase change materials for thermal energy storage via direct impregnation method,,Chemical compatibility - Composite phase change materials - Composite technology - Differential scanning calorimeters - Form stable phase change material - Fourier transform infrared spectrometer - Freezing temperatures - Physical interactions,123
Water Resour. Manage.,"Rapid urbanization and population growth have resulted in worldwide serious water shortage and environmental deterioration. It is then essential for efficient and feasible allocation of scarce water and environment resources to the competing users. Due to inherent uncertainties, decisionmaking for resources allocation is vulnerable to failure. The scheme feasibility can be evaluated by reliability, representing the failure probability. A progressive reliabilityoriented multi-objective (PROMO) optimal decision-making procedure is proposed in this study to deal with problems with numerous reliability objectives. Dimensionality of the objectives is reduced by a top-down hierarchical reliability analysis (HRA) process combining optimization with evaluation. Pareto solutions of the reformulated model, representing alternative schemes non-dominated with each other, are generated by a metalmodel-based optimization algorithm. Evaluation and identification of Pareto solutions are conducted by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The PROMO procedure is demonstrated for a case study on industrial structure transformation under strict constraints of water resources and total environmental emissions amounts in Guangzhou City, South China. The Pareto front reveals tradeoffs between economic returns of the industries and system reliability. For different reliability preference scenarios, the Pareto solutions are ranked and the top-rated one was recommended for implementation. The model results indicate that the PROMO procedure is effective for model solving and scheme selection of uncertainty-based multi-objective decision making. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",,20165203193359,,"Dong, Feifei (1); Liu, Yong (1); Su, Han (1); Liang, Zhongyao (1); Zou, Rui (2, 3); Guo, Huaicheng (1) ","(1) College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (MOE), Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Tetra Tech, Inc, 10306 Eaton Place, Ste 340, Fairfax; VA; 22030, United States (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China ",,444 Water Resources - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 912.2 Management - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Decision making - Decision theory - Evolutionary algorithms - Hierarchical systems - Industrial emissions - Optimization - Population statistics - Resource allocation - Stochastic programming - Stochastic systems - Uncertainty analysis - Water resources,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Yong(yongliu@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11269-015-1192-7,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15731650,"Number: 20120001110056, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CICREQ, Sponsor: Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality; Number: 2012ZX07503-002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41222002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41222002), China National Water Pollution Control Program (2012ZX07503-002), the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (20120001110056), and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality.",,09204741,2,2016,English,Reliability analysis,,38.0,805-822,,2016,Springer Netherlands,Water Resources Management,,Uncertainty-based multi-objective decision making with hierarchical reliability analysis under water resources and environmental constraints,,Environmental deterioration - Hierarchical reliability analysis - Industrial structure transformation - Multi objective decision making - Multi objective evolutionary algorithms - Multi-criteria decision analysis - Trade-off analysis - Water resources allocations,30

Firstly, use the supervised-LDA model to extract user topics from micro-blogging data and calculate the similarity between users integrating the follow relationship between them. Then choose the initial clustering center of social circle to cluster user nodes and merge those social circles with a high overlapping degree to detect a social circle finally. The experiment proves that our social circle detection algorithm can not only be used to detect the unknown social circles, but also mine the topics of social circles. Also the comparison with the traditional social circle detection algorithms shows that our algorithm is more effective. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171503564694,7875973.0,"Hou, Jiaying (1); Yu, Zhengtao (1); Hong, Xudong (1); Wang, Liren (1) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Yunnan; 650500, China ",,"716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",126803.0,"November 21, 2016 - November 23, 2016","Tainan, Taiwan","20th International Conference on Asian Language Processing, IALP 2016",Big data - Blogs - Natural language processing systems - Signal detection,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/IALP.2016.7875973,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61472168, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61175068, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (61175068, 61472168)",9781509009213.0,,,"March 10, 2017",English,Data mining,"Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Asian Language Processing, IALP 2016",13.0,222-227,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Asian Language Processing, IALP 2016",Industrial Technology Research Institute; Ministry of Science and Technology,Social circle detection based on micro-blogging topic and user follow relationship,,Follow relationships - Initial clustering centers - Lda models - Micro blogging - Micro-blog - Similar Interests - Social circles - User nodes,
J. Iron Steel Res. Int.,"The crystallization behavior of mold fluxes containing 0-8 mass% TiO2was investigated using the single hot thermocouple technique (SHTT) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to study the possible effects on the coordination of heat transfer control and strand lubrication for casting crack-sensitive peritectic steels. Time-temperature-transformation (TTT) and continuous-cooling-transformation (CCT) curves were plotted using the data obtained from SHTT to characterize the crystallization of the mold fluxes. The results showed that crystallization of the mold fluxes during isothermal and non isothermal processes was suppressed with TiO2addition. From the TTT curves, it could be seen that the incubation and growth time of crystallization increased significantly with TiO2addition. The CCT curves showed that the crystallization temperature initially decreased, and then suddenly increased with increasing the TiO2content. XRD analysis suggested the presence of cuspidine in the mold fluxes with lower TiO2content (2content was increased to 8 mass%). In addition, the growth mechanisms of the crystals changed during the isothermal crystallization process from interface-controlled growth to diffusion-controlled growth with increasing the TiO2content. © 2016 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.",,20161602264153,,"Lei, Yun (1); Xie, Bing (2); Ma, Wen-Hui (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China ",,408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 482.2 Minerals - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 944.5 Temperature Measuring Instruments,,,,,Crystallization - Enzyme kinetics - Fluxes - Heat transfer - Isotherms - Metadata - Molds - Perovskite - Process control - Steel structures - Thermocouples - Titanium dioxide - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xie, Bing(bingxie@cqu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/S1006-706X(16)30052-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22103988,,,,1006706X,4,"April 1, 2016",English,Chromium compounds,,20.0,322-328,,2016,Gangtie Yanjiu Xuebao,Journal of Iron and Steel Research International,,Analysis of Crystallization Behavior of Mold Fluxes Containing TiO2Using Single Hot Thermocouple Technique,,CCT curve - Continuous cooling transformation curves - Diffusion controlled growth - Hot thermocouple - Interface-controlled growth - Mold fluxes - Time temperature transformation - TTT curves,23

Eur J Oper Res,"The linguistic term set is an applicable and flexible technique in qualitative decision making (QDM). To further develop the linguistic term set, this paper proposes a generalized asymmetric linguistic term set (GALTS) based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics, which belongs to an asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, and can be used to address the QDM problems involving risk appetites of the decision maker (DM). Then, a value-at-risk fitting (VARF) approach is designed for obtaining the risk appetite parameters of the GALTS and six desirable properties of the GALTS are analyzed, i.e., asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. Based on the above approaches and the generalized asymmetric linguistic preference relations (GALPRs), a QDM process involving risk appetites of the DM is designed. Because the GALPRs consist of subjective information provided by the DM, the process is not perfectly consistent and is usually difficult to change or repeat. Thus, a transitivity improvement approach is investigated, and the corresponding calculation steps are provided. Finally, an example dealing with the problem of investment decision making is provided, and the results fully demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods for QDM involving risk appetites. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Can. J. Chem. Eng.,"A new local-based data regression technique named locality preserving regression (LPR) is developed and applied for soft sensor modelling in the present study. By taking the local variation obtained by locality preserving projections into consideration, the regression algorithm LPR is employed to construct a soft sensor model and applied to industrial case. Furthermore, to deal with the time-varying behaviour of the process variables, just-in-time learning is also integrated to regularly update the soft sensor. Two case studies on a fermentation process for penicillin concentration prediction and the Tennessee Eastman process for output component prediction are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed local-based technique for soft sensor modelling are assessed and compared with the global-based soft sensors based on the mean square error and the coefficient of determination. Experimental results showed that the novel soft sensor model could estimate the output with higher accuracy and generalization ability than the general soft sensor based on the global information. © 2016 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering",,20163702792737,,"Miao, Aimin (1); Li, Peng (1); Ye, Lingjian (2) ","(1) Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Ningbo; Zhejiang; 315100, China ",CJCEA7,922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Just in time production - Mean square error,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Peng(lipeng@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1002/cjce.22568,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1939019X,"Number: 20130101110138, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014FB112, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61540070, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (61540070), the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (20130101110138), the Science and Technology plan of Applied Basic Research Programs Foundation of Yunnan province (2014FB112), and the 5th Training Program for the Key Young Teachers of Yunnan University.",,00084034,10,"October 1, 2016",English,Regression analysis,,52.0,1977-1986,,2016,Wiley-Liss Inc.,Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering,,Locality preserving based data regression and its application for soft sensor modelling,,Coefficient of determination - Generalization ability - Just-in-time learning - Locality preserving projections - Manifold learning - Penicillin concentration - Soft sensors - Tennessee Eastman process,94

Hupo Kexue/J. Lake Sc.,"To understand the temporal-spatial characteristics of the diffuse attenuation of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and its relationship with chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suspended solids (SS), chlorophyll-a (Chl.a) and other factors in Lake Fuxian, an oligotrophic deep lake in Yunnan Plateau, we carried out an investigation based on field work in October 2014 (autumn) and January 2015 (winter). The results showed that the values of diffuse attenuation coefficient that Kd(305), Kd(340) and Kd(PAR) were 1.27±0.12 m-1, 0.68±0.11 m-1and 0.32±0.13 m-1, respectively in autumn, which were 1.13±0.10 m-1, 0.63±0.07 m-1and 0.36±0.07 m-1, respectively in winter. Meanwhile, the values of absorption coefficient of CDOM that ag(254), ag(305) and ag(340) were 4.09±0.26 m-1, 1.18±0.09 m-1, 0.57±0.05 m-1, respectively in autumn, which were 2.95±0.24 m-1, 0.61±0.11 m-1, 0.11±0.07 m-1, respectively in winter. The values of of ag(254), ag(305) and ag(340)in autumn were significantly higher than in winter. The values of of Kd(305) in autumn were significantly higher than in winter, which was related with higher CDOM abundance, phytoplankton biomass (and SS concentration) in autumn (rainy season). Furthermore, the values of ag(305)/Kd(305) and ag(340)/Kd(340) in autumn were significantly higher than which in winter; there were significant positive correlations between ag(254) and Kd(305), Kd(340), and the ag(254) included in all stepwise regression equations both in autumn and autumn-winter, indicated that the absorption of CDOM was an important factor affecting on the diffuse attenuation of UVR. Moreover, there were obvious differences depend on spatial distribution of ag(254), Kd(305) and Kd(340) in autumn, the values of ag(254), Kd(305) and Kd(340) in the north region of the lake was significantly higher than in the south region, whereas there were no significant differences between the north and south regions of ag(254), Kd(305) and Kd(340) in winter, which might be related with the different river input scenarios of CDOM and SS from the northern shore between autumn (rainy season) and winter (dry season). In addition, the influences of phytoplankton on UV-B attenuation, the interaction between SS and CDOM on UV-A attenuation were reflected in seasonal changes. However, the relative contribution of pure water, CDOM, phytoplankton and tripton to spectral attenuation (including UVR and PAR) should be quantized in future. © 2016 by Journal of Lake Sciences.",Open Access,20164603016075,,"Zhou, Qichao (1, 2); Zhang, Yunlin (2); Zhou, Yongqiang (2, 3); Chen, Yiliang (1); Qin, Jiang (1); Nie, Jufen (1) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Yunnan Institute of Environmental Science, Kunming China International Research Center for Plateau Lake, Kunming; 650034, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing; 210008, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China ",,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 481.2 Geochemistry - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Biogeochemistry - Dissolution - Lakes - Organic compounds - Phytoplankton - Spatial distribution - Ultraviolet radiation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yunlin(ylzhang@niglas.ac.cn) ",10.18307/2016.0617,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10035427,6,"October 6, 2016",Chinese,Biological materials,,40.0,1316-1327,,2016,Science Press,Hupo Kexue/Journal of Lake Sciences,,"Spectral attenuation of ultraviolet and visible radiation and its relationship with chromophoric dissolved organic matter in autumn/winter in Lake Fuxian, China",,Chromophoric dissolved organic matter - Diffuse attenuation coefficients - Euphotic - Lake Fuxian - Temporal spatial distribution,28
Expert Sys Appl,"Cloud computing technology has become increasingly popular and can deliver a host of benefits. However, there are various kinds of cloud providers in the market and firms need scientific decision tools to judge which cloud computing vendor should be chosen. Studies in how a firm should select an appropriate cloud vendor have just started. However, existing studies are mainly from the technology and cost perspective, and neglect other influence factors, such as competitive pressure and managerial skills, etc. Hence, this paper proposes a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) based scientific decision tool to help firms to judge which cloud computing vendor is more suitable for their need by considering more comprehensive influence factors. It is argued that objective attributes, i.e., cost, as well as subjective attributes, such as TOE factors (Technology, Organization, and Environment) should be considered for the decision making in cloud computing services, and presents a new subjective/objective integrated MAGDM approach for solving decision problems. The proposed approach integrates statistical variance (SV), improved techniques for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), simple additive weighting (SAW), and Delphi-AHP to determine the integrated weights of the attributes and decision-makers (DMs). The method considers both the objective weights of the attributes and DMs, as well as the subjective preferences of the DMs and their identity differences, thereby making the decision results more accurate and theoretically reasonable. A numerical example is given to illustrate the practicability and usefulness of the approach and its suitability as a decision-making tool for a firm using of cloud computing services. This paper enriches the theory and methodology of the selection problem of cloud computing vendoring and MAGDM analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Taiyangneng Xuebao,"In order to analyze the operation performance of PV power system under the mismatch condition, firstly, the model of centralized PV array with blocking shadow was derived. Under the local meteorological condition, PV system simulation software was used to simulate the effect of tilt angle, azimuth and shading on annual power generation performance of 500 kW grid-connected PV system in Shilin area. Finally, the optimization scheme of the PV system was proposed by comparing simulation result and test result of Shilin PV power system. The simulation results show that when the tilt angle is equal to the local latitude of PV system, the azimuth is zero degree, the PV system without shadings can obtain the maximum annual power generation of 704 MWh and the performance ratio of 80.1%. However, the annual power generation of the PV system with same linear shading will falls from 1% to 24.9% as tilt angle changes. The testing results show that the actual power generation declines 20% than the simulation result of PV system without shading under the average meteorological condition, the declination ratio is only 17% when the PV system with linear shadings. Furthermore, under the same meteorological condition, the error between the testing result and simulation result is only 0.01- 0.30. It can effectively decrease the mismatch loss of the centralized grid connected PV power system with appropriate installation tilt angle and azimuth of PV array. However, the uneven irradiation condition, such as shading and cloudy will increase mismatch loss of PV system. It needs optimizing the configuration of PV system or using the technology of maximum power point tracking(MPPT)to avoid the loss. © 2016, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao,"The application of RC frame structure with specially shaped columns is impaired by its defect in seismic performance. In particular, requirements on the maximum height of 12 m in seismic fortification intensity 8 (0.2g) severely limits its application in high intensity zone. Therefore, an up-to-date seismic isolation technique was adopted in this research, to improve the practical application of RC frame structure with specially shaped columns.An eight-storey (including isolation layer) seismic isolated RC frame structure with specially shaped columns was considered. The associated downscale testing model was constructed with a length scale ratio of 1/5 for shaking table test, to study the adaptability of RC frame structure with specially shaped columns combined with seismic isolators. The working status and seismic behavior of base isolated RC frame structure with specially shaped columns under seismic load was investigated. The experimental results show that base isolated RC frame structure with specially shaped columns can be designed with one level lower than the level of earthquake intensity of the fixed basement structures in seismic fortification intensity 8 (0.2g). The calculation method and details of seismic design for regular RC frame structure with base isolation can also be used to this special kind of structure. The engineering application of RC frame structure with specially shaped column can be extend by the adopted isolation technology. It has been shown that the isolation effectiveness is significantly affected by the stiffness degradation of RC frame structure with specially shaped columns in elasto-plastic stage. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of Building Structures.

Acta Tech CSAV,"Aimed at maximizing coverage area and minimizing coverage gaps, we propose a deployment algorithm named local location based self-Adjusting deployment (LLSAD) for mobile sensor network. Based on the analysis of the theory on optimal nodes layout with full coverage, a rule of sensors adjusting and location update is established. According to the rule, the sensor nodes can move close to the position of layout with full coverage in task region. The LLSAD algorithm realizes local optimal coverage by updating the local nodes' location to achieve required coverage. The simulation results have demonstrated that LLSAD can rapidly improve the coverage and achieve convergence under several different initial deployments to provide guarantee of coverage (quality of service-QoS). Moreover, sensor nodes do not need to maintain global sensor nodes' location data.

In the face of lack of the status quo of tourism data, in order to verify the validity of the model, the method transforming the tourist receipts of tourist city into tourist traffic generation of a particular city was put forward. Finally, in the instance of Shuifu city of Yunnan province, this paper predicted the strength of tourists to travel in Shuifu.

As the national leader in the development of offshore wind farms and nuclear power plants, East China Grid is also the primary receiving end of national ultra-high voltage backbone power grids. However, intermittent outputs by renewable sources and inflexible ultra-high voltage direct current together threaten the viability of maintaining reliable and high-quality electric service for consumers. This paper proposed practical ways for East China Grid Corporation to absorb renewables as much as possible under its high proportion of coal-fired power plants.

J. Biotechnol.,"Theabrownins were produced from infusions of sun-dried green tea leaves using a crude enzyme concentrate of Aspergillus tubingensis TISTR 3647. This fungus had been isolated from a solid state fermentation of Pu-erh type tea. The crude enzyme concentrate contained activities of peroxidase, catechol oxidase and laccase. The enzyme concentrate effectively oxidized the phenolic compounds in green tea infusion to theabrownins. A theabrownins concentration of 56.0 g/L was obtained in 44 h. The reaction mixture contained the green tea infusion and crude enzyme concentrate in the volume ratio of 1: 0.205. The tea infusion had been produced using 200 g of tea leaves per liter of distilled water. The reaction was carried out in a stirred bioreactor at 37 °C with an aeration rate of 1 vvm, an agitation speed of 250 rpm and a controlled pH of 7.0. Peroxidase, catechol oxidase, and laccase acted synergistically to convert the phenolic compounds in green tea infusion to theabrownins. Previously, theabrownins had been produced from green tea infusions only by using live fungal cultures. Production using the microorganism-free enzyme concentrate was comparable to production using the fungus A. tubingensis TISTR 3647. The proposed novel production process using the fungal crude enzymes and green tea infusion, offers a more controlled, reproducible and highly productive option for commercial production of theabrownins. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162702559853,,"Wang, Qiuping (1); Gong, Jiashun (2); Chisti, Yusuf (3); Sirisansaneeyakul, Sarote (1, 4) ","(1) Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Kasetsart University, 50 Ngam Wong Wan Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok; 10900, Thailand (2) Department of Food Quality and Safety, Faculty of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Heilong Tan, Kunming; Yunnan; 650201, China (3) School of Engineering, Massey University, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North, New Zealand (4) National Research University-Kasetsart University, Center for Advanced Studies in Tropical Natural Resources, Kasetsart University, (CASTNAR, NRU-KU), Chatuchak, Bangkok; 10900, Thailand ",JBITD4,445.1 Water Treatment Techniques - 461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Aspergillus - Biological water treatment - Fermentation - Phenols,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Sirisansaneeyakul, Sarote(sarote.s@ku.ac.th) ",10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.06.010,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734863,"Number: -, Acronym: KURDI, Sponsor: Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute; Number: -, Acronym: KU, Sponsor: Kasetsart University; Number: -, Acronym: IAS, Sponsor: Institute of Advanced Studies, University of Bristol; Number: -, Acronym: KURDI, Sponsor: Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute; ","The authors are grateful to Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute (KURDI) , Fermentation Technology Research Center (FTRC) , Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Kasetsart University , and the Center for Advanced Studies in Tropical Natural Resources, Kasetsart University Institute for Advanced Studies (KUIAS) , for financial support.",,01681656,,"August 10, 2016",English,Enzymes,,22.0,250-259,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Journal of Biotechnology,,Production of theabrownins using a crude fungal enzyme concentrate,,Aspergillus tubingensis - Commercial productions - Enzymatic production - Microbial fermentation - Phenolic compounds - Solid-state fermentation - Stirred bioreactors - Theabrownins,231
Appl Catal A Gen,"The removal performances of carbon disulphide (CS2) from gas streams over microwave coconut shell activated carbon (MCSAC) supported Fe (Fe/MCSAC) modified by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) non-thermal plasma (NTP) were investigated. The properties of Fe/MCSAC catalysts modified by NTP in different conditions, including the reactor structures, modification atmospheres, input voltages, treatment times and discharge intervals, were also studied. A study of the catalytic activities showed that Fe/MCSAC catalysts with NTP modification better catalytically hydrolyse CS2, and the optimal reactor type, modification atmosphere, input voltage and treatment time were a coaxial cylinder, an NH3atmosphere, 20 V, 10 min and 2 mm, respectively. Temperature programmed desorption of CO (CO-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET), theoretical calculation and Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) analysis methods, which were designed to understand the effect of the plasma treatment and the hydrolysis mechanism of CS2. The catalytic activity could be enhanced effectively by improving the dispersion of the active components and increasing the number of oxygen-containing groups and potassium-containing groups after NTP modification.

Taiyangneng Xuebao,"A novel V-shaped cavity absorber was designed, which was used in the parabolic trough solar concentrator for generating high temperature steam. The efficiency of steam generation in the system was studied by experiment and theory at different weather conditions. The results show that the system efficiency is 45.54%, average transient efficiency is 51.20% in the sunny days and system efficiency is 32.25%, average transient efficiency is 48.97% in cloudy days. The thermal performance of the system for direct steam generation was determined by the heat loss, so the model of heat loss for the cavity absorber was established. It is found that the experiment results are consistent with theory calculation results. The heat losses of the radiation and the convection are the primary heat losses of the cavity absorber. The cavity absorber has low heat loss and high efficiency with the pressure intensity no more than 0.15 MPa. © 2016, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

J Porous Mater,"Crofton weed, a kind of global exotic weeds, was utilized as materials for the preparation of activated carbon via microwave-induced KOH activation. The key parameters that characterize the activated carbon such as the BET surface area and total pore volume were estimated to be 3918 m2/g and 2.383 mL/g, respectively. The physico-chemical properties of activated carbon were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM. In addition, the activated carbon was exposed to methylene blue, which was used to model the migration of organic pollutants in the wastewater adsorption and to assess liquid phase adsorption properties.

Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao,"Based on IEEE 802.11 PCF mechanism, this paper establishes the mathematical model of the limited-K (K=1) pooling service system with sleep mechanism employing the embedded Markov chain theory and probability generating function, and accurately deduces the mathematical expression of the one-order performance characteristic, i.e. mean cyclic period. The influence of the sleep mechanism on the system is analyzed theoretically, which overcomes the shortcoming of only employing experiment & energy consumption model and ignoring sleeping status when analyzing the access mechanism of wireless sensor networks. The energy consumption and sleeping performance of the nodes were analyzed with simulation. The experiment results verify the correctness of theoretical analysis. Through introducing the sleeping factor, the calculation error of the mean cyclic period is reduced from 4 percent to almost zero, which indicates that the sleep status should not be ignored in model analysis. © 2016, Science Press.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-SiH) thin films on soda-lime glass substrates were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using disilane and hydrogen as source gases. To study the influence of deposition pressure on the deposition rate, optical band gap and structure factor, a surface profilometer, an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer, a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the deposited thin films. It is found that the deposition rate firstly increased and then decreased and the optical band gap monotonically decreased with the increasing deposition pressure. Moreover, the formation of SiH bond was preferable to the formation of SH2or SiH3bond when the deposition pressure was less than 210 Pa, while it was opposite when the deposition pressure is higher than 210 Pa. Finally, the deposition pressure in the range of 110~210 Pa was found to be more suitable for the preparation of high quality a-SiH thin films. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Huagong Jinzhan/Chem. Ind. Eng. Prog.,"Forming a stable solid electrolyte interface film (SEI film) is the key to solve the compatibility between lithium ion battery electrode material and electrolyte. Therefore, the research of high quality anode film-forming additive in electrolyte for lithium ion battery attracts much attention. The principle of film-forming additives for organic electrolyte in Li-ion batteries was reviewed. The research status of a variety of additives was particularly introduced. The recent progress on negative film-forming additives was reviewed in detail, from the perspectives of film formation mechanisms and quantum calculation. The main problem was how to select more suitable and efficient film-forming additives. In addition, the possible trends in this area were proposed: (1) Understanding the mechanism of additive reacting with the electrolyte, especially for the negative film forming additive which has minimum side effects for lithium ion battery; (2) Combining two or more additives together to compensate the deficiencies of one additive; (3) Increasing the solubility of inorganic film-forming additives in the electrolyte. © 2016, Chemical Industry Press.

When the water vapor equivalent ratio to biomass was 0.058, the yield of tar was approximately decreased by half and the hydrogen yield was improved by 63.04%, so the gasification efficiency increased to 75.03%. After obtaining the ideal experimental conditions, thermodynamic analysis of the sawdust gasification with copper slag was performed based on the energy balance. Then, the coupling relationships were obtained between copper slag, sawdust and water vapor. The sensible heat of molten copper slag was 1773kJ/kg at 1250. When making full use of copper slag comprising sensible heat and latent heat, the heat value of synthesis gas was 13319kJ from the sawdust gasification.

J. Iron Steel Res. Int.,"The grain growth (GG) behavior of Inconel 625 superalloy was studied in the temperature range of 900—1250 °C and holding time range of 10—80 min. Microstructures of the alloy were characterized by optical metallography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Grains grew obviously with either increasing temperature or extending holding time at temperatures above 1050 °C. However, at temperatures lower than 1050 °C, the GG was sluggish due to the pinning effect of carbide particles on grain boundary (GB). Threshold temperature for transition from mixed grain structure to uniform one was considered to be around 1100 °C. Once the temperatures surpassed 1200 °C, an instant increase in the grain size occurred showing no dependence on holding time. TEM analysis showed that the dominant second phase formed heterogeneously on the GB was M6C, which significantly impeded grain growth. On the basis of experimental data, the mathematical model of GG was established, which can describe GG behavior of Inconel 625 alloy during solution treatment (ST) at 1100—1250 °C. The activation energy for GG of Inconel 625 alloy was 207. 3 kJ, which suggested that the GG of Inconel 625 alloy was controlled by the process of GB diffusion. © 2016 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute",,20164603016810,,"LIU, Min (1, 2); ZHENG, Wen-jie (2); XIANG, Jin-zhong (2); SONG, Zhi-gang (2); PU, En-xiang (2, 3); FENG, Han (2) ","(1) School of Physics Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Central Iron and Steel Research Institute, Beijing; 100081, China (3) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing; 100084, China ",,531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Activation energy - Carbides - Grain boundaries - Grain size and shape - Growth kinetics - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Microstructure - Precipitation (chemical) - Scanning electron microscopy - Superalloys - Transmission electron microscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","ZHENG, Wen-jie(sxzwj@sohu.com) ",10.1016/S1006-706X(16)30164-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22103988,,,,1006706X,10,"October 1, 2016",English,Grain growth,,24.0,1111-1118,,2016,Gangtie Yanjiu Xuebao,Journal of Iron and Steel Research International,,Grain Growth Behavior of Inconel 625 Superalloy,,Carbide particles - Grain growth behavior - Inconel 625 alloys - Inconel 625 superalloys - Increasing temperatures - Optical metallography - Solution treatments - Threshold temperatures,23

Food Chem.,"A starch rich fraction is a side product in Tartary buckwheat processing. This study investigated the fractions that are of technological and nutritional interest. Tartary buckwheat starch granules had a diameter of 3-14 μm, and presented a typical type 'A' X-ray diffraction pattern. They contained nearly 39.0% amylose. The solubility of Tartary buckwheat starch was much lower at 70-90 °C (ranging within 9.9-10.4% at 90 °C) than that in maize (up to 49.3%) and potato (up to 85.0%) starch. The starch of one variety of Tartary buckwheat had significantly lower solubility at 70 °C and 80 °C than that of common buckwheat. The starch peak viscosity and breakdown were higher and pasting time was shorter in Tartary buckwheat than in that of the starch of common buckwheat. Tartary buckwheat starch had unique pasting and physicochemical properties, and is thereby capable of being exploited as a suitable raw material of retrograded starch in food processing. © 2015, Elsevier Ltd.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"A novel fluorescence material with thermo-sensitive for the enrichment and sensing of protein was successfully prepared by combining molecular imprinting technology with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Herein, the UCNPs acted as signal reporter for composite materials because of its excellent fluorescence property and chemical stability. MOFs were introduced to molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) due to its high specific surface area which increases the rate of mass transfer relative to that of traditional bulk MIP. The thermo-sensitive imprinted material which allows for swelling and shrinking with response to temperature changes was prepared by choosing Bovine hemoglobin (BHB) as the template, N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAM) as the temperature-sensitive functional monomer and N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) as the cross-linker. The recognition characterizations of imprinted material-coated UCNPs/MOFs (UCNPs/MOFs/MIP) were evaluated, and the results showed that the fluorescence intensity of UCNPs/MOFs/MIP reduced gradually with the increase of BHB concentration. The fluorescence material was response to the temperature. The adsorption capacity was as much as 167.6 mg/g at 28. °C and 101.2. mg/g at 44. °C, which was higher than that of traditional MIP. Therefore, this new fluorescence material for enrichment and sensing protein is very promising for future applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20155201727284,,"Guo, Ting (1); Deng, Qiliang (1); Fang, Guozhen (1); Gu, Dahai (2); Yang, Yukun (1); Wang, Shuo (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin; 300457, China (2) Yunnan Agricultural University, Yunnan; 650201, China ",BBIOE4,641.3 Mass Transfer - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Characterization - Chemical stability - Crystalline materials - Hemoglobin - Mammals - Mass transfer - Metal nanoparticles - Organometallics - Proteins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Deng, Qiliang(yhdql@tust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.bios.2015.12.040,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,"Number: 2013AA102202, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; Number: 2012HA009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31225021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21375094, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Project no. 2013AA102202) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project no. 21375094 and 31225021 ) and Innovation Talents of Science and Technology Plan of Yunnan Province (Project no. 2012HA009 ).

Ruan Jian Xue Bao,"The development of computer hardware technology has led to an era of multi-core CPU. However, data structures, as the core of the software, are traditionally designed in line with single-core CPU and ordered sequence principle. Operating on the shared-memory multicore, a large number of concurrent running threads alternately modify the data structure, which brings big challenges. This paper surveys researches on multi-core data structure in shared-memory. First, the paper compares the differences between the concurrent and parallel data structures, and investigates the multicore structure classification characteristics based on progress condition. Then it reviews academic research on various types of concurrent data structures in recent years.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Woodcut printing is a special art combining carving and printing skills. The difference of Yunnan Out-of-Print woodcut printing from ordinary printing is that carving alternates with printing in cycles to produce multi-color printings, and all colors are printed just out of one block which is recarved for each color. This is a complex process and requires high technical skills. We propose an image stylization method for Yunnan out-of-print woodcut through virtual carving and printing. First, image segmentation is applied to isolate areas for carving. In each segmented region, scores collected from real woodcut are placed to simulate the carving process. We introduce an algorithm to automate the placement according to the image feature. In the printing process, we mainly focus on the simulation of the mixture of oil paint and the special effect of random color blending in Yunnan out-of-print woodcut. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20162702570287,,"Li, Jie (1); Xu, Dan (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,741.1 Light/Optics - 745.1 Printing - 745.1.1 Printing Equipment,176359.0,"April 14, 2016 - April 16, 2016","Hangzhou, China","10th International Conference on E-Learning and Games, Edutainment 2016",Color - Color printing - E-learning - Printing presses,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Dan(danxu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-40259-8_19,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 61163019, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61540062, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61271361, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014FA021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by NSFC projects (No. 61163019, No. 61540062, No. 61271361), Key project of Yunnan applied basic research program (No. 2014FA021), and Digital Media Technology Key Laboratory of Universities in Yunnan.",9783319402581.0,03029743,,2016,English,Image segmentation,"E-Learning and Games - 10th International Conference, Edutainment 2016, Revised Selected Papers",12.0,212-233,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Computer Interaction; Digital Media and Interaction Research Center of Hangzhou Normal University; Hangzhou Computer Federation for Committee of Digital Media and Human-; Hangzhou Normal University; Hangzhou Science and Technology Association,Image stylization for yunnan out-of-print woodcut through virtual carving and printing,,Complex Processes - Image stylizations - Multi-color printing - Printing process - Segmented regions - Stylization - Virtual carving - Yunnan out-of-print woodcut,9654
J Alloys Compd,"MnO2hollow microspheres consisted of nanoribbons were successfully fabricated via a facile hydrothermal method with SiO2sphere templates. The crystal structure, morphology and microwave absorption properties in X and Ku band of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a vector network analyzer. The results show that the three-dimensional (3D) hollow microspheres are assembled by ultra thin and narrow one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons. A rational process for the formation of hollow microspheres is proposed. The 3D MnO2hollow microspheres possess improved dielectric and magnetic properties than the 1D nanoribbons prepared by the same procedures with the absence of SiO2hard templates, which are closely related to their special nanostructures. The MnO2microspheres also show much better microwave absorption properties in X (8-12 GHz) and Ku (12-18 GHz) microwave band compared with 1D MnO2nanoribbons. The minimum reflection loss of -40 dB for hollow microsphere can be observed at 14.2 GHz and reflection loss below -10 dB is 3.5 GHz with a thickness of only 4 mm. The possible mechanism for the enhanced microwave absorption properties is also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

RSC Adv.,"Sonchus asper L. and Vicia faba L. are a local cadmium (Cd) accumulator and a main winter crop, respectively, found in the Huize lead-zinc mining area in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. The biomass and low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) secreted by the roots of these plants, Cd and lead (Pb) contents and their accumulation in a S. asper monoculture, V. faba monoculture and S. asper/V. faba intercrop were investigated in a field experiment at 35, 80 and 180 d after planting. The results showed that (1) intercropping had no notable influences on plant biomass and grain yields of V. faba but led to a significant increase in the amount of stem and leaf biomass of S. asper at 180 d after planting. (2) The major LMWOAs secreted by the roots of both V. faba and S. asper were oxalic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid. Intercropping resulted in an increase and decrease in the LMWOA contents secreted by V. faba and S. asper roots, respectively. (3) Along with plant growth, the available Cd content decreased and the available Pb contents did not exhibit obvious changes in the soil samples of a V. faba monoculture. The amount of available Cd and Pb both increased in the soil of the S. asper monoculture, but decreased in that of the S. asper/V. faba intercrop. (4) Intercropping resulted in a decrease in the contents and accumulation of Cd and Pb in V. faba plants, but an increase in both the contents and accumulation of Cd and Pb in S. asper plants. Moreover, intercropping enhanced the enrichment and translation coefficients of Cd for S. asper. The remediation efficiency was the highest at 180 d after planting. (5) There were significant negative correlations between the contents of citric acid, malic acid (secreted by V. faba roots), oxalic acid and tartaric acid (secreted by S. asper roots) and the available Cd content in the soil samples. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the available Cd content in the soil and the Cd contents in the roots and grains of V. faba. Intercropping reduced the Cd contents in the plants and grains of V. faba and was closely related to the decrease in the available Cd content in the soil samples, which was mediated by plant roots that secreted LMWOAs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,20161702306233,,"Zhan, Fang-Dong (1); Qin, Li (1); Guo, Xian-Hua (1); Tan, Jian-Bo (1); Liu, Ning-Ning (1); Zu, Yan-Qun (1); Li, Yuan (1) ","(1) College of Resources and Environment, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China ",RSCACL,461.9 Biology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Bioaccumulation - Biomass - Cadmium - Citric acid - Molecular weight - Soil surveys - Soils,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Yuan(liyuan@ynau.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c5ra26601g,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 41261096, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1202236, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31560163, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41461093, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1202236, 41461093, 41261096 and 31560163).",,,40,2016,English,Oxalic acid,,50.0,33240-33248,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Cadmium and lead accumulation and low-molecular-weight organic acids secreted by roots in an intercropping of a cadmium accumulator Sonchus asper L. with Vicia faba L.,,Cadmium and leads - Field experiment - Lead-zinc mining - Low molecular weight organic acid - Negative correlation - Positive correlations - Remediation efficiency - Yunnan province,6
Int. Conf. Geoinformatics,"Land surface temperature is an important indicator of the earth's environmental analysis. Land surface emissivity is one of the key factors of remote sensing retrieving land surface temperature. In this paper, using the Landsat5 TM6 band data acquired in March 24, 2009 and taking Kunming city as the study area, we use NDVI threshold method and empirical formula model to calculate the land surface emissivity of Kunming city. In this paper, we apply universal single-channel algorithms to invert the surface temperature of Kunming. The results showed that: The results of land surface emissivity were calculated by NDVI threshold and empirical formula model are significantly related with MODIS surface emissivity products. The real temperature and the surface temperature inverted by two surface emissivity are little difference and they are in the accuracy of the control range. By empirical formula model calculated surface emissivity of the surface temperature anomalies in urban areas, exceeding the real temperature 2 °C-4 °C, does not accurately reflect the surface temperature. And the surface temperature inverted by the result of NDVI threshold is closer to the real surface temperature. This method could reflect the temperature under different land covers more accurately. Therefore, land cover such good in Kunming city area, with NDVI threshold method calculated surface emissivity to invert surface temperature is more appropriately. © 2015 IEEE.",,20161502221167,7378590.0,"Li, Yanfang (1, 2); Yang, Kun (2, 3); Yang, Rong (1, 2) ","(1) Yunnan Normal University, School of Tourism and Geography Science, Cartography and Geographic Information System, Kunming, China (2) Yunnan Normal University, Information, Yunnan Normal University School, Kunming, China (3) GIS Technology Research Center of Resource and Environment in Western China, Ministry of Education, Kunming, China ",,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements - 951 Materials Science,119044.0,"June 19, 2015 - June 21, 2015","Wuhan, China","23rd International Conference on Geoinformatics, Geoinformatics 2015",Electromagnetic wave emission - Remote sensing - Surface measurement - Surface properties,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Yanfang(lyfynnu@yeah.net) ",10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2015.7378590,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),21610258,,,9781467376631.0,2161024X,,"January 11, 2016",English,Atmospheric temperature,"Proceedings - 23rd International Conference on Geoinformatics 2015, Geoinformatics 2015",10.0,,1of1,2016,IEEE Computer Society,International Conference on Geoinformatics,"China Association for Geographic Information Service; Chinese Society for Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation; Natural Resources and Geospatial Information Committee, China Information Association; Wuhan Zondy Cyber Group Co., Ltd",Land surface temperature estimation from remote sensing data-a case study in Kun Ming city,,Environmental analysis - Land surface - Land surface temperature - Mixed pixel models - Model method - Single-channel algorithms - Surface temperature anomalies - Surface temperatures,2016-January

Int. Conf. Geoinformatics,"Based on geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), five primary factors affecting soil erosion in the ErHai Lake Basin are extracted rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, terrain, vegetation coverage, and soil and water conservation measures. Meanwhile, the amount of soil erosion is estimated using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model. Furthermore, the spatial distribution characteristics were also analyzed with the application of GIS in the view of elevation, slope and land use types. The results also showed that the soil erosion modulus was 64.68t/(hm2·a), which belonged to the grade of intensity erosion, and a erodible area of 1404.279km2(61.12% of the whole area). The results also revealed that soil erosion, especially soil erosion with high grade, mostly distributed in the following areas, that is elevation area from 2000 to 2500 meters, slope area from 25 to 45 degree, and unused land.

Finally, use of land use transfer matrix system quantitatively described, simultaneous analysis of the area of LUCC spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics and the factors of driving force, in order to protect the valuable forest resources and continuing effective use land resources of Binchuan to provide a scientific basis for decision making. The result indicate that: the SVM classification method overall accuracy was 89.23, with a kappa coefficient greater than 0.7. From 1995 to 2013, rural and mining residential land generally increased, except 2000, and reaching the maximum in 2013, which is almost double than in 1995. This permits Binchuan, which for nearly 20 years, has always been committed to the city and rural development. The most obvious conversion land use types were unused land and cultivated land, with cultivated land showing a clear decreasing trend, and majority of conversions were to rural and mining residential land, and unused land mostly converted to grassland and rural and mining residential land. For woodland, it experienced an initial increase, then decrease, and then finally increased procedure. However the increase of woodland area is not large (it remained in stable condition), and this proved Binchuan has an emphasis on the protection of forest resources. The water area from 1995 to 2000 years showed a substantial reduction, but in the subsequent 10 years has rebounded. However water resources is still relatively scarce, suggesting the Government to strengthen the construction of water conservancy facilities and soil and water conservation and related work.

Herein, an extremely high UV response for a ZnO nanorods/phenanthrene (Phen) photovoltaic detector has been realized, utilizing phenanthrene as a p-type wide gap organic semiconductor; a detectivity (D∗) as high as ∼9.0 × 1013cm Hz1/2W-1has been reached, showing significant potential for optoelectronic applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,20160601910159,,"Cheng, Wentao (1); Tang, Libin (1, 2); Xiang, Jinzhong (1); Ji, Rongbin (2); Zhao, Jun (2) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Kunming Institute of Physics, Kunming; 650223, China ",RSCACL,708.4 Magnetic Materials - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Heterojunctions - II-VI semiconductors - Magnetic semiconductors - Nanorods - Optoelectronic devices - Zinc oxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Libin(scitang@163.com) ",10.1039/c5ra25059e,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 2012FA003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 51201150, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61106098, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61106098, 51201150) and the Key Project of Applied Basic Research of Yunnan Province, China (No. 2012FA003).",,,15,2016,English,Wide band gap semiconductors,,25.0,12076-12080,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,An extreme high-performance ultraviolet photovoltaic detector based on a ZnO nanorods/phenanthrene heterojunction,,Detectivity - Optoelectronic applications - P-type - Photovoltaic detector - Ultra-violet - Wide gap - Wide-gap semiconductor,6
Procedia Eng.,"By utilizing the self-designed test platform to carry out tests on the edge ignition time and center ignition time of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints to different fire-retardant degrees and analyzing the factors affecting the edge ignition time and center ignition time, this paper proposes the indicators for the assessment of fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints, i.e. The edge ignition time and the center ignition time. It is indicated by research results that the paint quality, coating process and fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints can be comprehensively assessed in terms of these two indicators; the edge ignition time can be used for auxiliary assessment of the quality situation of finishing fire-retardant paints, and the center ignition time can be used for assessment of the coating process of finishing fire-retardant paints.",Open Access,20162302454057,,"Luo, Jing (1) ","(1) College of Civil Engineering, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650024, China ",,641.2 Heat Transfer - 813.2 Coating Materials - 914.2 Fires and Fire Protection,121602.0,"December 5, 2015 - December 6, 2015","Guangzhou, China","2015 7th International Conference on Performance-Based Fire and Fire Protection Engineering, ICPFFPE 2015",Fire extinguishers - Fires - Heat radiation - Paint,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Luo, Jing(lincoln558@swfu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.proeng.2016.01.089,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),18777058,,This research was supported by the Southwest Forestry University Fire Engineering Laboratory in 2014.,,,,2016,English,Fire protection,"2015 International Conference on Performance-Based Fire and Fire Protection Engineering, ICPFFPE 2015",9.0,123-127,1of1,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Procedia Engineering,City University of Hong Kong; Sun Yat-sen University; Tsinghua University; University of Science and Technology of China; Wuhan University,Ignition Properties of Panels Coated with Finishing Fire-Retardant Paints under External Radiation,,Coated panels - Coating process - External radiation - Ignition time - Research results - Test platforms,135
Solid State Commun,"The structural, electronic and optical properties of Ce1−xMxO2(M=Fe, Co, Ni; x=0, 0.25) fluorite type oxides are studied by using the method of density functional theory (DFT) + U method. The calculated equilibrium lattice parameter, cell volume, bulk modulus and optical properties for CeO2are in good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. The lattice parameter, cell volume, bulk modulus and bond length of Ce–O decreased after substituting Ce atom with Fe (or Co, Ni). Meanwhile, the band-gap (Eg) reduction is observed. It is interesting to find that doping of Fe (or Co, Ni) in CeO2obviously decreases the O 2p-Ce 4f transition intensity and the covalent character of the Ce–O bond. On the contrary, the static dielectric constant Ε0and refractive index n0for the doped system increased. Compared with the undoped CeO2, the doped system has steep absorption peaks ranging from 1.0 eV to 2.0 eV at lower energy, and it can be used for visible light absorption applications. The Ce0.75Co0.25O2has a high refractive index and reflectivity, therefore it is suitable as a high-refractive index film material in single and multilayered optical coatings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20162802590327,,"Tian, Dong (1, 2); Zeng, Chunhua (1, 2); Fu, Yunchang (2); Wang, Hua (1); Luo, Hongchun (2); Xiang, Chao (3); Wei, Yonggang (1); Li, Kongzhai (1); Zhu, Xing (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Material Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",SSCOA4,482.2 Minerals - 545.1 Iron - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 922.1 Probability Theory - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Bond length - Cerium oxide - Density functional theory - Elastic moduli - Energy gap - Fluorspar - Iron - Lattice constants - Light absorption - Nickel compounds - Optical coatings - Optical lattices - Optical properties - Refractive index - Semiconductor doping,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zeng, Chunhua(zchh2009@126.com) ",10.1016/j.ssc.2016.01.011,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2012HB009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015HB025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014HB006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FB123, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2012FD016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: KKZ3201407030, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51174105, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11305079, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51374004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51204083, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51306084, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 11305079 , 51374004 , 51204083 , 51174105 and 51306084 ), the introduction of talent capital group fund project of Kunming University of Science and Technology (under KKZ3201407030 ), the Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province (Project nos. 2015HB025 , 2014HB006 and 2012HB009 ) and the Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province (Project nos. 2014FB123 and 2012FD016 ).",,00381098,,"April 1, 2016",English,Cobalt compounds,,78.0,68-79,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Solid State Communications,,"A DFT study of the structural, electronic and optical properties of transition metal doped fluorite oxides: Ce0.75M0.25O2(M=Fe, Co, Ni)",,Bond ordering - Dielectric functions - Electronic and optical properties - Fluorite-type oxides - High refractive index - Static dielectric constants - Transition intensity - Visible light absorption,231-232
Microporous Mesoporous Mater.,"Spherical mesoporous silica material (SMSM) was hydrothermally synthesized using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template agent and silica fume as the silica source. High-quality SMSMs were successfully prepared by pseudomorphic transformation. The structure and morphology of the SMSMs are investigated by X-ray diffraction, N2sorption/desorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analyses. The effects of synthetic parameters, such as crystallization time, crystallization temperature, n(NaOH)/n(SiO2) molar ratio, and n(CTAB)/n(SiO2) molar ratio, are quantitatively investigated. The optimal synthetic conditions for high-quality SMSMs are a crystallization time of 48 h, crystallization temperature of 363 K, n(NaOH)/n(SiO2) molar ratio of 0.2-0.3, and n(CTAB)/n(SiO2) molar ratio of 0.15. The qualities of Si-OH are tested by NaOH titration and IR. The results of the both methods confirm that the amount of Si-OH in SMSM is higher than silica fume. Furthermore, SMSMs are employed as effective adsorbents for removing Pb2+from the static, competitive and column experiments. The capacity for Pb2+removal demonstrates great improvement. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Process Biochem.,"An acidic α-galactosidase designated as PCGI was isolated from the fruiting bodies of Pleurotus citrinopileatus with 264-fold purification and a specific activity of 7.92 units/mg. It was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. PCGI is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a 33 kDa and a 27 kDa subunit in SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme was identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. It belongs to the GH27 family. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme with pNPGal as substrate were 4.4 and 50 °C, respectively. Besides, it displayed remarkable resistance to acid protease, neutral protease, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. It was strongly inhibited by Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Al3+, Fe3+and Ag+ions. Diethypyrocarbonate (DEPC) doubled the activity of PCGI whereas N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) drastically decreased it. PCGI displayed wide substrate diversity with activity toward substrates such as stachyose, raffinose, melibiose. The Km values for hydrolysis of pNPGal, stachyose, raffinose, and melibiose were 0.2, 16.7, 18.9, and 6.3 mM, respectively. Galactose (Ki = 0.92 mM) and melibiose (Ki = 7.13 mM) competitively inhibited the enzymes. Futhermore, it completely degraded raffinose and sthachyose. These results suggest that PCGI has great potential for removal of the non-digestible and flatulence-causing oligosaccharides stachyose and raffinose from legumes. © 2016 The Authors.

Earth Sci. Front.,"Based on the latest drilling data, the laboratory test results of shale core samples from Well Maye-1 and combined with the geologic survey of field outcrops, this paper systematically studies the reservoir characteristics of the Lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi shale in the Malong block of eastern Yunnan Province from organic geochemical characteristics, mineral constituents, reservoir properties and fracture characteristics. The Qiongzhusi shale of study area is characterized by high organic content with TOC over 2%. The black shale was all high-over mature because of the old Qiongzhusi Formation. The major mineralogical compositions of shale are detrital minerals, carbonatite minerals and clay minerals. The black shale has a high brittleness mineral content and the brittleness index averages at 0.62. Clay minerals are mainly composed of illite, followed by the I/S layers and chlorite, and the kaolinite content is low. Qiongzhusi shale is characterized by low porosity and permeability and various pore types dominated by inkbottle-shaped pores, plate-like pores and slit-shaped pores. Nanoscale mesopores in shale play an important role. The specific surface area and total pore volume are low with an average of 9.18 m2/g and 10.38×10-3cm3/g, respectively. The fissures of shale reservoir are mainly of high angle crack. Carbonaceous shale in the upper part of target layer is characterized by well-developed fissures and silty shale in the lower part of target layer possesses undeveloped fissures. TOC and brittle minerals contents promote the development of fissures. Compared with typical marine shale from home and abroad, the shale from Qiongzhusi Formation in the Malong block of eastern Yunnan Province is mainly composed of silty shale with some thin carbonaceous shale. Barnett shale from Fort Worth, Longmaxi shale from Jiaoshiba area and Niutitang shale from Cen'gong block are mainly carbonaceous and siliceous shale. So the lithofacies of Qiongzhusi shale is poorer than that of the other three kinds of marine shale. The TOC content of Qiongzhusi shale is moderate, lower than that of the other three kinds of marine shale. The brittleness minerals content of Qiongzhusi shale is similar to that of Longmaxi shale and slightly lower than that of Niutitang shale. Qiongzhusi shale is characterized by good brittleness. The reservoir property and development of organic matter pores of Barnett shale and Longmaxi shale are better than those of Qiongzhusi shale and Niutitang shale. The organic matter pores in Qiongzhusi shale mainly develop in the mixture of organic matter and clay. The fissure development of Qiongzhusi shale is poorer than that of Barnett shale, Longmaxi shale and Niutitang shale. In addition, the gas content of Qiongzhusi shale is lower than that of other three kinds of marine shale, and Qiongzhusi shale has a strong adsorption ability. © 2016, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

Opt. Mater. Express,"The SiO2: Tb, Yb thin films (or inverse opals) including Ag nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully synthesized by using the sol-gel method. The influence of Ag species on the photoluminescence (PL) property of SiO2: Tb, Yb, Ag material was investigated. Under 250 nm excitation, the visible-infrared (NIR) quantum cutting (QC) emission from Tb3+and Yb3+are greatly enhanced with formation of Ag NPs in SiO2thin films. Meanwhile, an interesting broad excitation band which may be attributed to Ag nanoclusters of (Ag4)2+tetramers is obtained by monitoring 977 nm emission of Yb3+. It is supposed that the (Ag4)2+can pass energy to Yb3+directly, where the energy transfer (ET) between (Ag4)2+to the Yb3+is suggested in a QC process. Moreover, we demonstrated that the Tb ions are required for the formation of the (Ag4)2+in SiO2glass hosts. In the SiO2: Tb, Yb, Ag inverse opals thin films, the QC emission intensity of Yb3+is considerably improved by inhibiting the blue and green emission of Tb3+. The results demonstrated that the ET between Tb3+and Yb3+is enhanced. In addition, we not only observed the existence of (Ag4)2+, but also obtained ET from silver aggregates of (Ag2)+to Tb3+in the inverse opals under 377 nm excitation.

By adopting the transient melt fraction by mass during melting as a means for comparison, a parametric study was conducted on the mass fraction of graphite nanoplatelets as well as the isothermal heating boundary condition. Results show that the melting heat transfer of the composite PCM experiences a transition from convection-dominated to conduction-dominated with the mass fraction increasing. And within the studied cases, although the thermal conductivity of the composite PCM is enhanced to some extent, such enhancement is not sufficient to compensate the loss of natural convection due to the increased viscosity but to slow down the melting process. An experimental correlation for the melt fraction was proposed in terms of the characteristic dimensionless groupings, such as the Fourier, Stefan and Grashof numbers, with predictive deviation less than 15%. © 2016, Zhejiang University Press.

Laser Phys.,"In order to get a γ-laser by the backscattering of electron-photons in a wiggle magnetic field, the length of an effective backscattering region is postulated to be small enough. The paper demonstrates that the condition is only a sufficient one; it is not a necessary condition. The necessary condition is given. The backscattering of electron-photons in a wiggle magnetic field can produce a γ-laser. It is possible that the amplitude of the γ-laser is small. The amplitude can be significantly increased by increasing the magnetic induction of the wiggle magnetic field, by reducing the wavelength of the wiggle magnetic field, and by making the monochromaticity of an incident electron beam better. In a laser standing wave field or a superposition field of a wiggle magnetic field and a laser standing wave field, the backscattering of electron-photons can produce a quasi-laser with a shorter wavelength. © 2016 Astro Ltd.",,20160801972229,25807.0,"Chen, Shi-Hao (1, 2); Chen, Ziwei (3) ","(1) Institute of Theoretical Physics, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin Province; 130024, China (2) Yue-Hong Institute for Advanced Study, Yunnan University, Yunnan; 650091, China (3) Key Laboratory of Microwave and Electromagnetic Radiation, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing; 100190, China ",,"701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 744.1 Lasers, General - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,,Backscattering - Elastic waves - Electron beams - Lasers - Magnetic fields - Photons,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1088/1054-660X/26/2/025807,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15556611,"Number: 11075064, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The work is supported by tau-charm physics research KJ(x2-yw-N29) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China 11075064.,,1054660X,2,February 2016,English,Electrons,,5.0,,,2016,Institute of Physics Publishing,Laser Physics,,Coherent conditions of electron-photon backscattering light in a wiggle magnetic field,,Electron backscattering - Incident electron beams - Laser standing wave field - Laser standing waves - Monochromaticity - Photon back-scattering - Shorter wavelength,26
Dianzi Yu Xinxi Xuebao,"In entropy coding systems based on the context modeling, the 'context dilution' problem introduced by high-order context models needs to be alleviated by the context quantization to achieve the desired compression gain. Therefore, an algorithm is proposed to implement the Context Quantization by the Minimizing Description Length (MDLCQ) in this paper. With the description length as the evaluation criterion, the Context Quantization Of Single-Condition (CQOSC) is attained by the dynamic programming algorithm. Then the context quantizer of multi-conditions can be designed by the iterated application of CQOSC. This algorithm can not only design the optimized context quantizer for multi-valued sources, but also determine adaptively the importance of every condition so as to design the best order of the model. The experimental results show that the context quantizer designed by the MDLCQ algorithm can apparently improve the compression performance of the entropy coding system. © 2016, Science Press.

J. Geochem. Explor.,"The Pulang ore deposit, one of the largest porphyry copper deposits in China, is located in the Yidun continental arc, SW China. The alteration zones in the deposit transit upward and outward from early potassium-silicate, through quartz-sericite, to later propylitization. The wallrock near the porphyry stock was mostly changed into hornfels. The former two alterations host the main orebodies, constituting the core of mineralized zone; the later two alterations only develop weak mineralization surrounding the core. In this paper, various fractal indices, including the exponent of lacunarity, multifractal spectrum, correlation dimension and Hurst exponent, are applied to characterize the Cu spatial distribution in 114 drillcores in the Pulang ore deposit, with the aim to correlate the element spatial pattern with its dynamic drive. Compared to fractal indices in the propylitic zone and hornfels, the exponents of lacunarity in the potassium-silicate and quartz-sericite zones exhibit lower and more stable values, the correlation dimensions are higher and more consistent; yet the values of height difference of multifractal spectrum are lower and largely varied, and the Hurst exponents show little difference. Variations of the former three indices suggest that the core of mineralized zone has more homogeneity, stronger compactness of high concentrations, and greater proportion of high concentrations in the Cu distribution compared to the other parts of the deposit. More importantly, the correlation dimension, indicating the complexity of controls underpinning the system, is closely correlated to the exponent of lacunarity, which represents the homogeneity of spatial pattern. This correlation between those two indices implies a genetic link, that is to say the greater complexity of controls results in a more homogeneous spatial distribution of Cu in the porphyry deposit. The stability of the two indices is considered to reflect the development of thick orebody, providing a new perspective to understand the genesis of porphyry ore deposit. This interpretation from the fractal perspective is consistent with the geological understanding for the formation of porphyry deposits, which is considered to be subject to the complexity of ore fluid evolution with multifaceted physicochemical conditions. For a pragmatic use, these two fractal indices are successfully applied in the delineation of the core of mineralized zone in the plane view. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20153001061852,,"Liu, Huan (1); Wang, Qingfei (2); Zhang, Changqing (1); Lou, Debo (1); Zhou, Yunman (3); He, Zhonghua (3) ","(1) MLR Key Laboratory of Metallogeny and Mineral Assessment, Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing; 100037, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing; 100083, China (3) Yunnan Gold and Mineral Group Co., Ltd, Kunming; 650224, China ",,481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 482.2 Minerals - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Deposits - Economic geology - Fractal dimension - Mineralogy - Ores - Potassium compounds - Quartz - Silicates - Spatial distribution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Qingfei(wqf@cugb.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.gexplo.2015.07.001,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2015CB452600, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB440903, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2009CB421008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Lowell Institute for Mineral Resources; Number: K1411, Acronym: CAAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Number: 12120113093700, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: E1107, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 41172295, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We appreciate the valuable comments and careful revisions from two anonymous reviews and John Carranza.

Rare Met.,"The solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique applied to the extraction of organic compound was creatively used as the extraction of inorganic gold in the paper. Two types of techniques were proposed and explored, namely the SPE and the liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) of the quaternary ammonium surfactant [cetytrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTMAB), cetyl pyridine bromide (CPB), benzyl dimethyl dodecyl ammonium chloride (BDMDAC), and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DTMAC)]. The surfactant could react with Au(CN)2−to form the ionic complex, and the compound could be extracted by SPE column of reversed-phase bonded silica gel. Hence, a new method of SPE was proposed to extract gold with these features of the high selectivity, the reliability, and the simplicity. The experimental result shows that the recovery rate of gold is more than 98 %, and the solid-phase extraction column is not easily damaged and it can be repeatedly used. The new method can be used as the extraction process of gold from alkaline cyanide solution as well. Besides, the paper also puts forward a new process of gold extraction. © 2014, The Author(s).",Open Access,20143600016680,,"Xie, Run-Fang (1); Hu, Qiu-Fen (2); Yang, Guang-Yu (2); Chen, Jing (2); Han, Yun-Shan (3); Zhao, Yong-He (1); Li, Zhen (1) ","(1) School of Forensic Medicine, Kunming Medical University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Inspection and Analysis Center, Yunnan Copper Industry Limited by Share Ltd, Kunming; 650102, China ",RARME8,547.1 Precious Metals - 601.3 Mechanisms - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Chlorine compounds - Cyanides - Gold - Mechanisms - Phase separation - Silica - Silica gel - Surface active agents,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhen ",10.1007/s12598-014-0323-2,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18677185,,,,10010521,3,"March 1, 2016",English,Extraction,,28.0,282-288,,2016,University of Science and Technology Beijing,Rare Metals,,Solid-phase extraction gold from alkaline cyanide solution with quaternary ammonium surfactant,,Alkaline cyanide solution - Ammonium bromides - Dodecyl ammonium chlorides - Extraction process - Quaternary ammonium surfactants - Solid phase extraction techniques - Solid-phase extraction - Solid-phase extraction columns,35

J Mol Liq,"The inclusion complexes of trans-polydatin (PD) with β-CD and γ-CD were prepared. The inclusion complexation behavior, characterization and interactions of PD with CDs were investigated in both the solution and the solid state by means of UV-vis, ESI-MS, NMR, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TG and DSC. All of the characterization information demonstrated the formation of PD/CDs inclusion complex, and the PD/CDs inclusion complexes exhibited different spectroscopic features and properties from PD. The 1:1 stoichiometry of the complexes was visually proven with the ESI-MS experiment and Job's method. Meanwhile, it was the phenyl group (a and b rings) of the PD molecule that were included in the CDs cavity from the wide side. Moreover, the water solubility of PD/CDs was significantly improved from 0.161 mg/mL to 7.21 mg/mL (PD/β-CD) and 12.02 mg/mL (PD/γ-CD).

The conductivities of lead - MSA solutions have been measured and modeled to characterize the electrorefining medium. The effects of current density, electrode spacing, electrorefining temperature, lead concentration, free-MSA concentration and electrorefining time on the electrorefining process were investigated. The cell voltage and specific energy consumption of the electrorefining process increase with an increase of current density, electrode spacing and electrorefining time, and decrease with an increase of electrorefining temperature, lead concentration and free-MSA concentration. The operating parameters of the electrorefining process for production of pure lead from MSA medium in this study have a widely acceptable range as follows: current density 150–250 A/m2, electrode spacing 3.0–6.0 cm, electrorefining temperature 293.5–313.5 K, lead concentration 60–150 g/L and a free-MSA concentration 100 g/L. The cathodic current efficiency was in excess of 99% and the specific energy consumption was below 110 kW h/t-Pb.

Nonlinear Anal Theory Methods Appl,"The isentropic relativistic Euler equations for polytropic gas under flux perturbations are studied. The Riemann problem of the pressureless relativistic Euler equations with a flux approximation is firstly solved, and a family of delta-shock and U-shaped pseudo-vacuum state solutions are constructed. Then it is shown that, as the flux approximation vanishes, the limits of the family of delta-shock and U-shaped pseudo-vacuum solutions are exactly the delta-shock and vacuum state solutions to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, respectively. Secondly, we study the Riemann problem of the isentropic relativistic Euler equations with a double parameter flux approximation including pressure term. We further prove that, as the pressure and two-parameter flux perturbation vanish, respectively, any two-shock Riemann solution tends to a delta-shock solution to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, and the intermediate density between the two shocks tends to a weighted δ-measure which forms a delta shock wave; any two-rarefaction Riemann solution tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the pressureless relativistic Euler equations, and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J Vib Shock,"To prevent the leakage accidents of pipes and boiler, the key technique lies in whether the signals of cracks and small leaks can be detected effectively. Aiming at this, a new method of detecting acoustic emission signals based on RQA and SVM was described. The theory of wavelet threshold de-noising was used to reduce the noise signal. The principle of RQA was borrowed to detect acoustic emission signals and by calculation, some quantifiable feature parameters were obtained. Using these parameters as the SVM input parameters, the simulated acoustic emission signals of cracks were identified. By experiments, the feasibility of the method was validated. © 2016, Chinese Vibration Engineering Society.

Vacuum,"([Formula presented])-HA biocomposites with different HA contents were fabricated by sparkle plasma sintering. The structure, mechanical and corrosion properties of these biocomposites were investigated. The results indicated that the addition of HA to TNZ lead to impede the phase transformation from α-Ti to β-Ti, and produce reaction products which affected the properties. There is a linear relationship (ρr=99.298−0.125Wp) between relative density of biocomposites and HA concentration. The biocomposites exhibited excellent mechanical strength, ensuring better behaviour as implant material. Elastic modulus tests showed that the biocomposites which approximated to that of natural bones were much lower than Ti (or Ti alloys)-HA composites and [Formula presented]. Biocomposites with 10% of HA performed an optimal corrosion resistant in simulated artificial body fluid. An increase in HA content decreased corrosion resistant owing to the surface micropores and defects induced by reactions between particles and ceramic particle detachment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20162702560936,,"He, Y.H.

Cluster Comput.,"As a popular data management and computation tool, ontology is widely used in material science, biological genetics, chemistry, biology and pharmaceuticals. It can be regarded as a dictionary or a database, and the key of various ontology applications is similarity measuring between concepts in ontology. In this paper, we propose a new ontology learning algorithm for ontology similarity measuring and ontology mapping by means of singular value decomposition method and deterministic sampling iteration. Then, the new ontology learning is applied in plant science, gene biology, bionics and physics ontologies.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"With the increase of the number of online services, it is more and more difficult for customers to make the decision on service selection. Services ranking mechanism is an important service for e-commerce that facilitates consumers’ decision-making process. Traditional services ranking methods ignore the fact that customers cannot rate services under the same criteria, which leads to the ratings are actually incomparable. In this paper, we propose to exploit the ordinal preferences rather than cardinal ratings to rank online services. Ordinal preferences are elicited from filled ratings so that the intensity of ratings is ignored. We construct a directed graph to depict the set of pairwise preferences between services. Then, the strongest paths of the directed graph are identified and the evaluation values of services are calculated based on the strongest paths. We prove our method satisfies some important conditions that a reasonable services ranking method should satisfy. Experiments using real data of movie ratings demonstrate that the proposed method is advantageous over previous methods, and so the proposed method can rank services effectively even the ratings are given by customers with inconsistent criteria. In addition, the experiments also verify that it is more difficult to manipulate the ranking result of our method than existing methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,20164803051859,,"Chen, Ying (1); Fu, Xiao-Dong (1, 2); Yue, Kun (3); Liu, Li (1, 2); Liu, Li-Jun (1, 2) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Application, Kunming; Yunnan, China (3) Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,"912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",185699.0,"June 3, 2016 - June 5, 2016","Nanchang, China","17th International Conference on Web-Age Information Management, WAIM 2016",Decision making - Information management - Sales,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fu, Xiao-Dong(xiaodong_fu@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-47121-1_4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 2014FB133, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61462051, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81560296, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472345, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61462056, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grand 61462056, 61472345, 61462051, 81560296), the Applied Fundamental Research Project of Yunnan Province (Grand No. 2014FA028, 2014FA023, 2014FB133).",9783319471204.0,03029743,,2016,English,Directed graphs,"Web-Age Information Management - WAIM 2016 International Workshops MWDA, SDMMW, and SemiBDMA, Revised Selected Papers",15.0,41-53,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Ranking online services by aggregating ordinal preferences,,Decision making process - Inconsistent rating criteria - Manipulation - On-line service - Ordinal preference - Ranking mechanisms - Service selection - Traditional services,9998 LNCS
J. Clim.,"The interannual zonal movement of the interface between the Indian summer monsoon and the East Asian summer monsoon (IIE), associated with the spring sea surface temperature (SST) seesaw mode (SSTSM) over the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) and the tropical central-western Pacific (TCWP), is studied for the period 1979-2008. The observational analysis is based on Twentieth Century Reanalysis data (version 2) of atmospheric circulations, Extended Reconstructed SST data (version 3), and the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation. The results indicate that the IIE's zonal movement is significantly and persistently correlated with the TIO-TCWP SSTSM, from spring to summer. The results of two case studies resemble those obtained by regression analysis. Experiments using an atmospheric general circulation model (ECHAM6) substantiate the key physical processes revealed in the observational analysis. When warmer (colder) SSTs appear in the TIO and colder (warmer) SSTs occur in the TCWP, the positive (negative) SSTSM forces anomalous easterly (westerly) winds over the Bay of Bengal (BOB), South China Sea (SCS), and western North Pacific (WNP). The anomalous easterly (westerly) winds further result in a weakened (strengthened) southwest summer monsoon over the BOB and a strengthened (weakened) southeast summer monsoon over the SCS and WNP. This causes the IIE to shift farther eastward (westward) than normal. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.",,20162802589297,,"Cao, Jie (1, 2); Gui, Shu (1); Su, Qin (1); Yang, Yali (1) ","(1) Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory of International Rivers and Transboundary Eco-security, Kunming, China ",,"443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444.1 Surface Water - 471.1 Oceanography, General - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Atmospheric temperature - Atmospheric thermodynamics - Climatology - Regression analysis - Submarine geophysics - Surface properties - Surface waters,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cao, Jie(caoj@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0839.1,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 41375097, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1502233, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41305078, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1502233, 41375097, and 41305078).",,08948755,13,2016,English,Oceanography,,39.0,5027-5040,,2016,American Meteorological Society,Journal of Climate,,The variability of the Indian-East Asian summer monsoon interface in relation to the spring seesaw mode between the Indian Ocean and the central-western Pacific,,Atmospheric circulation - Atmospheric general circulation models - Climate prediction centers - East Asian summer monsoon - Monsoons - Observational analysis - Sea surface temperature (SST) - Western North Pacific,29

Neiranji Xuebao,"Based on the calibrated one-dimensional thermodynamic simulation model constructed by GT-Power, a comparative simulation on the performance of a common-rail heavy-duty(HD)diesel engine equipped with two-stage turbocharger(2, TC)and one-stage turbocharger(1, TC), was conducted at different altitudes(0, 2, 4, km). Results showed that, the efficiency of 1, TC compressor decreases under high load and low speed condition, while the efficiency of 2, TC low-pressure stage compressor increases under low speed condition with the increased altitude. The efficiency of 2, TC high-pressure stage compressor increases and then decreases with the increase of engine speed, and it significantly decreases under high speed condition at 0 altitude. Exhaust energy loss rate for the 2, TC decreases significantly, but heat transfer and friction loss rates increase under low speed condition at high altitude compared with those of 1, TC. Meanwhile, the pumping loss is higher than that of 1, TC with the increase of engine speed. The efficiency of 1, TC compressor increases and then decreases with the increase of EGR rate and it decreases with the increase of altitude. The efficiency of 2, TC low-pressure stage compressor decreases rapidly as EGR rate is increased, and the efficiency of high-pressure stage compressor increases and then decreases with the increase of altitude at low EGR rate. With the increase of EGR rate, compared with 1, TC, heat transfer loss rate for the 2, TC increases gradually, but it significantly decreases the exhaust loss and improves the NOx-BSFC trade-off relationship at high altitudes. © 2016, Editorial Office of the Transaction of CSICE.

"Conf. North Am. Chapter Assoc. Comput. Linguist.: Hum. Lang. Technol., NAACL HLT - Proc.

Compared to the categorical approach that represents affective states as several classes (e.g., positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. However, affective resources with valence-arousal ratings are still very rare, especially for the Chinese language. Therefore, this study builds 1) an affective lexicon called Chinese valence-arousal words (CVAW) containing 1,653 words, and 2) an affective corpus called Chinese valence-arousal text (CVAT) containing 2,009 sentences extracted from web texts.

J. Vinyl Addit. Technol.,"The effect of the reaction media on clay dispersion and mechanical properties in poly(butylene succinate) (PBS, a biodegradable aliphatic thermoplastic polyester)/organoclay nanocomposites was investigated in this article. The results suggested that the most dispersed structures can be observed for organoclay modified in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), which was used as solvent in the modification of montmorillonite in this study known for its environmentally benign, inexpensive, and nonflammable solvent, high diffusivity like a gas, near-zero surface tension, low viscosity and density like a liquid, and high-solvency power tunable by adjusting pressure and then organoclay modified in ethanol, while the least for organoclay was modified in distilled water. The results also confirmed intercalation-predominate structures were obtained for nanocomposites of PBS with organoclay modified in ethanol, the mixture of intercalated and exfoliated structures for nanocomposites of PBS with organoclay modified in distilled water, but when clay was modified in scCO2, exfoliation-predominate structures were observed for the nanocomposites. The storage modulus was significantly enhanced below the glass transition temperature, and the glass transition temperature shifted to a higher temperature compared with pure PBS and the maximum for PBS-based nanocomposite of pretreated grafted montmorillonite via modification with trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride in scCO2(OGMMTc). The mechanical properties including tensile strength and notched impact strength first decreased and then increased, whereas flexural strength and flexural modulus steadily and nearly linearly increased, maximum for PBS/OGMMTc nanocomposite, owing to the strong interaction between matrix and clay, which ultimately led to better overall dispersion.

Mater Chem Phys,"In the present work, the crystal structure, transforming property, magnetocaloric and negative thermal expansion effects were investigated in polycrystalline Ni55.5Mn19.5Ga25alloy, respectively. The structure measurement indicates that it possesses unmodulated martensitic structure (L10) at room temperature. Here, the present alloy shows a first-order magneto-structural transformation from paramagnetic (PM) austenite to ferromagnetic (FM) martensite on cooling. Benefiting from this transformation, a considerable refrigerant capacity (RC) with a value of about 55 J/kg K was obtained around room temperature for the magnetic field change of 3 T. Moreover, the unique negative thermal expansion (NTE) effect was observed not only for the transforming range, but also for the pure martensitic state of the studied alloy. As distinct from a large NTE effect caused by magneto-structural transformation, such an effect at martensite is not accompanied by any thermal hysteresis, performing an excellently linear feature with a coefficient over 8 × 10−6/K within a broad temperature range (from 250 K to 50 K). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162302475446,,"Li, Zhe (1); Yang, Huimin (1); Xu, Kun (1); Zhang, Yuanlei (1, 2); Zheng, Dong (2); Jing, Chao (2) ","(1) Center for Magnetic Materials and Devices & Key Laboratory for Advanced Functional and Low Dimensional Materials of Yunnan Higher Education Institute, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; 655011, China (2) Department of Physics, Shanghai University, Shanghai; 200444, China ",MCHPDR,"531.2 Metallography - 543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Buoyancy - Crystal structure - Expansion - Gallium alloys - Linear transformations - Magnetocaloric effects - Manganese alloys - Martensite - Martensitic transformations - Mathematical transformations - Negative thermal expansion - Polycrystalline materials - Ternary alloys,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhe(zheli@shu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2016.05.056,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 13JC1402400, Acronym: STCSM, Sponsor: Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; Number: TD201301, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013FZ110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 551371111, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11404186, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 1136403, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 1136403 , 11404186 and 551371111 ), the Key Basic Research Program of Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (No. 13JC1402400 ), and Project for Innovative Research Team of Qujing Normal University (Grant No. TD201301 ), and Project for Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2013FZ110 ).",,02540584,,"September 1, 2016",English,Thermal expansion,,25.0,156-160,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Materials Chemistry and Physics,,Magnetocaloric and negative thermal expansion effects for Ni55.5Mn19.5Ga25Heusler alloy with magneto-structural transition,,Broad temperature ranges - First-order magneto-structural transformations - Heusler alloys - Martensitic structures - Refrigerant capacity - Structural transformation - Structural transitions - Structure measurement,180

Shipin Kexue/Food Sc.,"Moringa oleifera, belonging to the Moringaceae family, is a biennial deciduous tree that is distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant has been introduced into China and planted in Guangdong, Yunnan and Taiwan provinces. Moringa oleifera is called as 'Miracle Tree' due to its rapid growth. Both its leaves and tender fruits are edible. Moringa oleifera seeds contain more than 30% oil. Moringa oleifera seed proteins are traditionally utilized for water purification owing to advantages such as natural occurrence, no toxic or side effects and easy degradation. Furthermore, Moringa oleifera contains carbamate derivatives and phenolic compounds, which show a diversity of biological activities including antifungal, anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic effects.

Eur. Phys. J. B,"Entropic stochastic resonance is investigated when a self-propelled Janus particle moves in a double-cavity container. Numerical simulation results indicate the entropic stochastic resonance can survive even if there is no symmetry breaking in any direction. This is the essential distinction between the property of a self-propelled Janus particle and that of a passive Brownian particle, for the symmetry breaking is necessary for the entropic stochastic resonance of a passive Brownian particle. With the rotational noise intensity growing at small fixed noise intensity of translational motion, the signal power amplification increases monotonically towards saturation which also can be regarded as a kind of stochastic resonance effect. Besides, the increase in the natural frequency of the periodic driving depresses the degree of the stochastic resonance, whereas the rise in its amplitude enhances and then suppresses the behavior. © 2016, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20164202904190,222,"Liu, Zhenzhen (1); Du, Luchun (1); Guo, Wei (2); Mei, Dong-Cheng (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Kunming University, Kunming; 650214, China ",,701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 703.1 Electric Networks - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Brownian movement - Circuit resonance - Magnetic resonance - Statistical Physics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Du, Luchun(lcdu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1140/epjb/e2016-70453-3,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14346036,,,,14346028,10,"October 1, 2016",English,Stochastic systems,,32.0,,,2016,Springer Heidelberg,European Physical Journal B,,Entropic stochastic resonance of a self-propelled Janus particle,,Brownian particles - Janus particles - Noise intensities - Signal power amplification - Statistical and Nonlinear Physics - Stochastic resonances - Symmetry-breaking - Translational motions,89

Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue,"A new method, Numerical Source Apportionment (NSA) approach,was proposed based on the widely applied water quality model, The Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC), to get the source component of pollutants, theoretically for any location of the lake at any time. The main idea behind was to take partial derivative of water quality equation with respect to each polluting source. After that, a set of partial differential equations were derived from one water quality partial differential equation. These equations were then solved together with hydrodynamic model in EFDC. As a result, by running model only one time, the contribution of each polluting source at each spatial and temporal point could be achieved. Generalized Lake Fuxian model was taken to validate NSA. Source apportionment results of NSA are coordinate with traditional perturbation method, which validated NSA method. On the other hand, for there were 34independent polluting source in numerical case study, to get source apportionment results traditional perturbation method had to run model for 35 times while NSA only required one time which indicated NSA has obvious advantage on computation efficiency. Further analysis showed NSA could provide more precise description on the dynamic of source apportionment. © 2016, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

Opt Eng,"The evolution properties and the spectral degree of coherence of a partially coherent multi-Gaussian Schell-model vortex (MGSMv) beam propagating in uniaxial crystals orthogonal to the optical axis are studied. Propagation expression for the cross-spectral density and the average intensity of the partially coherent MGSMv beam propagating in uniaxial crystals are derived. Some analyses are illustrated by numerical examples related to the propagation properties and coherence vortices of the partially coherent MGSMv beam in uniaxial crystals. Numerical results show that, upon propagating in uniaxial crystals, the partially coherent MGSMv beam loses its initial dark center distribution. After propagating for sufficient distances, the partially coherent MGSMv beam will also evolve into a flat-topped beam. The evolution behavior of average intensity and coherent vortices depends on the crystal including the ratio of extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices, and beam parameters including the spatial correlation length and topological charge of the beams, as well as the propagation distance. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",,20164703038958,116101,"Liu, Huilong (1, 2); Chen, Dong (1, 2); Xia, Jing (1, 2); Lü, Yanfei (1, 2); Zhang, Li (1, 2); Pu, Xiaoyun (1, 2) ","(1) Yunnan University, School of Physical Science and Technology, 2 Cuihu North Road, Wuhua District, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Yunnan University, Department of Astronomy, Key Laboratory of Astroparticle Physics of Yunnan Province, 2 Cuihu North Road, Wuhua District, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",OPEGAR,"631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.1 Light/Optics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements",,,,,Coherent light - Gaussian distribution - Laser optics - Light measurement - Numerical methods - Refractive index - Spectral density - Vortex flow,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lü, Yanfei(optik@sina.com) ",10.1117/1.OE.55.11.116101,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15602303,"Number: 61475026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61275135, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61108029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61475026, 61275135, and 61108029).",,00913286,11,"November 1, 2016",English,Gaussian beams,,41.0,,,2016,SPIE,Optical Engineering,,Influences of uniaxial crystal on partially coherent multi-Gaussian Schell-model vortex beams,,Cross spectral densities - Gaussian Schell model - Propagation distances - Propagation properties - Spatial correlations - Spectral degree - Uniaxial crystal - Vortex beams,55
Appl Comput Electromagn Soc J,"In this paper, loop basis functions are introduced to expand the magnetic flux density and the magnetostatic subset of Maxwell's equations are solved in a compact and straightforward manner using finite element method. As linear combinations of divconforming Schaubert-Wilton-Glisson basis functions in three-dimensional, loop basis functions are inherently divergence-free and originally constructed to represent solenoidal electric current density in the electric field integral equation. Sharing the same physical property with the solenoidal electric current density, the magnetic flux density can also be represented by the loop basis functions and thus, Gauss' law for magnetism is naturally satisfied; which is out of the capability of general Whitney elements.

Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"With the popularity of mobile intelligent terminal, user comments of App software is viewed as one of the research interests of social computing. Faced with the massive App software, most users usually view the other users’ comments and marks to selecting the desired App software. Due to the freedom and randomness of the network comments, the inconsistence between the user’s comment and mark makes it difficult to choose App software. This paper presents a method by analyzing the relationships among user’s comment information, the user’s mark and App software information. Firstly, the consistency between user’s comment information and App software information is judged.

RSC Adv.,"A composite adsorbent (Fe-activated carbon) was synthesized by impregnating Fe(NO3)3onto activated carbon, and heated via microwave heating to remove methylene blue (MB), utilizing ultrasound-microwave combined preparation methods. The optimal MB removal capacity and yield of Fe-activated carbon is 257 mg g-1and 83.31%, respectively, under optimal conditions such as 700 W of microwave power, 700 °C of temperature and 25 min of heating time. The ultrasound was used for assisted-impregnation of Fe(NO3)3onto the activated carbon via its acoustic cavitation. The removal capacity on MB of Fe-activated carbon increases by 17.12%, as compared to that of it without ultrasound assisted-impregnation. The physico-chemical properties of Fe-activated carbon were examined by XRD, XPS, SEM, EDX, FTIR, Raman and N2adsorption. Moreover, the existence of Fe3O4leads to Fe-activated carbon having magnetic properties, which makes it easily separable from dyes wastewater in an external magnetic field. The equilibrium adsorption data showed that the adsorption behavior followed the Langmuir isotherm, and a pseudo-second order model matched well the kinetic data. Compared with raw activated carbon, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of Fe-activated carbon increases by 25.96%. According to these results, Fe-activated carbon is a promising adsorbent for the removal of dye from wastewater. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20163602775414,,"Cheng, Song (1, 2, 3, 4); Zhang, Libo (1, 2, 3, 4); Xia, Hongying (1, 2, 3, 4); Peng, Jinhui (1, 2, 3, 4); Shu, Jianhua (1, 2, 3, 4); Li, Chunyang (1, 2, 3, 4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Natl.

Int. J. Climatol.,"This paper investigates the interannual variability of precipitation over the South Asian monsoonal region in May, during which the South Asian summer monsoon is generally established. The South Asian monsoonal region in this study is referred to as a broad area that includes the Arabian Sea, the Indian peninsula, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indochina peninsula. The precipitation exhibits a significant enhancement in May, compared to that in the previous month. The present results indicate that the interannual variability of May precipitation in this region is significantly regulated by two independent factors: The Europe-West Asia (EWA) teleconnection and El Niño Southern Oscillation. The EWA teleconnection pattern is characterized by the see-saw pattern of upper-tropospheric geopotential height anomalies between the Europe and the Iranian plateau. Both the factors modulate the meridional gradient of tropospheric temperature and lower-tropospheric zonal winds, and thus affect the rainfall in the monsoonal region. Therefore, both the extratropical circulation teleconnection and tropical forcing are crucial for inducing rainfall variability in May over the monsoonal region. © 2016 Royal Meteorological Society.",,20153501211568,,"Deng, Mengyu (1, 2, 3, 4); Lu, Riyu (1); Chen, Wei (1); Cao, Jie (3, 5) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (2) Institute of Plateau Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Chengdu, China (3) Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (4) Heavy Rain and Drought-Flood Disasters in Plateau and Basin Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, China (5) Yunnan Key Laboratory of International Rivers and Transboundary Eco-security, Kunming, China ",IJCLEU,443 Meteorology,,,,,Atmospheric pressure - Climatology - Rain,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Wei(chenwei@mail.iap.ac.cn) ",10.1002/joc.4454,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10970088,"Number: 41375097, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41320104007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41105046, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank Dr Takeshi Watanabe in Tokai University, Japan, for providing the time series of the monsoon onset dates over Kerala, India.

Anal. Methods,"A rapid, ultrasensitive, and practical label-free electrochemical immunoassay for measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) in real serum samples was developed. Molybdenum disulfide-polyaniline-gold nanoparticles (MoS2-PANI-GNPs) with high conductivity were employed as the substrate to assist the electron transfer. Compared with a bare electrode, an about 10-fold increase in the peak current could be detected for MoS2-PANI-GNPs. Moreover, MoS2-PANI-GNPs which have abundant adsorbing sites and a large surface area could greatly increase loading amounts of antibodies and thus, significantly improve the performance of biosensing. Under optimized experimental conditions, the proposed sensing strategy provides a linear dynamic range from 0.2 to 80 ng mL-1and a detection limit of 40 pg mL-1. The proposed immunosensor has also been used to determine CRP in human serum with satisfactory results.

"Pac. Asia Conf. Inf. Syst., PACIS - Proc.","With the rapid development of Internet, especially the social media technologies, the public have gradually published their perception of social events online through social media. In Web2.0 era, with the concept of extensive participation of public in social-event-related information sharing, the effective content analysis and better results presentation for these media published online thus possesses significant importance for public opinion analysis and monitoring. In view of this, this paper proposes a novel method for public opinion analysis on social media website. First, the probabilistic topic model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is adopted to extract the public ideas about the distinct topics of certain event, and then the deep learning model named word2vec is used to calculate the emotional intensity for each text. Next, the underlying themes in the whole as well as the events of emotional intensity are investigated, and the variation trend of public's emotion intensities is tracked based on time series analysis.

Metall Mat Trans A Phys Metall Mat Sci,"In this work, new experimental vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) data of lead-antimony alloy (Pb-Sb alloy) in vacuum distillation are reported. The activity coefficients of components of Pb-Sb alloy were calculated by using the NRTL model. The calculated average relative deviations were ±0.1425 and ±0.2433 pct, and the average standard deviations were ±0.0009 and ±0.0007, respectively, for Pb and Sb. The VLE phase diagrams, such as the temperature composition (T-x) and pressure composition (P-x) diagrams of Pb-Sb alloy in vacuum distillation were predicted based on the NRTL model and VLE theory. The predicted results are consistent with the new experimental data indicating that VLE phase diagrams obtained by this method are reliable. The VLE phase diagrams of alloys will provide an effective and intuitive way for the technical design and realization of recycling and separation processes.

Gaodianya Jishu,"A method for identifying the material of transformer winding is studied, which can be used to detect whether the transformer is aluminum or copper. This method can avoid the potential safety hazard and economic loss to power users. Thus, we put forward a nondestructive identification method based on the thermoelectric effect. The basic principle of the method is the difference of the Seebeck coefficient between copper and aluminum. Then we deduced the relationship between thermoelectric potential and the winding material, and built the test platform which could improve the temperature of transformer winding and identify winding material by measuring the thermoelectric potential. The experimental results show that the potential value of aluminum transformer is obviously higher than that of copper one, and it has a certain margin relative to the threshold value. The simulation and experimental results have proved the effectiveness of the method. The method has the high accuracy, simple operation, short time period, and high engineering application value. © 2016, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

The site preference was investigated by calculating the transfer energy of NiAl alloys with Co. The result shows that Co tends to occupy Ni site. By analyzing changes in electronic density of states, Mulliken population, overlap population and valence charge density, the electronic property and bond characters were discussed. The elastic properties calculation shows that Co increases alloy hardness.

Food Chem.,"Structural differences among various dietary polyphenols affect their absorption, metabolism, and bioactivities. In this work, chlorogenic acid (CA) and its two positional isomers, neochlorogenic acid (NCA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (CCA), were investigated for their binding reactions with human serum albumin (HSA) using fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible, Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies, as well as molecular docking. All three isomers were bound to HSA at Sudlow's site I and affected the protein secondary structure. CCA presented the strongest ability of hydrogen-bond formation, and both CA and NCA generated more electrostatic interactions with HSA. The albumin-binding capacity of these compounds decreased in the order CCA > NCA > CA. The compound with 4-esteryl structure showed higher binding affinity and larger conformational changes to HSA than that with 3- or 5-esteryl structures.

Sol. Energy,"To investigate effects of the geometry of compound parabolic concentrators (CPCs) on the performance of CPC based photovoltaic systems (CPVs), it is necessary to determine the angular distribution of the annual collectible radiation on solar cells as the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of solar cells is highly sensitive to the incident angle of solar rays, especially for radiation incident at the angle larger than 65°. In this work, a mathematical procedure is suggested to estimate the annual collectible radiation and its angular distribution on the absorber of CPC-θewhere the exit angle of solar rays is restricted within θefor the incoming radiation over its acceptance angle. Calculations show that, given the acceptance half-angle (θa), the annual collectible radiation of full CPC-θeoriented in the east–west direction (EW-CPC-θe) increases with the increase of θe; whereas for truncated EW-CPC-θewith given θaand geometric concentration (Ct), the annual radiation collected by EW-CPC-θewith θe eoriented in the north–south direction (NS-CPC-θe), the angular distribution of annual collectible radiation can be regarded to be isotropic; whereas for EW-CPC-θe, the angular distribution is dependent on its geometry and strategy of its tilt-angle adjustment but is anisotropic. Results also reveal that the annual power output from EW-CPV-θedecrease with the increase of θeand always higher than that from EW-CPV-90 except full EW-CPV-θein the case of aperture's tilt-angle being yearly adjusted four times at three tilts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20162702571600,,"Yu, Mingjiu (1); Yu, Yamei (1); Tang, Runsheng (1) ","(1) Education Ministry Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology and Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",SRENA4,615.2 Solar Power - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Efficiency - Geometry - Incident solar radiation - Photovoltaic cells - Photovoltaic effects - Radiation effects - Solar cells - Solar power generation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Runsheng(kingtang01@126.com) ",10.1016/j.solener.2016.06.046,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is partial fulfillment of funded research program 51466016, financially supported by Natural Science Foundation of China .",,0038092X,,"October 1, 2016",English,Angular distribution,,29.0,827-839,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Solar Energy,,Angular distribution of annual collectible radiation on solar cells of CPC based photovoltaic systems,,Acceptance half angle - Annual radiations - Compound parabolic concentrator - Exit angles - Mathematical procedures - Optical efficiency - Photovoltaic conversion - Photovoltaic systems,135

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"In order to clarify the contribution of rice plants to nitrogen oxides gases (NOGs) emissions, such as N2O and NOx(NO and NO2), and understand the control mechanism of light quality and intensity, the NOGs emissions from rice phyllosphere and rhizosphere and their relationship with light quality and intensity were investigated at the flowering and seed setting stage in a liquid culture medium system. Under controlled nitrogen (N) and controlled light conditions in a light-water incubator with the separation of the inner chamber and outer chamber, the experimentation strictly separated and sealed the phyllosphere in the inner chamber and the roots in the outer chamber without harm occurring on the rice plants. For different weak light qualities (yellow, green, white, red and blue lights) and intensities (dark, 0; weak, 4000 lx; moderate, 6000 lx; strong, 8000 lx), using double-chamber method, a simultaneous leaf and root determination was designed to measure the source of NOGs emissions. N2O concentration of air samples was analyzed by the gas chromatography within 10 h (from 8:00 to 18:00), while NOx(NO and NO2) gas was measured by the 42i type NO-NO2-NOxgas analyzer simultaneously. The results showed that: 1) Under a constant nitrogen nutrient (concentration of N was 90 mg/L, NH4NO3-N), when rice seedlings were treated with moderate (6000 lx) and strong light (8000 lx), the average rates of N2O and NO emission from rice phyllosphere were 27.08, 29.15 µg/(poth) and 2.25, 0.94 µg/(poth), accounting for 57.38%, 54.19% and 76.79%, 51.93% of the total N2O and NO evaporation loss for the whole rice plant, respectively. More than 90% of NOGs released from rice phyllosphere and rhizosphere was N2O, but no evident NO2emission was detected under the same condition. 2) Under a constant light intensity (1600 lx), N2O emission of rice phyllosphere in yellow, green, white, red and blue lights was 2.16, 13.40, 1.07, 3.82 and 7.08 μg/(poth), respectively. N2O emission of rice phyllosphere and NO release of rice rhizosphere could be inhibited by red and blue light compared with the results for green light (P2emission of rice phyllosphere and rhizosphere was detected, and N2O emission of rice rhizosphere could be promoted by red and blue light synchronously under the same condition. 3) Within the range of 0-8000 lx, N2O emission of phyllosphere and rhizosphere and NO release of rhizosphere could be promoted by the increase of light intensity, but NO emission from rice phyllosphere was inhibited significantly by strong light (8000 lx) illumination. 4) There was a very significant positive linear regression relationship between N2O emission of rice phyllosphere and N2O emission of rice rhizosphere (r=0.776, R2=0.587, P2O emission of rice phyllosphere could be controlled by N2O release of rice rhizosphere, and the impacts of different light quality and intensity on N2O emissions of rhizosphere would further affect N2O emissions of phyllosphere. But there was not the same correlation of NO emission between rice phyllosphere and rhizosphere. In summary, by increasing the red and blue light proportions and synchronously regulating the light intensity according to nitrogen application rate, NOGs emissions of rice phyllosphere and rhizosphere can be inhibited effectively at the flowering and seed setting stage. This work clarify the contribution of rice plant to NOGs emissions and provide a scientific basis for revealing how light-control technology affects paddy NOGs emissions at the flowering and seed setting stage. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Multiagent Grid Syst.,"Resource allocation is an important issue in any shared computer system. Recently, dynamic multi-resource fair allocation became a hot topic in cloud resource management. The most recent studies assume that each agent submits infinite number of tasks. In this paper, we consider a more realistic dynamic environment, where every agent submits a bounded number of tasks. We design a generalized dynamic dominant resource fairness mechanism, and develop a combinatorial optimal algorithm to find a fair allocation. Experimental results show that the solution produced by the proposed mechanism is close to the optimal solution. © 2015-IOS Press and the authors.",,20160401832707,,"Zhang, Xuejie (2); Li, Weidong (1, 2); Liu, Xi (1); Zhang, Xiaolu (1) ","(1) Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China (2) Dianchi College, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",,"722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Cloud computing - Combinatorial mathematics - Resource allocation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Xuejie(xjzhang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.3233/MGS-150238,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18759076,,,,15741702,4,"January 6, 2016",English,Dynamics,,29.0,245-257,,2016,"IOS Press, Nieuwe Hemweg 6B, Amsterdam, 1013 BG, Netherlands",Multiagent and Grid Systems,,Dynamic fair allocation of multiple resources with bounded number of tasks in cloud computing systems,,Combinatorial algorithm - Combinatorial optimal algorithm - dominant resource fairness - Dynamic environments - Multi-resource - Multiple resources - Optimal solutions - Resource management,11
Sci. China Earth Sci.,"The origin, development and expansion of prehistoric agriculture in East Asia have been widely investigated over the past two decades using archaeobotanical analysis from excavated Neolithic and Bronze Age sites. Research on prehistoric agriculture has predominantly focused in the valleys of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Agricultural development during the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau of southwest China, an important passageway for human migration into Southeast Asia, still remains unclear. In this paper, based on macrofossil and microfossil analysis and radiocarbon dating at the Shilinggang site, we investigate plant subsistence strategies in the Nujiang River valley during the Bronze Age period. Combined with previous archaeobotanical studies in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, we explore agricultural development processes in this area during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. Our results indicate that rice and foxtail millet were cultivated in Shilinggang around 2500 cal a BP. Three phases of prehistoric agricultural development in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau can be identified: rice cultivation from 4800–3900 cal a BP, mixed rice and millet crop (foxtail millet and broomcorn millet) cultivation from 3900–3400 cal a BP, and mixed rice, millet crop and wheat cultivation from 3400–2300 cal a BP. The development of agriculture in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau during the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods was primarily promoted by prehistoric agriculture expansion across Eurasia, agricultural expansion which was also affected by the topographic and hydrological characteristics of the area. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20161902362103,,"Li, HaiMing (1); Zuo, XinXin (2); Kang, LiHong (3); Ren, LeLe (1); Liu, FengWen (1); Liu, HongGao (1, 4); Zhang, NaiMeng (1); Min, Rui (3); Liu, Xu (3); Dong, GuangHui (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou; 730000, China (2) Key Laboratory of Cenozoic Geology and Environment, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100029, China (3) Yunnan Province Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, Kunming; 650118, China (4) College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China ",,481.1 Geology - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Bronze - Crops - Expansion - Landforms - Rivers,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Dong, GuangHui(ghdong@lzu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11430-016-5292-x,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18691897,,,,16747313,8,"August 1, 2016",English,Cultivation,,86.0,1562-1573,,2016,Science in China Press,Science China Earth Sciences,,"Prehistoric agriculture development in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, southwest China: Archaeobotanical evidence",,Bronze age - Guizhou - Macrofossil analysis - Neolithic - Phytolith analysis - Radiocarbon dating - River valley,59

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"An antialgal compound was isolated from the cultured broth of Streptomyces jiujiangensis JXJ 0074Tby using bioassay methods. Based on the data of1H-NMR,13C-NMR, ESI-MS, and thin layer chromatography, the active compound was identified as L-valine, which showed antialgal activity mainly against Microcystis. L-valine exhibited greater antialgal activities than both L-lysine and copper sulfate (CuSO4) did on Microcystis aeruginosa lawn. However, M. aeruginosa recovered growth earlier with higher growth rate in L-valine treatment than in L-lysine treatment. L-valine dissipated completely within 2 days, much quicker than L-lysine (6 days), which resulted in the lysing of more than 80 % M. aeruginosa cells and the release of amount of intracellular microcystin-LR (MC-LR) within 2 days. As a resultant, the extracellular MC-LR content was more than twice of the control from day 1 to 5. Exposure to L-valine significantly promoted the synthesis of MC-LR. L-lysine also promoted the release and synthesis of MC-LR with much lesser efficiency than L-valine. L-valine could damage Microcystis severely, causing perforation and collapse of M. aeruginosa cells and decrease of the chlorophyll. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in L-valine-treated cells of M. aeruginosa initially increased with 32.94 ± 3.37 % higher than the control after 36 h and then decreased quickly. However, the increase rate of superoxide anion radical (O2−) was much higher than that of SOD, which resulted in serious lipid peroxidation and accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA). To our knowledge, this is the first report showing L-valine active against cyanobacteria. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20160401831366,,"Zhang, Bing-Huo (1, 2); Chen, Wei (3); Li, Han-Quan (1); Yang, Jian-Yuan (1); Zha, Dai-Ming (1); Duan, Yan-Qing (3); N.Hozzein, Wael (4); Xiao, Min (2); Gao, Rui (3); Li, Wen-Jun (2) ","(1) College of Life Science, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang; 332000, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, College of Ecology and Evolution, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China (3) China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial Co.

High Temp Mater Processes,"The present work attempts to convert bamboo into a high surface area activated carbon via microwave heating. Different chemical activating agents such as KOH, NaOH, K2CO3and Na2CO3were utilized to identify a most suitable activating agent. Among the activating agents tested KOH was found to generate carbon with the highest porosity and surface area. The effect of KOH/C ratio on the porous nature of the activated carbon has been assessed. An optimal KOH/C ratio of 4 was identified, beyond which the surface area as well as the pore volume were found to decrease. At the optimized KOH/C ratio the surface area and the pore volume were estimated to be 3,441 m2/g and 2.093 ml/g, respectively, with the significant proportion of which being microporous (62.3%). Activated carbon prepared under the optimum conditions was further characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Activated carbons with so high surface area and pore volume are very rarely reported, which could be owed to the nature of the precursor and the optimal conditions of mixture ratio adopted in the present work. © 2016 by De Gruyter.",,20162902599766,,"Xia, Hongying (1, 2, 3, 4); Wu, Jian (1, 2, 3, 4); Srinivasakannan, Chandrasekar (5); Peng, Jinhui (1, 2, 3, 4); Zhang, Libo (1, 2, 3, 4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Natl.

Firstly, the aligned word processing was made by Chinese-Vietnamese sentence alignment; Secondly, the dependency parsing was done with Chinese sentences. Finally, Vietnamese Dependency Parsing Treebank was generated by Chinese-Vietnamese Languages align relationship and Chinese Dependency Tree, At the same time, The Vietnamese phrase tree converted into dependency Treebank can significantly improve the accuracy of dependency analysis. Experimental results show that this approach can simplify the process of manual collection and annotation of Vietnamese Treebank, and it can save manpower and time to build the Vietnamese Treebank.

The mechanism/principle of mutual influence of the two fields is analyzed in this paper. Equations as well as procedures for this coupling are discussed through nonlinear finite modeling and computation by ABAQUS based on typical upstream dam construction. Results indicate, (a) minor influence is observed from the coupling effect on the vertical displacement, horizontal displacement, factor of safety and location of slip surface of the initial dam whereas the influence is significant on above issues of the sub-filling dam except the location of slip surface; (b) the coupling effect is active and benefit-once the coupling is considered, slight increase in factor of safety, decrease in vertical and horizontal displacement as well as lower infiltration are observed while the effect on the location of slip surface is not obvious.

J Alloys Compd,"In this paper, a series of Cu-Al alloys (2.2, 4.5, and 6.9 wt pct Al) with decreasing stacking fault energy (SFE) were processed by surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) to obtain a gradient structure (GS). The yield strength of SMAT-ed samples is attributed to the volume fraction of GS layer and the ductility is associated with the dynamic recovery during deformation. Kocks-Mecking model was utilized to describe the storage and annihilation of dislocations in these samples. The results show that the minimal K2, which represents dynamic recovering, appears in Cu-4.5 wt%Al alloy with a medium SFE, indicating a suppressed dislocation annihilation and a delayed plastic instability during plastic deformation. Repeated stress relaxation tests were applied to characterize the activation volume and the evolution of mobile dislocation. It turns out that the highest relative mobile dislocation density (ρm/ρm0) emerges in Cu-4.5 wt%Al sample. This could be ascribed to the sufficient twin boundaries (TBs) which can keep the accumulated dislocations slipping easily and lower the exhaustion of mobile dislocation. The high ρm/ρm0demonstrates that more mobile dislocation is preserved and the dislocation annihilation is effectively prohibited in the sample, in accordance with the low K2 obtained from Kocks-Mecking model, providing a reasonable interpretation for the good ductility. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162602541864,,"Yin, Zhe (1); Sun, Lele (1); Yang, Jian (1); Gong, Yulan (1); Zhu, Xinkun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",JALCEU,"541.2 Aluminum Alloys - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Binary alloys - Copper alloys - Density (specific gravity) - Ductility - Dynamics - Mechanical properties - Recovery - Stress relaxation - Testing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Xinkun(xk_zhu@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.06.155,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: KKSY201407100, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51561015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (grant number 51561015 ), and the introduction of talents fund project of Kunming University of Science and Technology (grant number KKSY201407100 ).",,09258388,,2016,English,Aluminum alloys,,45.0,152-160,,2016,Elsevier Ltd,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,,Mechanical behavior and deformation kinetics of gradient structured Cu-Al alloys with varying stacking fault energy,,Cu-Al alloys - Dynamic recovery - Mobile dislocation density - Stacking fault energies - Surface mechanical attrition treatments,687

Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan,"Dynamic framed slotted Aloha algorithm is one kind of commonly used passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tag anti-collision algorithms. In the algorithm, the frame length requires dynamical set to ensure high identification efficiency. Generally, the settings of the frame length are associated with the number of tags and the probability of capture effect. Traditional estimation algorithms can estimate the number of tags and the probability of capture effect, but the number of tags is greater than an initial frame length when it is in dense RFID tags environment, and the estimation errors will increase significantly. In order to solve the problem that the conventional algorithms can not be applied to dense RFID tags environment, capture-aware Bayesian tag estimation is proposed in the paper, and the settings of optimal frame length with non-isometric slots are given. From the experimental results, the proposed algorithms have significantly lower estimation errors than traditional algorithms in dense RFID tags environment. And the identification efficiency got by setting the frame length according to the estimation results is also higher than that of traditional algorithms. © 2016, Science Press.

Hupo Kexue/J. Lake Sc.,"Obvious environment changes have occurred in some lakes of Yunnan Province due to intensifying human impacts over the past decades, especially in large lakes. Lake Erhai is the second largest lake in the Yunnan by surface area, which experienced the pressures of multiple environmental stressors (e.g. eutrophication, fish invasion and macrophyte degradation). The application of lake sediment records enables us to reconstruct the long-term changes of lake environment and ecosystem dynamics in situation of less monitoring data. Here multi-proxy analyses of lake sediments were conducted from a short sediment core in the south and shallow basin of Lake Erhai, which are currently eutrophic. We aimed to recognize the long-term variations and driving factors of cladoceran community, and to test for whether spatial heterogeneity exists in community responses through a comparison with monitoring data and previous results from the deep basin of Lake Erhai. Our results showed that cladoceran production showed an overall increasing trend in the past century, and since 1990s bosminid production increased significantly with a general trend of the oligotrophic taxon of Bosmina longispina replaced by B. longirostris. In addition, bosminid production and the body size (i.e. carapace and antennule length) displayed a decrease during early 1990s, were in good correspondence with the period when the population of the exotic noodlefish was well established. Based on the constrained cluster analysis, the historical changes of cladoceran community were characterized by three distinct phases: littoral cladocerans were dominant before the 1990s and the relative abundance of pelagic cladocerans increased rapidly from the 1990s before the pelagic cladocerans became predominant during early 2000s. The principal component analysis showed that the environmental gradient associated with macrophyte coverage accounted for 61.64% of the total variance in the cladoceran community. Compared with previous studies, we observed that the increased production of cladocerans during the 1970s and an abrupt decrease during the 1980s recorded in shallow basin of Lake Erhai were not reflected in the core from the deep basin, indicating that spatial heterogeneity exists in ecosystem changes of Lake Erhai. We also found the obvious shift of bosminid body sizes in response to fish introduction. Overall, our results revealed the long-term changes of cladoceran production and community structure mainly as a consequence of lake eutrophication and macrophyte degradation, while fish introduction also played a role in structuring zooplankton community through changing predation pressure. Therefore the environmental stressors which could be identified through sedimentary records should be taken into account for sustainable management and ecological restoration of Lake Erhai through facilitating lake ecosystem assessment. © 2016 by Journal of Lake Sciences.",Open Access,20160902037402,,"Lu, Huibin (1); Chen, Guangjie (1); Cai, Yanfeng (1); Wang, Jiaoyuan (1); Chen, Xiaolin (1); Duan, Lizeng (1); Zhang, Hucai (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Plateau Lake Ecology and Global Change, School of Tourism & Geography, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,"454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,Anthropometry - Cluster analysis - Ecosystems - Eutrophication - Fish - Monitoring - Paleolimnology - Principal component analysis - Sediments - Sustainable development,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Guangjie(guangjiechen@gmail.com) ",10.18307/2016.0115,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10035427,1,"January 6, 2016",Chinese,Lakes,,14.0,132-140,,2016,Science Press,Hupo Kexue/Journal of Lake Sciences,,"Cladoceran community responses to eutrophication, fish introduction and macrophyte degradation over the past century in Lake Erhai",,Cladoceran - Community structures - Ecological restoration - Environmental gradient - Environmental stressors - Lake-sediment records - Sustainable management - Zooplankton communities,28

Nanoscale Res. Lett.,"Abstract: The single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-molecularly imprinted powder (MIP) composites in this paper were prepared by mixing SWCNTs with MIPs. The structure and micrograph of the as-prepared SWCNTs-MIPs samples were characterized by XRD and TEM. The gas-sensing properties were tested through indirect-heating sensors based on SWCNT-MIP composites fabricating on an alumina tube with Au electrodes and Pt wires. The results showed that the structure of SWCNTs-MIPs is of orthogonal perovskite and the average particle size of the SWCNTs-MIPs was in the range of 10–30 nm. SWCNTs-MIPs exhibit good methanol gas-sensitive properties. At 90 °C, the response to 1 ppm methanol is 19.7, and the response to the interferent is lower than 5 to the other interferent gases (ethanol, formaldehyde, toluene, acetone, ammonia, and gasoline). The response time and recovery time are 50 and 58 s, respectively.

However, water hyacinth has a strong ability to absorb nitrogen, phosphorus and other harmful heavy metal elements from water, so it has been widely used in the projects of ecological rehabilitation of water bodies in recent years over the world, which has made the problem of resource utilization of water hyacinth more important and urgent than before. Because water hyacinth is high in cellulose and hemicellulose content, it has the potential to be transformed into biomass fuel. Using mechanical force, water hyacinth can be extruded or compressed into biomass pellets, and could be an important way to utilize water hyacinth as an energy source. In the process of biomass densification, different chemical compositions of biomass can result in different compressing process parameters of biomass pellets. As an aquatic plant, the difference in the chemical composition of water hyacinth from other terrestrial plants can result in different compressing process parameters of water hyacinth pellets from other biomass pellets. Among all the compressing process parameters of biomass pellets, compressing force, temperature, moisture content and particle size of material are the 4 important process parameters that greatly influence the quality of biomass pellet fuel. In order to improve the densification quality of pellet fuel made from water hyacinth, the densification process of water hyacinth pellets was experimentally studied by using a compressing apparatus in the laboratory. Firstly, the single-factor tests were carried out, in which the variables were compressing force (1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0 and 7.5 kN), temperature (80, 90, 100, 110 and 120), moisture content of material (8%, 10%, 12%, 14% and 16%), and particle size of material (0.43, 0.58, 0.74, 0.89 and 1.07 mm) respectively. After that, the orthogonal test was also carried out, which was four-factor and three-level (compressing force of 5, 6 and 7 kN, temperature of 80, 100 and 120, moisture content of 10%, 12% and 14% and particle size of 0.58, 0.74, and 0.89 mm). The regression analyses and modeling equations between the 4 process parameters and the pellet density and diametric compression strength of water hyacinth pellets were performed with SPSS 17.0 statistical analysis software, and the optimal process parameters were obtained by the optimal toolbox of MATLAB. The results showed that the compressing force was the biggest effect factor of pellet density, followed by particle size, temperature and moisture content. The temperature, compressing force and particle size of material had almost the same effect on the diametric compression strength, while the moisture content had the least effect. The optimal process parameters were compressing force of 6 kN, temperature of 100, moisture content of 12% and particle size of 0.58 mm. Under those optimum conditions, the pellet density and diametric compression strength of water hyacinth pellets could reach 1362.21 kg/m3and 1.44 kN respectively. The results will provide a reference for the industrial production of high-quality water hyacinth pellets. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"In order to study the catalytic pyrolysis process of the three components (Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) with participation of mesoporous ZSM-5, Firstly the pyrolysis of three major components in biomass and wood powder of Pinus yunnanensis were conducted. Then catalytic pyrolysis of the three major components (microcrystalline cellulose, xylan and alkali lignin) and wood powder of Pinus yunnanensis were carried out with the mesoporous ZSM-5 as catalyst. Compositions of the derived bio-oil were identified by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). By comparing the product distribution in bio-oil between pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis of three major components and wood powder, the catalytic pyrolysis mechanism of biomass was studied. What is more, ZSM-5 was analyzed by N2adsorption-desorption and XRD diffraction, and ultimate analysis of bio-oil obtained were also identified. The results indicated that during catalytic pyrolysis of three major components and Pinus yunnanensis, mesoporous ZSM-5 showed different performance. The results of XRD diffraction pattern and N2absorption/desorption demonstrated ZSM-5 used had abundant mesopores with mean pore size of 6.23nm. Through pyrolysis cellulose was mainly converted into β-D-allose (20.39%), furfural, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, 3-propyl glutaric acid, and 2, 4-Pentadienoic acid. In the process of catalytic pyrolysis, ZSM-5 transformed β-D-allose (20.39%), furfural, 3-Propyl glutaric acid, and 2, 4-Pentadienoic acid into 1-methylnaphthalene and 2, 6-dimethylnaphthalene. ZSM-5 performed the supreme catalytic activity for cellulose among 4 feedstocks, and the relative content of total aromatics in bio-oil obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose was 63.89%. The raw bio-oil from hemicellulose pyrolysis mainly contained furfural (67.78%) and 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. But in the course of catalytic pyrolysis, the relative content of furfural reduced drastically to 2.66% while the relative content of aromatics increased to 36.81%, especially, naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene. The primary composition in bio-oil from lignin pyrolysis was 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (82.33%), which was converted into 1, 7-Dimethylnaphthalene and 1, 8-dimethylnaphthalene by ZSM-5 through catalytic pyrolysis. The content of 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol decreased to 77.97% while the relative content of total aromatics increased to 14.14%. The bio-oil obtained from Pinus yunnanensis pyrolysis contained 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (9.73%), 2-methoxy-4 methyl phenol, (Z)-isoeugenol, and 4-hydroxy-3-tert- butylanisole. Through catalytic pyrolysis 2-methoxy-4 methyl phenol and (Z)-isoeugenol were obviously converted into 1-methylnaphthalene, 1-methylene-1 hydrogen-indene, and 2, 6-dimethylnaphthalene, and the total aromatics in bio-oil reached at 53.99%. When the Pinus yunnanensis was used as feedstock, the reusability and regeneration of mesoporous ZSM-5 were studied by comparing the chemical components and ultimate analysis of bio-oil. With the use time of ZSM-5 increasing from 1 to 3, in bio-oil the amount of oxygen compounds augmented while aromatics content reduced from 53.99% to 43.32%, and the ultimate analysis showed O content increased with the decreased C content. However, the full catalytic performance of regenerated mesoporous ZSM-5 restored almost. After regeneration ZSM-5 yielded bio-oil with aromatics content of 52.14% and O content of 26.89%. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

"Chinese Control Conf., CCC","In the process of gene expression, time delays are unavoidable due primarily to the slow process of transcription, translation and translocation processes. It is observed that gene regulatory system may lose its stability even for very small delay. Motivated by the regulation of gene expression proposed in Shimoni et al. [Molecular Systems Biology, 2007], in this paper, a gene regulatory network mediated by small non-coding RNAs with both transcriptional and translational time delays is formulated. The nonlinear dynamic behaviors such as stability, bifurcations and oscillations are studied. It is shown that both transcriptional and translational time delays can induce gene expression in Escherichia coli to be oscillatory even when its deterministic counterpart exhibits no oscillations. Moreover, the obtained results are in consistence with experimental observations found in the biological literatures [Elowitz MB et al.: Nature, 2000, 403, pp.335-338; Lennart Hilbert et al.: Mol.

Opt. Lett.,"Satellite laser ranging operating at 1064 nm wavelength using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) is successfully demonstrated. A SNSPD with an intrinsic quantum efficiency of 80% and a dark count rate of 100 cps at 1064 nm wavelength is developed and introduced to Yunnan Observatory in China. With improved closed-loop telescope systems (field of view of about 26''), satellites including Cryosat, Ajisai, and Glonass with ranges of 1600 km, 3100 km, and 19,500 km, respectively, are experimentally ranged with mean echo rates of 1200/min, 4200/min, and 320/min, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of laser ranging for satellites using SNSPDs at 1064 nm wavelength.

"Proc. - Int. Conf. Inf. Sci. Control Eng., ICISCE","Among the very high frequency antenna measurement methods used in radio astronomical observation, phase measurement technology is one of vital importance in the process of data acceptance and disposal, for it has great priority in antenna pattern and accuracy in tracking radio source at different region. Particularly, affected by the natural environment, cable phase error is produced, thus the traditional measurement method that depends on different environmental experience value to correct phase error is complex and inaccurate. According to the principle of low frequency antenna array phase measurement, this paper suggests a better method, which uses AD8302 to transfer the two calibration source signal phase difference of the receiver and transfer feeder to the corresponding direct voltage, then realizes single channel AD sampling with 12 bits quantization accuracy, finally does the error analysis and correction to achieve phase error correction. Through testing the precision of phase error of the cable given by the system under measuring conditions of low frequency (2MHz), high frequency (300MHz), etc. We can prove the system has a very high reliability, thus could be widely used in related antenna array error correction and cable error measurement. © 2016 IEEE.",,20165003107129,7726402,"Yue, Linzhu (1, 2); Dong, Liang (2, 3) ","(1) University of Chinese Academy Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (2) Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan; 650011, China (3) Information College of Yunnan University, Kunming; 650001, China ",,"657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 713.3 Modulators, Demodulators, Limiters, Discriminators, Mixers - 942.2 Electric Variables Measurements",124721.0,"July 8, 2016 - July 10, 2016","Beijing, China","3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2016",Cables - Directional patterns (antenna) - Error correction - Phase measurement - Quantization (signal) - Radio astronomy - Signal receivers,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICISCE.2016.305,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509025350.0,,,"October 31, 2016",English,Antenna arrays,"Proceedings - 2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2016",6.0,1428-1432,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2016",Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture; China Jiliang University; et al.; The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Hull; Xiamen University,The Cable Phase Difference Detection of Very High Frequency (VHF) Antenna Array Based on Ad8302,,AD8302 - Antenna array errors - Astronomical observation - Measurement technologies - Natural environments - Phase difference detections - Phase error correction - Quantization accuracy,
Clim. Change,"With the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged to promote strategies and policies to substantially reduce their carbon emissions. To align public sentiment with potentially expensive climate mitigation policy, climate change education is considered an essential tool in tackling climate change, particularly for the young generation. However, a general lack of engagement is driven by the perception that climate change is irrelevant at local and individual scales. Based on a modified version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, we implemented a new climate change educational programme, in 12 rural areas of China, where adolescents communicated with local seniors (aged ≥ 60 years) in focus groups to discuss local climate over the past decades. Seniors’ memories of extreme climatic events generally were in concordance with meteorological data. The adolescents’ uncertainty about climate change exhibited significant change after the programme, followed by concern, risk perception, and perceived behavioural control. Based on mediation analysis, the shift in adolescent concern and perceived behavioural control translated into greater willingness to support climate change mitigation. Thus, we suggest that climate change education should emphasize place-based strategies that highlight the relevance of global climate change through local impacts and individual experiences vis-a-vis inter-generational communication to promote greater engagement with climate change. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,20162902619304,,"Hu, Sifan (1, 2); Chen, Jin (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Tropical Forest Ecology, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mengla; Yunnan; 666303, China (2) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China ",CLCHDX,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,,,,,Risk perception,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Jin(cj@xtbg.org.cn) ",10.1007/s10584-016-1746-6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15731480,,,,01650009,3-4,"October 1, 2016",English,Climate change,,51.0,425-438,,2016,Springer Netherlands,Climatic Change,,Place-based inter-generational communication on local climate improves adolescents’ perceptions and willingness to mitigate climate change,,Climate change mitigation - Climate mitigations - Global climate changes - Mediation analysis - Meteorological data - Perceived behavioural controls - Public sentiments - Theory of planned behaviour,138

With the influence of the photonic band gap, quantum cutting emission of Tb3+, Yb3+ was investigated in photonic crystals by photoluminescence and fluorescence lifetime. The result clearly shows that, when the spontaneous emission of donor Tb3+ is inhibited by photonic band gap, Tb3+-Yb3+ quantum cutting quantum efficiency from Tb3+ to Yb3+ could be enhanced from 131.2% to 140.5%. The mechanisms for the influence of the photonic band gap on quantum cutting process of Tb3+ and Yb3+ are discussed.

World PM Congr. Exhib.,"In this work, the porous hydroxyapatite (HA) bone repair materials were fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at pressureless conditions with the addition of ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3)at 1050 °C. Porous characteristic, mechanical properties and biocompatibility of the porous HA were investigated. The results showed that 43.8%-69.3% porosity and 100-500 μm pore size of the porous HA could be obtained by the addition of NH4HCO3from 10-30 wt.%. The elastic modulus of the porous HA was in the range of 142.5-48.6 MPa and the compression strength range from 4.6 to 1.1 MPa. The biologic test showed that the porous HA exhibited good biocompatibility. Rabbit bone marrow stromal cells validated the celluar acceptance of the surfaces of porous samples. In summary, the porous HA has preferable porosity, pore structures, mechanical properties and good biocompatibility by the SPStechnique.

Environ. Earth Sci.,"The study of multi-scale land use change, as well as the coupling mechanism of multi-scale land use change and its driving factors, has important scientific and technological significance for the drawing up of land use planning and land resources allocation optimization. In this paper, the concepts of the core structure relationships of coupling models and the characteristics of a coupling system for the driving factors of spatial multi-scale land use change are discussed first. Then, the feasibility of the development of the models is discussed. Next, the core methods used to establish the coupling models are described. To elaborate upon the research, organic, bottom-to-top and interconnecting three-level-scale regions in Yunnan Province, Kunming City and Yiliang County are selected. Based on the constructed system dynamics and coupling model, this paper completed the reproduction, tracking and simulation of the temporal behavior of the coupling system and determined the interactional and correlative coupling mechanisms among the land use type changes and their core driving factors, from 1999 to 2008. The results of the simulation and test of the coupling model have shown that the mean relative error is −0.155 %, and samples with relative error values distributed in the range (−3.91, 4.98 %) account for 90.3 % of the total samples. This study suggests that the coupling model of spatial multi-scale driving factors could reflect the land use change and the coupling mechanism of its multi-scale driving factors with high simulation accuracy. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20161302150023,529,"Zhao, J.S.

Acta Geophys. Sin.,"We systematically examine how dynamic stresses from seismic waves following the 2014 MS7.3 Yutian, Xinjiang, earthquake affect aftershocks and regional microseismicity in the near and far field. The full Coulomb stress changes are computed based on the discrete wavenumber method. We find that the static Coulomb stress changes caused by the MS7.3 earthquake discourage aftershocks occurrence in the southwestern part of the aftershock zone, which may explain why the aftershock activity in this region is relatively weak. Aftershock rates at the region about 30 km to the northeast of the mainshock are relatively high, which are consistent with positive dynamic and static stress changes in that region, with the peak values of 2.78 MPa and 0.80 MPa, respectively. Aftershocks about 45 km north of the mainshock are mostly triggered by the dynamic stress change with a peak value of 0.72 MPa. The peak values of dynamic stress change in the remote Shaya and Jiashi areas are 0.09 MPa and 0.1 MPa, respectively, which are high enough to trigger microearthquakes in these areas. Overall the spatial distributions of dynamic stress changes induced by the Yutian mainshock show asymmetrical patterns, and there is a positive correlation between the aftershock distribution and the positive area of dynamic stress change in the northeastern and northern regions. © 2016, Science Press.

Appl. Math. Comput.,"Understanding the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behaviors represents one of the most interesting challenges in natural and social science. A great number of studies have investigated this question via spatial reciprocity, namely, players are put on networks and obtain their payoffs by playing the game with their neighbors. It has also been verified that in networked population spatial heterogeneity and coevolution setup promote cooperation theoretically and empirically. Inspired by this well-known fact, we consider a coevolution mechanism: players not only adopts the strategy of his opponent, but also learn his opponent's ability. We find a more interesting and counterintuitive phenomenon: compared with the heterogeneity scenario, this coevolution setup does not promote the cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma game. With regard to this observation, we unveil that it is related with the range of distribution of individuals’ ability. The coevolution setup finally makes the individual's ability shrink towards a single value. To explore the generality of this finding, we have testified on different types of topology structure. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,20162602545101,,"Shen, Chen (1); Lu, Jun (1); Shi, Lei (1) ","(1) School of Statistics and Mathematics, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; Yunnan; 650221, China ",AMHCBQ,922.1 Probability Theory - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Game theory,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shi, Lei(shi_lei65@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.amc.2016.05.044,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 11161053, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1302267, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We appreciate the support from (i) National Natural Science Foundation of China (Yunnan United Fund (Key Project) Grants no.

Their structures were determined through 1D and 2D NMR, such as HSQC, HMBC,1H-1H COSY, HSQC-TOCSY, and ROESY, as well as other spectroscopic analysis combined with chemical evidence. These compounds shared the same aglycone, 3β,16α-dihydroxy-pregn-5-en-20-one, and contained the deoxysugar chain and the glucose chain which were linked to C-3 and C-16 of the aglycone, respectively. The sweetness potency was evaluated by a human sensory panel test and preliminary structure-taste relationship was discussed. The sweetness intensities of these compounds are between 50 and 400 times greater than that of sucrose.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Aims. We aim to probe the internal structure and investigate with asteroseismology for more detailed information on the δ Scuti star HD 50844. Methods. We analyse the observed frequencies of the δ Scuti star HD 50844 and search for possible multiplets, which are based on the rotational splitting law of g-mode. We tried to disentangle the frequency spectra of HD 50844 only by means of rotational splitting. We then compare these with theoretical pulsation modes, which correspond to stellar evolutionary models with various sets of initial metallicity and stellar mass, to find the best-fitting model. Results. There are three multiplets, including two complete triplets and one incomplete quintuplet, in which mode identifications for spherical harmonic degree l and azimuthal number m are unique. The corresponding rotational period of HD 50844 is found to be 2.44 days. The physical parameters of HD 50844 are well limited in a small region by three modes that have been identified as nonradial ones (f11, f22, and f29) and by the fundamental radial mode (f4). Our results show that the three nonradial modes (f11, f22, and f29) are all mixed modes, which mainly represent the property of the helium core. The fundamental radial mode (f4) mainly represents the property of the stellar envelope. To fit these four pulsation modes, both the helium core and the stellar envelope need to be matched to the actual structure of HD 50844. Finally, the mass of the helium core of HD 50844 is estimated to be 0.173 ± 0.004 Mofor the first time. The physical parameters of HD 50844 are determined to be M = 1.81 ± 0.01 Mo, Z = 0.008 ± 0.001.

Rock Soil Mech,"To analyze the influence of an adjacent foundation on ground stiffness, a new concept of ground stiffness influence coefficient is introduced, which is defined as the ratio of the ground stiffness with the adjacent foundation to that without. Based on the Mindlin solution, an analytical expression of the influence coefficient is derived from a system of two rigid, surface, rectangular foundations under three-dimensional elastic half space. Through calculating the influence coefficient, we analyze the influences of clear distance, side-length ratio of foundations and Poisson's ratio of the ground soil on ground stiffness when the adjacent foundation exists. It is shown that: (1) The ground stiffness can be improved when the effect of the adjacent foundation is taken into account. (2) The influence of the adjacent foundation on ground stiffness shows a positive correlation with the side-length ratio and the Poisson's ratio, and a negative correlation with the clear distance. (3) The influence is more significant in clay ground than in other kinds of ground, such as silt ground. (4) It is not necessary to consider the influence of adjacent foundation when the clear distance is larger than 15 times the side length of the foundation or the side-length ratio is less than 0.1. In other cases, however, we should decide whether or not it is necessary to consider the influence of both the clear distance and the side-length ratio. © 2016, Academia Sinica.

"Annu. Meet. Assoc. Comput. Linguist., ACL - Short Pap.","Dimensional sentiment analysis aims to recognize continuous numerical values in multiple dimensions such as the valence-arousal (VA) space. Compared to the categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary classification (i.e., positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. This study proposes a regional CNN-LSTM model consisting of two parts: regional CNN and LSTM to predict the VA ratings of texts. Unlike a conventional CNN which considers a whole text as input, the proposed regional CNN uses an individual sentence as a region, dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful affective information in each region can be extracted and weighted according to their contribution to the VA prediction.

J. Iron Steel Res. Int.,"In order to improve the toughness and wear resistance of high-boron medium-carbon alloy (HBMCA), a novel wear-resistant HBMCA comprising granular borocarbide was obtained by titanium, magnesium, and rare earth modifications. These modifications gave rise to greatly refined as-cast eutectic borocarbide structures and a less interconnected continuous borocarbide network. Heat treatment mostly produced broken and spheriodized borocarbides that tended to exist as isolated particles in modified HBMCA. The heat treated modified HBMCA exhibited enhanced hardness than pristine and impact toughness was improved significantly to 12.5 J/cm2. In addition, it displayed 2.39 and 1.7 times greater wear resistance than high-speed steel (HSS) and high nickel-chromium alloy steel (Cr25) at high temperature (500 °C), respectively.

Gaodianya Jishu,"The impulse potential distribution in actual power transformer winding(due to possessing no tap pin )can not directly be measured. Using similar electric property and tapped transformer model instead of the original model to research the measuring impulse voltage distribution has important engineering practical value. To research all kinds of physical constants and electric field intensity under the same conditions between reduced-scaled and original models, according to the relationship between physical quantities, we established a simplified shrinkage ratio criterion. Secondly, according to the actual power transformer original model and shrinkage ratio criterion, we designed a similar ratio 1/20, typed 10 kVA-220 V/2 400 V tapped transformer reduced-scaled model. Then, using the finite element simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics, we simulated the reduced-scaled and original models of the electric field, magnetic field, and electromagnetic field. Finally, we established a test platform to measure the winding impulse voltage distribution of transformer reduced-scaled model under ns pulse voltage. The comprehensive and comparative analyses of the simulation verify the correctness of the rule of shrinkage ratio. It is found that the impulse voltage distribution of transformer winding is uneven and high-voltage side withstanding voltage is higher. © 2016, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Huagong Xuebao,"In a system sealed by dry gas, the Joule-Thomson (JT) effect occurs when the gas flows through the components of filters, valves, orifices and end faces, which may cause the temperature drop of sealing gas, even the appearance of liquid condensation. Generally, the Joule-Thomson effect is represented by Joule-Thomson coefficient. As to the hydrogen, nitrogen, air and carbon dioxide, which are often encountered for the cases of sealing by dry gas, the corresponding Joule-Thomson (JT) coefficients were calculated by four classical equations of state (EOS) of VDW, RK, SRK and PR. Subsequently, those calculated coefficients are compared with the experimental data in the literatures. The JT coefficient curves and Joule-Thomson inversion curves (JTIC) were plotted using the optimal equation of state. As to air and nitrogen through the end faces of dry sealing gas, the gas temperature drops caused by JT effect were calculated by applying the computer program. It shows that the Joule-Thomson effect of real gas, which have important influence on the throttle of dry sealing gas. At room temperature, hydrogen showed exothermic effect, while nitrogen, air and carbon dioxide endothermic (cooling) effect. The corresponding Joule-Thomson (JT) coefficients were calculated by the four classical EOS, the average relative error and maximum relative error of RK equation were the minimum, less than 4% and 10%, respectively. The JT effect of real gas causes large temperature difference in the dry sealing gas, of which the gas pressure more influences on the temperature drop than the gas temperature does. When the pressure is small, the temperature drop by the JT effect can be negligible. © All Right Reserved.",,20164402973846,,"Deng, Chengxiang (1); Song, Pengyun (1); Ma, Ailin (1) ","(1) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",HUKHAI,619.1.1 Pipe Accessories - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Carbon dioxide - Drops - Equations of state of gases - Gases - Hydrogen - Kinetic theory of gases - Pressure effects - Thermoelectricity - Van der Waals forces,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Pengyun(songpengyunkm@ina.com) ",10.11949/j.issn.0438-1157.20151892,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51465026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",Foundation item: supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51465026),,04381157,9,"September 5, 2016",Chinese,Seals,,27.0,3833-3842,,2016,Chemical Industry Press,Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal,,Analysis of Joule-Thomson effect of real gas system sealed by dry gas,,Dry gas seal - Equation of state - Inversion curves - Joule-Thomson coefficient - Real gas,67

Int. J. Hybrid Inf.

Therefore this paper presents a task scheduling mechanism based on simulated annealing algorithm. The algorithm is a modern heuristic algorithm and overcome the shortcoming of the local optimum search method. The algorithm uses a greedy algorithm to generate the initial value, and heat to a sufficiently high temperature and according to certain rules to generate a new value. If the new value is better than the original value or at a certain probability can be accepted, then replace the original value with the new value until cool. Experiments proved the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm.

Electrochim Acta,"In general, carbon materials with high specific surface area (SSA), well-balanced pore size distributions, and appropriate content of heteroatom functionalities are essential to enhance the performance of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) for capacitive energy storage. In this study, a low-cost biological waste-stiff silkworm was first used as precursor for the synthesis of well-developed microporous carbon (SSMC) material by simple steps of carbonization and further activation. The SSMC was endowed with ultra-high SSA (2523 m2 g−1), large pore volume (1.37 m3 g−1), and high content of heteroatom functionalities (∼3.5 at% N and ∼5.1 at% O). EDLCs employed SSMC as active material showed high specific capacitance of 304 F g−1and 256 F g−1at current densities of 1 A g−1and 20 A g−1, respectively, suggesting the good rate capability.

Sci. Adv.,"Starvation is probably the most common stressful situation in nature. In vertebrates, elevation of the biogenic amine norepinephrine levels is common during starvation. However, the precise role of norepinephrine in nutrient deprivation remains largely unknown. Wereport that in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, up-regulationof the biosynthesis of octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of norepinephrine, serves as amechanism to adapt to starvation. During nutrient deprivation, the nuclear receptor DAF-12, known to sense nutritional cues, up-regulates the expression of tbh-1 that encodes tyramine β-hydroxylase, a key enzyme for octopamine biosynthesis, in the RIC neurons. Octopamine induces the expression of the lipase gene lips-6 via its receptor SER-3 in the intestine. LIPS-6, in turn, elicits lipidmobilization. Our findings reveal that octopamine acts as an endocrine regulator linking nutrient cues to lipolysis to maintain energy homeostasis, and suggest that such amechanismmay be evolutionally conserved in diverse organisms. © 2016 The Authors, some rights reserved.",Open Access,20180804813011,e1501372,"Tao, Jun (1); Ma, Yi-Cheng (1); Yang, Zhong-Shan (1, 2); Zou, Cheng-Gang (1); Zhang, Ke-Qin (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) College of Basic Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",,461.9 Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Amines - Biochemistry - Biosynthesis - Enzymes - Gene expression - Norepinephrine,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zou, Cheng-Gang(fushu111@qq.com) ",10.1126/sciadv.1501372,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),23752548,,,,,5.0,May 2016,English,Nutrients,,41.0,,,2016,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Science Advances,,Octopamine connects nutrient cues to lipid metabolism upon nutrient deprivation,,Biogenic amines - Caenorhabditis elegans - Diverse organisms - Energy homeostasis - Free-living nematodes - Lipid metabolisms - Nuclear receptors - Nutrient deprivation,2

J. Sep. Sci.,"In this study, magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotube nanoparticles were synthesized and used as the adsorbent for the sums of malachite green, gentian violet and leucomalachite green, leucogentian violet in aquaculture water samples followed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. This method was based on in situ reduction of chromic malachite green, gentian violet to colorless leucomalachite green, leucogentian violet with potassium borohydride, respectively. The obtained adsorbent combines the advantages of carbon nanotubes and Fe3O4nanoparticles in one material for separation and preconcentration of the reductive dyes in aqueous media. The structure and properties of the prepared nanoparticles were characterized by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The main parameters affecting the adsorption recoveries were investigated and optimized, including reducing agent concentration, type and amount of sorbent, sample pH, and eluting conditions. Under the optimum conditions, the limits of detection in this method were 0.22 and 0.09 ng/mL for malachite green and gentian violet, respectively.

Kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption process of OFL and TCS followed the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. The Freundlich isotherm described the OFL adsorption process well but the adsorption of TCS fitted the Langmuir isotherm better. Thermodynamics and isotherm parameters suggested that both OFL and TCS adsorption were feasible and spontaneous. Hydrogen bond and Lewis acid-base reaction may be the dominating adsorption mechanism of OFL and TCS, respectively. Compared to other adsorbents, biomorphic HAP is environmentally friendly and has the advantages of high adsorption capacity, exhibiting potential application for PPCPs removal. © IWA Publishing 2016 Water Science & Technology.",,20163202679278,,"Huang, Bin (1); Xiong, Dan (1); Zhao, Tingting (1); He, Huan (1); Pan, Xuejun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",WSTED4,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice,,,,,Cotton - Crystal structure - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Hydrogen bonds - Hydroxyapatite - Ionic strength - Isotherms - Kinetic theory - Nanocomposites - Precipitation (chemical) - Removal - Scanning electron microscopy - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray powder diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pan, Xuejun(xjpan@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.2166/wst.2016.209,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,02731223,1.0,July 2016,English,Adsorption,,26.0,276-286,,2016,"IWA Publishing, 12 Caxton Street, London, SW1H 0QS, United Kingdom",Water Science and Technology,,Adsorptive removal of PPCPs by Biomorphic HAP templated from cotton,,Biomorphic - Brunauer emmett tellers - High adsorption capacity - Kinetic study - Lewis acid-base reactions - Pharmaceuticals and personal care products - PPCPs - Pseudo-second order model,74

Front. Comput. Sci.,"A co-location pattern is a set of spatial features whose instances frequently appear in a spatial neighborhood. This paper efficiently mines the top-k probabilistic prevalent co-locations over spatially uncertain data sets and makes the following contributions: 1) the concept of the top-k probabilistic prevalent co-locations based on a possible world model is defined; 2) a framework for discovering the top-k probabilistic prevalent co-locations is set up; 3) a matrix method is proposed to improve the computation of the prevalence probability of a top-k candidate, and two pruning rules of the matrix block are given to accelerate the search for exact solutions; 4) a polynomial matrix is developed to further speed up the top-k candidate refinement process; 5) an approximate algorithm with compensation factor is introduced so that relatively large quantity of data can be processed quickly. The efficiency of our proposed algorithms as well as the accuracy of the approximation algorithms is evaluated with an extensive set of experiments using both synthetic and real uncertain data sets. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20161102094194,,"Wang, Lizhen (1); Han, Jun (1); Chen, Hongmei (1); Lu, Junli (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra,,,,,Approximation algorithms - Computational efficiency - Location - Polynomials,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Hongmei(lzhwang2005@126.com) ",10.1007/s11704-015-4196-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20952236,,,,20952228,3.0,"June 1, 2016",English,Matrix algebra,,23.0,488-503,,2016,Higher Education Press,Frontiers of Computer Science,,Top-k probabilistic prevalent co-location mining in spatially uncertain data sets,,Approximate algorithms - Co-location patterns - Co-locations - Compensation factor - Matrix methods - Polynomial matrices - Spatial neighborhoods - Uncertain data sets,10
Huagong Xuebao,"The viscosity and electrical conductivity of Betaine·HCl-6EG-nNiCl2·6H2O deep eutectic ionic liquids, formed by adding nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O) into a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of Betaine hydrochloride (Betaine·HCl) and Ethylene glycol (EG) in 1:6 molar ratio, were reported at 303-353 K and 303-348 K with an interval of 5 K under atmospheric pressure. The viscosity and electrical conductivity associated with temperature and NiCl2·6H2O concentration were investigated, respectively. The results revealed that within the selected temperature and NiCl2·6H2O concentration ranges, Betaine·HCl-6EG-nNiCl2·6H2O deep eutectic ionic liquids showed low viscosities and good electrical conductivities. With increasing temperature, the viscosities decreased and electrical conductivities increased. The effect of temperature was more significant on viscosity than on electrical conductivity. The dependence of temperature of viscosity and electrical conductivity was found to be greatly described by Arrhenius empirical expressions. According to these expressions, the activation energies for viscous flow and conduction were calculated. With increasing NiCl2·6H2O concentration, the values of the activation energies for viscous flow and conduction increased. Because of the adding NiCl2·6H2O, the formations of the larger size complex ions reduced the concentrations of the effective conductive ions and increased the ionic radius, resulting in increasing viscosity and decreasing electrical conductivity. © All Right Reserved.",,20161902356028,,"Gong, Kai (1); Hua, Yixin (1); Xu, Cunying (1); Li, Jian (1); Li, Yan (1); Zhou, Zhongren (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",HUKHAI,"443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 531.2 Metallography - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,Activation energy - Atmospheric pressure - Betaines - Chlorine compounds - Electric conductivity - Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Eutectics - Ionic liquids - Ions - Numerical analysis - Organic solvents - Temperature - Viscosity - Viscous flow,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hua, Yixin(huakust@163.com) ",10.11949/j.issn.0438-1157.20151264,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 21263007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51274108, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Foundation item: supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51274108, 21263007).",,04381157,4.0,"April 1, 2016",Chinese,Nickel compounds,,31.0,1090-1097,,2016,Chemical Industry Press,Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal,,Viscosity and electrical conductivity of Betaine·HCl-6EG-nNiCl2·6H2O deep eutectic ionic liquids,,Concentration ranges - Deep eutectic solvents - Effect of temperature - Electrical conductivity - Empirical expression - Increasing temperatures - Increasing viscosity - Low viscosity,67
J. Iron Steel Res. Int.,"For further research on the control model of multifunctional hot metal ladles between the ironmaking and steelmaking interface, the hot metal ladles of K steel plant were taken as the object to analyze the operation process. The factors of blast furnace supply and basic oxygen furnace demand were proposed. According to the principle of supply and demand balance, the control model of hot metal was researched under the following factor conditions: equal to, greater than, and less than 1, respectively. The distribution model of the blast furnace, steelmaking works, and online buffering was proposed. When the supply and demand factor is equal to 1, the turnover number of hot metal ladles equals 16 and the turnover cycle of hot metal ladles equals 512 min. When the factor is greater than 1, the total number of hot metal ladles is equal to the normal turnover number plus the turnover number of the cast iron machine. When the factor is less than 1, the total number of hot metal ladles is equal to the normal turnover number plus the accumulating number. Satisfactory effects were obtained by applying the control model in production. The numbers of turnover ladles and accumulating ladles were reduced. © 2016 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute",,20165103152783,,"HUANG, Bang-fu (1, 2); TIAN, Nai-yuan (3); MA, Zhi-wei (1, 2); SHI, Zhe (1, 2); ZHOU, Xiao-lei (1, 2) ","(1) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Clean Metallurgy Key Laboratory of Complex Iron Resources, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) School of Metallurgical and Ecological Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing; 100083, China ",,532.2 Blast Furnaces - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 545.3 Steel - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 951 Materials Science - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Basic oxygen converters - Blast furnaces - Cast iron - Economics - Interfaces (materials) - Metals - Oxygen supply - Steelmaking - Steelmaking furnaces,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/S1006-706X(16)30186-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22103988,,,,1006706X,12.0,"December 1, 2016",English,Ladles,,20.0,1262-1267,,2016,Gangtie Yanjiu Xuebao,Journal of Iron and Steel Research International,,Control Model of Multifunctional Hot Metal Ladles,,Control model - Distribution models - Hot metal - Iron making - Operation process - Supply and demand - Supply and demand balances - Turnover number,23

The tobacco AO gene consists of a 1722-bp open reading frame and encodes a protein of 573 amino acids. Sequence comparison analysis revealed that the tobacco AO protein shares high homology with the AO proteins of Lycopersicon esculentum (89%), Populus trichocarpa (75%), soybean (74%), castor bean (73%) and peach (73%). The prediction of transmembrane helices showed that tobacco AO might be a transmembrane protein.

Electr. Power Comp. Syst.,"Estimating the moisture content of insulation paper is important in transformer condition evaluation, the results of which are affected by thermal aging. This study investigates the independent effects of aged oil and aged paper on moisture equilibrium charts to determine which of the two primarily causes the inaccuracy in moisture estimation of aged transformers. A thermal aging experiment was conducted. At five aging degrees, four kinds of oil-paper insulation systems were formed: new oil-new paper, aged oil-new paper, new oil-aged paper, and aged oil-aged paper. Moisture equilibrium curves were drawn for each insulation system. The relative moisture content of oil and that of paper were calculated. Results showed that the moisture content of insulation paper decreased with aging, which led to the migration of the moisture equilibrium curves and further influenced the moisture estimation results. A comparative analysis showed that the migration of the moisture equilibrium curves was mainly caused by aged paper at the early and middle aging stages and by the synergistic effects of aged paper and aged oil at the late aging stage. The effects of aging on moisture distribution were verified using a retired transformer. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,20161302143731,,"Liao, Ruijin (1); Lin, Yuandi (1); Zhang, Yiyi (1, 2); Xia, Huanhuan (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China (2) Guangxi Key Laboratory of Power System Optimization and Energy Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, China (3) Yunnan Electric Power Research Institute (Group) Co.

J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci.,"In order to fully utilize mineral resources and improve the metal recovery from tailings, the leaching performance of copper and silver by various chemical agents, the technological parameters and dynamics in ammonia leaching were investigated. It was concluded that ammonia leaching was effective and feasible. The results show that the maximum leaching rate of copper and silver is 57% and 56.69%, respectively at the ammonia concentration of 6 mol/l and the solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:4. The dynamics in ammonia leaching shows that the leaching of copper and silver conforms to 'unreacted core shrinkage model' when the temperature ranges from 293 K to 323 K. The leaching is controlled by several factors but mainly by the procedure of internal diffusion. The apparent activation energy of copper and silver by leaching is 26.22 KJ/mol and 27.5 KJ/mol, respectively after fitting. The comprehensive utilization of copper and silver from tailings was investigated to serve as a reliable theoretical basis for the company to efficiently recover copper and silver from tailings, which not only reduces the waste of resources but promotes the company's economic benefit. © Copyright 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",,20163102675668,,"Yuan, Liwei (1); Peng, Xiao (1); Li, Sumin (1); Chen, Yuming (1) ","(1) Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",,544.1 Copper - 547.1 Precious Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Activation energy - Ammonia - Copper - Dynamics - Leaching - Mineral resources - Recovery - Shrinkage - Silver,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Sumin ",10.1166/jctn.2016.4636,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15461963,,,,15461955,4.0,April 2016,English,Metal recovery,,12.0,2671-2676,,2016,American Scientific Publishers,Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience,,Dynamic tests on recovering copper silver metal from tailings,,Ammonia concentrations - Ammonia leaching - Apparent activation energy - Chemical leaching - Comprehensive utilizations - Internal diffusion - Solid-to-liquid ratio - Technological parameters,13
Carbohydr Polym,"Cross-linked cellulose microspheres (CL-CMs) were successfully prepared by inverse crosslinking suspension method. NaOH/urea aqueous solution was used as solvent to dissolve cellulose at low temperature. The microspheres presented good spherical shape and monodispersity, which were applied to synthesize endotoxin adsorbent with polymyxin B (PMB) as ligand. The adsorbent showed good adsorption capability on endotoxin in physiologic saline solution and the maximum adsorption capacity was 3605 EU/g (1EU = 100 pg). It was worth noting that more than 70% of endotoxin could be effectively removed from the human plasma with the initial concentration of endotoxin ranged from 1 EU/mL to 5 EU/mL. The dynamic adsorption efficiency of endotoxin was 72.3% at the plasma perfusion rate of 300 mL/h with the endotoxin concentration of 4 EU/mL, while the variation of plasma protein before and after adsorption was only 8.9%. It suggests that the PMB immobilized CL-CMs have great potential application in clinical blood purification. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrochim Acta,"Cd doped porous Co3O4nanosheets were successfully synthesized via a facile chemical coprecipitation method without using of surfactant or template. The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2adsorption/desorption isotherms (BET) and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) for their composition, structure/morphology, and BET surface area, respectively. The nanosheets consisting of nanoparticles prepared here are porous in nature, with average pore sizes of approximately 50 nm or smaller. The electrochemical properties of the Cd doped porous Co3O4nanosheets were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 6 mol/L KOH solution. The 5% Cd doped porous Co3O4nanosheets electrode shows the maximum specific capacitance as high as 737 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, which is 69% higher than that of the undoped porous Co3O4nanosheets electrode. Furthermore, it has good specific capacitance retention of ca. 96% after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. It shows a better cyclic stability than undoped porous Co3O4nanosheets electrode, indicating that the Cd doped porous Co3O4nanosheets is a promising electroactive material for supercapacitor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Gao Xiao Hua Xue Gong Cheng Xue Bao,"Titanium dioxide production by sulfuric acid processes usually results in the formation of ferrous sulfate. This study used crystallization to purify ferrous sulfate. The impurity segmentation and mass transfer were investigated, and the effects of crystallization time and stirring speed on purification were studied. A numerical model of crystallization purification was proposed based on the solid-liquid boundary layer theory of impurity diffusion. The experimental results indicate that the impurities (Mn, Mg, Zn, Ni) are effectively removed, and the numerical model can be used to predict impurity concentration, especially for impurities with low concentration. The crystallization process is found to be affected by stirring due to the change of the solid-liquid boundary lay between crystal and solution, and thus affects the impurity segmentation, which proves the mass transfer process of impurity. © 2016, Editorial Board of “Journal of Chemical Engineering of Chinese Universities”.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Context. We show the benefits of using electron-multiplying CCDs and the shift-and-add technique as a tool to minimise the effects of atmospheric turbulence, such as blending between stars in crowded fields, and to avoid saturated stars in the fields observed. We intend to complete, or improve on, the census of the variable star population in globular cluster NGC 6715. Aims. Our aim is to obtain high-precision time-series photometry of the very crowded central region of this stellar system via the collection of better angular resolution images than has been previously achieved with conventional CCDs on ground-based telescopes. Methods. Observations were carried out using the Danish 1.54-m telescope at the ESO La Silla observatory in Chile. The telescope is equipped with an electron-multiplying CCD that enables short-exposure-time images to be obtained (ten images per second) that were stacked using the shift-and-add technique to produce the normal-exposure-time images (minutes). The high precision photometry was performed via difference image analysis employing the DanDIA pipeline. We attempted automatic detection of variable stars in the field. Results. We statistically analysed the light curves of 1405 stars in the crowded central region of NGC 6715 to automatically identify the variable stars present in this cluster. We found light curves for 17 previously known variable stars near the edges of our reference image (16 RR Lyrae and 1 semi-regular) and we discovered 67 new variables (30 RR Lyrae, 21 irregular (long-period type), 3 semi-regular, 1 W Virginis, 1 eclipsing binary, and 11 unclassified).

Dalton Trans.,"A single-phased Mn4+doped fluorozirconate red phosphor, K3ZrF7:Mn4+, has been successfully synthesized. Its structure, morphology, composition and optical properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and by using luminescence decay curves. It was found that Mn4+ions only coordinating with seven F-anions in a K3ZrF7crystal field can possess intense red emission under blue light illumination. Mixing the obtained K3ZrF7:Mn4+red phosphor with commercial Y3Al5O12:Ce3+and coating the mixture on a blue-GaN chip, obvious warm white light with a low correlated color temperature (2970 K) and a high color rendering index (Ra= 91.4 and R9= 72) were achieved from white light-emitting diode devices. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20162402503857,,"Tan, Huiying (1); Rong, Meizhu (2); Zhou, Yayun (1); Yang, Zhiyu (1); Wang, Zhengliang (1); Zhang, Qiuhan (1); Wang, Qin (2); Zhou, Qiang (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Comprehensive Utilization of Mineral Resource in Ethnic Regions, Jt.

Colloids Surf. A Physicochem. Eng. Asp.,"A nonenzymatic electrochemical immunosensor based on the silver at mesoporous (denoted as Ag at MSN) nanoparticles was developed for the detection of microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR). Classical electrochemical immunosensor usually employs protein enzymes as biocatalysts to afford amplified signals. However, enzymes are vulnerable to proteolytic degradation, suffering from poor stability. Ag at MSN nanoparticle which possessed an intrinsic enzyme catalytic activity similar to that of horseradish peroxidase was used to replace protein enzyme to improve the stability and sensitivity. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the nonenzymatic immunosensor exhibits excellent performance (e.g., a detection limit of 0. 2. ng/mL, a linear dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude, high specificity). With these merits, this stable, simple, sensitive and low-cost nonenzymatic electrochemical immunoassay shows promise for applications in food and environmental monitoring. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",,20155001666579,,"Zhao, Chunling (1); Hu, Rong (1, 2); Liu, Tingzhi (1); Liu, Yi (1); Bai, Ruyan (1); Zhang, Kunlei (1); Yang, Yunhui (1) ","(1) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China (2) State Key Laboratory for Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha; 410082, China ",CPEAEH,461.9 Biology - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Amino acids - Catalyst activity - Electrochemistry - Enzyme activity - Immunosensors - Nanoparticles,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Yunhui(yyhui2002@aliyun.com) ",10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.11.051,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734359,"Number: 20975034, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21465026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21275044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21165023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: J1210040, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21177036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2011CB911000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 21165023 , 21465026 , J1210040 , 20975034 , 21177036 , 21275044 ), the National Key Scientific Program of China ( 2011CB911000 ).",,09277757,,"February 05, 2016",English,Toxic materials,,32.0,336-342,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,,A non-enzymatic electrochemical immunosensor for microcystin-LR rapid detection based on Ag at MSN nanoparticles,,Electrochemical immunoassays - Electrochemical immunosensors - Environmental Monitoring - Experimental conditions - Horse-radish peroxidase - Microcystin-LR - Non-enzymatic - Real samples,490
Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong,"To implement uncertain QoS-aware Web service selection under the circumstance of the deficiency of user's precise utility function and the unknown of QoS probability distribution forms, an admissible composition plans based on stochastic dominance theory was proposed to discover the function class which were compatible with the user utility. According to the expected utility theory, the admissible composition plans could not be dominated by any others. By eliminating the services or intermediate composition plans which were included in the admissible set, the search space in finding the admissible set was significantly reduced. Moreover, a heap-based composition plan extracting and expanding process was developed based on the properties of stochastic dominance, so that the numbers of stochastic dominance tests were reduced. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method were verified by theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental research based on real datasets of Web service QoS. © 2016, CIMS.

Minerals Eng,"In this study, a new approach 'sulfur-oil agglomeration' for gold flotation was put forward to recover gold particles in laboratory and industrial scale experiments. The optimum recovery of gold was obtained by adding (NH4)2S2O3, oil emulsions and sulfur into the mill, together with butyl xanthate as the collector in weak acidic pulp adjusted by H2SO4. Fundamental concepts of gold flotation were considered, including the sulfur-oil-gold agglomeration mechanisms and the role of (NH4)2S2O3. The possible mechanism had been put forward: (1) nature of (NH4)2S2O3is complex, it renders the oxidized gold surface cleaned, the exposed fresh surface shows strong natural oleophilicity; (2) in weak acidic pulp, S decomposed from (NH4)2S2O3, a highly hydrophobic/oleophilic material, agglomerated with gold; (3) then the oil droplets overspread the gold surfaces and the collision of these oil wetted particles caused formation of 'liquid bridges' each upon them. As a result, the fine gold particles in the beginning were converted to the masses in the form of sulfur-gold-oil which were bonded together by liquid bridges. Meanwhile, the sulfur could strengthen the adsorption of collectors on gold surface, as well as the floating size range of gold is widen, and the recovery of gold is significantly improved. Industrial trials conducted at Yunnan, China showed that an average gold recovery of 87.39% into a concentrate assaying 25.84 g/t Au from a feed of 1.8-3.0 g/t could be achieved by the aid of sulfur-oil agglomeration method. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Gongcheng Kexue Xuebao,"In this work, microwave energy was used for roasting treatment of diaspora bauxite mixed with saturated NaOH solution as an additive. The influences of microwave heating temperature and NaOH addition on the phase transformation of the diaspora ore-sodium hydroxide system were investigated. The phase constitution of the roasted ore in microwave heating and conventional heating processes was compared under the same experimental conditions. The phase composition and microstructure of the roasted ore were comparatively analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that microwave roasting can facilitate the rapid and complete reaction between NaOH and the diaspore ore, leading to more NaAlO2phase forming at lower temperature as compared to conventional heating. After microwave heating, the roasted ore is porous, good for subsequent digestion processes. © All right reserved.",,20161402193801,,"Le, Thi-Quynh-Xuan (1, 2, 3); Ju, Shao-Hua (1, 2, 3); Peng, Jin-Hui (1, 2); Wang, Shi-Xing (1, 2, 3); Zhou, Lie-Xing (1, 2) ","(1) National Local Joint Laboratory of Engineering Application of Microwave Energy and Equipment Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",,533.1 Ore Treatment - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Aluminum compounds - Calcination - Microwaves - Ore analysis - Ore roasting - Ores - Phase transitions - Scanning electron microscopy - Sodium Aluminate - Sodium hydroxide - X ray diffraction analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ju, Shao-Hua(shj_200801@126.com) ",10.13374/j.issn2095-9389.2016.02.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,20959389,2.0,"February 1, 2016",Chinese,Microwave heating,,15.0,187-193,,2016,Science Press,Gongcheng Kexue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Engineering,,Phase transformation of the diasporic bauxite-sodium hydroxide system in microwave heating,,Bauxite - Conventional heating - Diasporic-bauxite - Digestion process - Experimental conditions - Lower temperatures - Microwave energies - Phase constitution,38
Qiche Gongcheng,"With the simplified mechanism of n-heptane/toluene/n-hexene compound as the chemical reaction kinetics mechanism of diesel fuel combustion, a 3D CFD numerical model for a high-pressure common-rail diesel engine is built by applying CFD software coupled with chemical kinetics mechanism. Using the coupled model built, with the atmospheric environment (16.2% O2+83.8% N2in volume fraction) at 3000 meters above sea level as reference, the effects of different volumetric blending proportions (1.6%, 4.8% and 8%) of various intake gas constituents (O2, H2, CO2and gaseous H2O) on the combustion process of engine are comparatively simulated. The results show that with O2blended, the starting point of combustion advances, the proportion of premixed combustion and the peak heat-release-rate reduce, the concentration of active radicals (OH, O) in cylinder rise and NO emission significantly increases while soot emission decreases dramatically; With H2added, the heat release rate sharply increases, in-cylinder pressure and peak temperature rise, and NO emission slightly increases while soot emission deceases a bit; The blending of CO2leads to the latest ignition timing, the lowest in-cylinder pressure and peak temperature, the longest consumption reaction duration of A4and C2H2, the least NO generation and the highest soot emission; And when gaseous H2O is added, NO emission slightly reduces and soot emission has little change. © 2016, SAE-China.

Electron. J. Geotech. Eng.,"Through the shaking table test, this paper proposes a conclusion about the failure process of layer slopes under earthquake with different structures and lithology. Meanwhile, by using the transfer function of white noise signal input, the first modal damping of side slope model was deduced. The relationship between the damping ratio change and the model structure during the damage process of the model was analyzed. The test results indicate that the instability mechanism of four types of slope under earthquake can be concluded as: The hard rock bedding slope is caused by bedding slope drift - bottom collapse and bending instability. The hard rock anti-dipping slope is caused by trailing edge pull apart and middle-bottom part shear and slide type instability. The soft rock bedding slope results from bedding slope drift - bottom extrude - layer slip instability. The soft rock anti-dipping slope results from bending-located and shear type instability. Additionally, the dump change characteristic of the side slope model indicates that larger first modal damping changing happens in hard rock structure. As the earthquake becomes stronger, the damping of slope system will increase sharply in the development of failure surface. However, the damping ratio change characteristic of the soft rock slope is relatively gentle, which means the soft rock is less sensitive to the strength of the earthquake. The abrupt damping ratio change of the anti-dipping slope indicates the structural alternation of which is more obvious during an earthquake. Which gives a good explanation that why more earthquakes have occurred in hard rock slopes and why the earthquakes were stronger in anti-dipping slopes, as shown in 5.12 Wenchuan earthquake, 2008. © 2016 ejge.",,20163802817553,,"Li, Guo (1); Fang, Rui (1); Li, YaJun (1); Ju, Nengpan (2) ","(1) Broadvision Engineering consultants, National Engineering Laboratory for Surface Transportation Weather Impact Prevention, Kunming, Yunnan; 650041, China (2) Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu; 610059, China ",,481.1 Geology - 481.3 Geophysics - 484 Seismology - 921 Mathematics - 931.1 Mechanics,,,,,Damping - Dynamic response - Dynamics - Earthquakes - Geophysics - Lithology - Rocks - Stability - White noise,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Guo(ziltch2002@163.com) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10893032,"Number: U1402231, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work in this paper was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Yunnan United Fund: Study on mechanical mechanism of landslide induced by environmental and engineering factors in Yunnan area""(No. U1402231).""",,,12.0,2016,English,Transfer functions,,20.0,4435-4452,,2016,E-Journal of Geotechnical Engineering,Electronic Journal of Geotechnical Engineering,,Dynamic response characteristics of layer structure slope based on transfer function analysis,,Bending instability - Different structure - Dynamic response characteristics - Instability mechanisms - Layer structures - Shaking table tests - Transfer function analysis - Wenchuan Earthquake,21
Appl Surf Sci,"An innovative approach is proposed to texture a pyramid structure on a silicon surface via Cu-catalyzed chemical etching in the HF/FeCl3 system. The surface and cross-section morphologies of the formed pyramid structure were examined by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The results revealed that numerous silicon pyramid-like structures with hemlines of 0.1 ∼ 3 μm and height of 0.1 ∼ 2 μm are close together, and the top angle of the pyramid structure is 90°. Additionally, the systematic study of the effects of the etching time and the concentration of FeCl3 on the pyramid-like structures by the atom configuration model of silicon crystal faces demonstrated that the etching proceeds preferentially along the directions of silicon. A formation mechanism of the pyramid-like structure is proposed. The results imply that the synergetic effect of Cu nanoparticles and Fe(III) could conveniently generate a pyramid-like architecture on the surface of silicon in hydrofluoric acid solution. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By the combination of multi-granulation rough sets and the single-granulation dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets, we then develop a new multi-granulation rough set model, called a multi-granulation dual hesitant fuzzy rough set. In the multi-granulation framework, two types of multi-granulation dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets are proposed, which are named the optimistic multi-granulation dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets and pessimistic multi-granulation dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets. Finally, the relationships among the single-granulation dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets, optimistic multi-granulation dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets and pessimistic multi-granulation dual hesitant fuzzy rough sets are investigated. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Org. Electron,"Thin-films of Zinc Tin Oxide (ZTO) with an extremely high charge carrier mobility and superior optical transmittance are synthesized using a simple solution method. These ZTO films have been systematically studied for the application in inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). The Hall effects measurements show that the charge mobility of the ZTO semiconductor is over 16.5 cm2.V-1.S-1, which is the highest mobility value ever reported for oxide buffer made by using solution process. By applying the ZTO buffer layer in the inverted PSCs of P3HT:PC61BM, the power conversion efficiency of the device is 30% higher than that of the devices made with other common buffer layers such as ZnO and TiO2. Light intensity-dependent JV studies and PL measurements also indicate that ZTO buffer layer reduces surface recombination.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"In this study, we report a ratiometric fluorescent probe (CZBI) for sulfur dioxide (SO2) derivatives based on the conjugate of carbazole and benzo[e]indolium, which displays colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescence dual response to HSO3-. The probe can quantitatively detect HSO3-with high specificity, fast response (within 40s) as well as low detection limit (10nM). A 1,4-nucleophilic addition reaction was proposed for the sensing mechanism of this probe, which was confirmed by1H NMR and HR-MS spectra. Fluorescence co-localization studies demonstrated that CZBI was a specific mitochondria-targeted fluorescent probe for SO2derivatives with excellent cell membrane permeability. Furthermore, fluorescence imaging of HeLa cells indicated that CZBI could be used for monitoring the intrinsically generated intracellular SO2derivatives in living cells by ratiometric fluorescence imaging. Thus, CZBI has a great potential application for exploring the role played by SO2derivatives in biology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20154401463850,,"Xu, Junchao (1); Pan, Jian (1); Jiang, Xiaoming (1); Qin, Caiqin (2); Zeng, Lintao (1); Zhang, Huan (1); Zhang, Jun Feng (3) ","(1) School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin; 300384, China (2) Department of Chemistry and Material Sciences, Hubei Engineering University, Xiaogan; 432000, China (3) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",BBIOE4,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 746 Imaging Techniques - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Addition reactions - Cytology - Fluorescence spectroscopy - Imaging techniques - Lanthanum compounds - Probes - Sulfur dioxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zeng, Lintao(zlt1981@126.com) ",10.1016/j.bios.2015.10.049,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,"Number: 2014HB008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21302165, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Aeronautical Science Foundation of China; Number: 21262050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Aeronautical Science Foundation of China; Number: 13JCQNJC05300, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City; Number: 21203138, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31371750, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","L.Z. and C.Q. thank the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21203138 , 31371750 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin ( 13JCQNJC05300 ).

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"Generalized method of moment (GMM) is an important estimation method for econometric models. However, it is highly sensitive to the outliers and influential observations. This paper studies the detection of influential observations using GMM estimation and establishes some useful diagnostic tools, such as residual and leverage measures. The case deletion technique is employed to derive diagnostic measures. Under linear moment conditions, an exact deletion formula is derived, and under nonlinear moment condition an approximate formula is suggested. The results are applied to efficient instrumental variable estimation and dynamic panel data models. In addition, generalized residuals and leverage measure for GMM estimator are defined and discussed. Two real data sets are used for illustration and a simulation study is conducted to confirm the usefulness of the proposed methodology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20154801617581,,"Shi, Lei (1, 3); Lu, Jun (1); Zhao, Jianhua (1); Chen, Gemai (2) ","(1) Statistics and Mathematics School, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (2) Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Calgary, Calgary; AB; T2N 1N4, Canada (3) Yunnan TongChuang Scientific Computing and Data Mining Center, Kunming; 650221, China ",CSDADW,921 Mathematics,,,,,Approximation algorithms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shi, Lei(shi_lei65@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.csda.2015.10.003,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 61403337, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11161053, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11361071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1302267, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to thank the Associate Editor and the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions that greatly improved the paper.

Groundwater,"A solution conduit has a permeable wall allowing for water exchange and solute transfer between the conduit and its surrounding aquifer matrix. In this paper, we use Laplace Transform to solve a one-dimensional equation constructed using the Euler approach to describe advective transport of solute in a conduit, a production-value problem. Both nonuniform cross-section of the conduit and nonuniform seepage at the conduit wall are considered in the solution. Physical analysis using the Lagrangian approach and a lumping method is performed to verify the solution. Two-way transfer between conduit water and matrix water is also investigated by using the solution for the production-value problem as a first-order approximation. The approximate solution agrees well with the exact solution if dimensionless travel time in the conduit is an order of magnitude smaller than unity. Our analytical solution is based on the assumption that the spatial and/or temporal heterogeneity in the wall solute flux is the dominant factor in the spreading of spring-breakthrough curves, and conduit dispersion is only a secondary mechanism. Such an approach can lead to the better understanding of water exchange and solute transfer between conduits and aquifer matrix.

Org. Geochem.,"Gram-negative bacterial 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OH-FAs) biomarkers are widespread in a variety of environments including both marine and terrestrial sediments (including speleothems). In this study we analysed the hydroxylated membrane lipids of 26 soil samples from an altitudinal transect of Shennongjia Mountain in central China to study the environmental factors controlling the relative distribution of 3-OH-FAs. Our results show that both the ratio of the summed iso and anteiso to the total amount of normal 3-OH-FAs (RIAN), and the ratio of summed iso and anteiso to the total amount of all 3-OH-FAs (Branched Index) were primarily related to the pH of soil (R2= 0.70 and 0.70, respectively). Additionally, the anteiso to normal 3-hydroxy fatty acids ratio of the C15and C17homologues (RAN15and RAN17) shows a significant negative correlation with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) (R2= 0.51 and 0.48, respectively). When comparing the 3-OH-FA based indices with established glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) based indices from the same soil samples, the RIAN and Branched Index show strong linear correlations with the cyclisation ratio of branched tetraethers (CBT) (R2= 0.77 and 0.74, respectively), and the RAN15and RAN17show negative correlations with the MBT/CBT-MAAT (MBT, methylation index of branched tetraethers) (R2= 0.61 and 0.36, respectively). Our new field-based correlations demonstrate the physiological response of Gram-negative bacterial cell membranes to the external environment and suggest that 3-hydroxy fatty acids can be applied in palaeoenvironmental studies to estimate past MAAT and soil pH. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20160701914371,,"Wang, Canfa (1, 2); Bendle, James (2); Yang, Yi (1); Yang, Huan (1); Sun, Huiling (3); Huang, Junhua (4); Xie, Shucheng (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; 430074, China (2) School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham; B15 2TT, United Kingdom (3) Key Laboratory of Plateau Lake Ecology and Global Change, College of Tourism and Geography, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (4) State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; 430074, China ",ORGEDE,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Alkylation - Cytology - Glycerol - Lipids - Physiological models - Soil surveys - Soils - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xie, Shucheng(xiecug@163.com) ",10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.01.010,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: DIF, Sponsor: Diabetes Institutes Foundation; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: University of Birmingham; Number: B08030, Acronym: MOE, Sponsor: Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Number: 201306410031, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: -, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: 41330103, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41130207, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41201203, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41330103 , 41130207 , 41201203 ), and the 111 Project ( National Bureau of Foreign Experts and the Ministry of Education of China ; Grant No. B08030 ).

IOP Conf. Ser. Earth Environ. Sci.,"Mining-induced geo-hazards have caused enormous destruction and threat to mines. Known as the 'kingdom of nonferrous metals' and located in Southwest China, Yunnan Province developed mining-induced geo-hazards well with characteristics of multiple types, widespread distribution and serious damage. Landslides and debris flows are two common sub-types of geohazards causing most serious damage in Yunnan, and some of them were very representative in the world. Two landslides and two debris flows were chosen to analyze deeply. Both Laojinshan Landslide and Sunjiaqing Landslide possess the characteristic of rock avalanches. The high sliding speed and long distance made the landslides translate into clastic flows with impact force and caused enormous destruction. Rainstorm and mining waste rock were two main factors to induce debris flows in Yunnan mines. Heishan valley debris flow of Dongchuan copper mine was a super large rainstorm type viscose debris flow with very low frequency, which brought a good caution to utilize valleys which looked an unlikely debris flow. Nandagou Valley of Jinding lead-zinc mine in Lanping County was a rainstorm stimulating, gully-type, high frequency and large scale debris flow, which was induced by mining activities.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"With the wide use of mobile devices, spatial crowdsourcing platforms are becoming popular. An important problem of spatial crowdsourcing is assigning a set of spatial tasks tagged with location and time for workers according to their location. In most cases, existing approaches usually take the matching algorithm as a fundamental step to solve this problem which aims to maximize the number of completed tasks. However, in the present of many spatial crowdsourcing platforms, how to assign the tasks at high efficiency and make a relatively fair schedule for multiple workers is a new challenge. In this paper, we study the problem of load balancing based task scheduling for multiple workers. We present fast and effective approximate algorithms for task scheduling problem. With both real and synthetic datasets, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,20164803051843,,"Sun, Dezhi (1); Gao, Yong (2); Yu, Dan (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, Beihang University, Beijing, China (2) Key Laboratory of Yunnan Province Universities of the Diversity and Ecological Adaptive Evolution for Animals and Plants on YunGui Plateau, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; Yunnan, China (3) China Standard Software Co., Ltd., Beijing, China ",,722.4 Digital Computers and Systems,185699.0,"June 3, 2016 - June 5, 2016","Nanchang, China","17th International Conference on Web-Age Information Management, WAIM 2016",Crowdsourcing - Information management - Multitasking - Problem solving,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Sun, Dezhi(csusun12@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-47121-1_14,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319471204.0,03029743,,2016,English,Scheduling algorithms,"Web-Age Information Management - WAIM 2016 International Workshops MWDA, SDMMW, and SemiBDMA, Revised Selected Papers",21.0,161-173,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Efficient and load balancing strategy for task scheduling in spatial crowdsourcing,,Approximate algorithms - Crowdsourcing platforms - High-efficiency - Load balancing strategy - Matching algorithm - Synthetic datasets - Task scheduling problem - Task-scheduling,9998 LNCS

Neiranji Xuebao,"In a common-rail diesel engine, the effects of different intake components (O2, CO2and H2) and injection timing on its working process, were studied by coupling three-dimensional CFD model with the simplified kinetic mechanism of the mixture (n-heptane/toluene/1-hexene). Results showed that, for all intake components, when advancing injection timing, active free radicals (OH, O) and their distribution region, as well as NO increase simultaneously. But when injection timing is advanced too early, ignition delay, heat release rate, and the peaks of incylinder pressure and temperature decrease, thus reducing NO. Compared with other intake components, when O2is added into intake charge, concentration of O radical increases, soot and the effects of injection timing on its formation reduce; with H2addition into the intake charge, the peaks of in-cylinder pressure and temperature are the highest, OH distribution is the largest, and soot reduces significantly with the advanced injection timing; with CO2addition into the intake charge, the peaks of in-cylinder pressure and temperature are the lowest, O and OH radicals are the least. When injection timing is advanced beyond 24° CA BTDC, fuel is injected into the compression clearance volume gradually, which leads to local fuel-rich region. As a result, C2H2and A4increase, meanwhile, soot increases greatly when injection timing is further advanced. © 2016, Chinese Society for Internal Combustion Engines.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"In order to establish a rapid method for discriminating Boletus edulis mushroom, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combined with multivariate statistical analysis were used to study B. edulis which were collected from different origins and different years. The original infrared spectra of all the 152 B. edulis samples collected from 2011 to 2014 and 26 different areas of Yunnan Province were optimized with orthogonal signal correction and wavelet compression (OSCW) method. The spectral data that before and after being preprocessed with OSCW were analyzed with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The classification results of PLS-DA were compared. Then the 152 B. edulis samples were randomly divided into a training set (120) and a validation set (32) to establish the PLS classification prediction model. The results showed that, after OSCW processing, the classification result of PLS-DA was significantly better than the other one which was not processed by OSCW. Principal component score plot can accurately distinguish B. edulis samples collected from different years and different origins. It indicated that OSCW can effectively eliminate the noise of spectra and reduce the unrelated interference information about the dependent variables to improve the accuracy and calculation speed of spectral analysis. Before OSCW preprocessed, the R2and RMSEE of PLS model of the training set were 0.790 1 and 21.246 5 respectively while R2and RMSEP of the model of validation set were 0.922 5 and 14.429 2. After OSCW pretreatment, R2and RMSEE of the training set were 0.852 3 and 17.238 1 while R2and RMSEP of validation set were 0.845 4 and 20.87. It suggested that OSCW could improve the predictive effect of the training set, but the over-fitting of OSCW-PLS may reduce the predictive ability of validation set. Therefore, it was unsuitable to establish a model with OSCW combined with PLS. In a conclusion, OSCW combined with PLS-DA can eliminate a large amount of spectrum interference information. This method could accurately distinguish B. edulis samples collected from different years and different origins. It could provide a reliable basis for the discrimination and classification of wild edible fungi. © 2016, Peking University Press.

Guangxue Jingmi Gongcheng,"Specific to disadvantage of current image and 3D scanning method difficult to make effective and rapid traceability shearing tool through trace, a set of laser detection signal traceability system with shearing trace was designed and realized; The system consists of three parts including motion control subsystem, laser detection subsystem and microscopic imaging subsystem. Through clamping cable breakage, firstly, single point laser displacement sensor was controlled to pickup surface characteristic signal of linear trace of shearing; secondly, wavelet decomposition was used to carry out noise reduction for pickup signal and obtain the signal after noise reduction. Variance diversity factor among signals was adopted to perform similarity coincidence degree matching of trace characteristic; and gradient descent method was used to implement parameter machine learning, and construct the corresponding cost function; by constant iteration, make cost function value minimum and finally realize the rapid traceability of shearing tool. System efficiency was verified through the actual shearing traces and multiple sample matching test. Batch traceability test for 25 groups of test data based on 1 000 groups of samples was put forward. Experiment results show that total time consuming is about 1.5 s; correct traceability rate is 98%; the experiment proves that this system has accuracy and validity for laser detection signal traceability system with shearing trace. © 2016, Science Press.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Mechatronics Autom., IEEE ICMA","Frequency response method was used to detect the power transformer winding deformation with the changing of peaks and troughs and frequency spectrum frequency in the curves of high middle lower spectrum. Some types of winding deformation was similar in the reflection of frequency curve. It would lead to the mistake results in the judgment of deformation by the reason of without the quantitative judgment. The paper came up with the SVM method in detecting the type of power transformer winding deformation, which can improve the recognition accuracy and efficiency of winding deformation. In order to set up the SVM model accurately of power transformer winding deformation recognition. Firstly the paper made choice of the characteristic, which could inflect the overall frequency response curve characteristic quantities. Secondly, the three types fault of the power transformer winding, including axis offsetting, picture to the deformation, winding changing between bread, chose the appropriate training samples and testing samples.

Mater Chem Phys,"An easy, inexpensive combustion route was designed to synthesize hierarchically porous WO3. The tungsten source was fresh peroxiotungstic acid by dissolving tungsten powder into hydrogen peroxide. To promote the combustion reaction, a combined fuel of both glycine and hydrazine hydrate was used. The microstructure was well-connected pores comprised of subunit nanoparticles. Upon exposing towards acetone gas, the porous WO3based sensor exhibits high gas response, rapid response and recovery, and good selectivity in the range of 5–1000 ppm under working temperature of 300 °C. This excellent sensing performance was plausibly attributed to the porous morphology, which hence provides more active sites for the gas molecules' reaction. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20164603017811,,"Dong, Chengjun (1); Liu, Xu (1); Guan, Hongtao (1); Chen, Gang (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1); Djerdj, Igor (2); Wang, Yude (1, 3) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Ruer Bokovi Institute, Bijenika 54, Zagreb; 10000, Croatia (3) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Mico-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",MCHPDR,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Acetone - Amino acids - Combustion - Electron microscopy - Emission spectroscopy - Nitrogen compounds - Oxides - Photoelectron spectroscopy - Synthesis (chemical),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2016.09.036,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: ZD2013006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 7/13, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Unity Avenue Foundation; Number: 2015Y008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51262029 ), the Key Project of the Department of Education of Yunnan Province ( ZD2013006 ) and the Project of the Department of Education of Yunnan Province ( 2015Y008 ).

Meitan Xuebao,"In the engineering construction, the rock mass is often under cycle loading-unloading. The prediction of the rock damage under cycle load-unloading has an important practical significance. Two different cyclic stress paths are set to study the acoustic emission characteristics of the Yunnan white marble under cycle loading-unloading. The study shows that: during the unloading phase there is no apparent acoustic emission in the early stage, the acoustic emission appears during the intermission period. The change trend of the Felicity value is relatively consistent under the different stress paths: the Felicity values gradually reduce with the increase of stress level. The Felicity values of the stress limit constant load-unloading scheme are relatively lower than the stress difference constant load-unloading scheme, which shows that the first scheme causes more serious damage to the rock. The b value can be divided into three parts during the whole cycle loading: the b value decreases with the increase of stress when the rock is under lower stress level, and then the b value fluctuates within certain extent showing that the cracks within the rock goes through a relatively stability development period. Before the rock damage, the b value shows a certain degree of increase. In a single cycle unloading the b value presents a V-shaped distribution and the b value has a dramatic change before the destruction of rock. b value and Felicity value have a certain consistency and diversity, the use of the combination of these values can improve the accuracy of rock damage prediction. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of China Coal Society.

J Wuhan Univ Technol Mater Sci Ed,"Walnut-shell activated carbons (WSACs) were prepared by the KOH chemical activation. The effects of carbonization temperature, activation temperature, and ratio of KOH to chars on the pore development of WSACs were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the microstructure and morphology of WSACs. Methanol adsorption performance onto the optimal WSAC and the coal-based AC were also investigated. The results show that the optimal preparation conditions are a carbonization temperature of 700 °C, an activation temperature of 700 °C, and a mass ratio of 3. The BET surface area, the micropore volume, and the micropore volume percentage of the optimal WASC are 1636 m2/g, 0.641 cm3/g and 81.97%, respectively. There are a lot of micropores and a certain amount of meso- and macropores. The characteristics of the amorphous state are identified. The results show that the optimal WSAC is favorable for methanol adsorption. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of the optimal WSAC is 248.02mg/g. It is shown that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the optimal WSAC is almost equivalent to that of the common activated carbon. Therefore the optimal WSAC could be a potential adsorbent for the solar energy adsorption refrigeration cycle. © 2016, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20161602268748,,"Yu, Qiongfen (1); Li, Ming (1); Ji, Xu (1); Qiu, Yu (1); Zhu, Yuntao (1); Leng, Congbin (1) ","(1) Solar Energy Research Institute, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",JWUTE8,"644.1 Refrigeration Methods - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Activated carbon - Adsorption - Carbonization - Characterization - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Methanol - Microporosity - Potassium hydroxide - Refrigeration - Scanning electron microscopy - Solar energy - X ray powder diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Ming(lmllldy@126.com) ",10.1007/s11595-016-1362-3,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19930437,,,,10002413,2.0,"April 1, 2016",English,Chemical activation,,36.0,260-268,,2016,Wuhan Ligong Daxue,"Journal Wuhan University of Technology, Materials Science Edition",,Characterization and methanol adsorption of walnut-shell activated carbon prepared by KOH activation,,Activation temperatures - Carbonization temperatures - Energy adsorption - Equilibrium adsorption capacity - Methanol adsorption - Potential adsorbents - Preparation conditions - Walnut shells,31

However, due to the high production rate and diversity of log data, it still is a big challenge to store and analyze them. Applying distributed storage and parallel computing in the clusters can improve the respond speed of searching and analyzing big data. In this work, we design a platform which integrates some distributed storage and parallel computing technologies i.e. Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Flume etc. to collect, store and analyze the mass log data. Moreover, the platform can timely display analysis results in graphical format through integrating some traditional technologies. The experimental results show that combining Flume and Hive is reliable and flexible in collecting and storing log data.

"Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Commun. Softw. Netw., ICCSN","With the development of computer vision technology, it is possible to use different algorithms to detect and locate specific targets. Locally adaptive regression kernels (LARK), which is a method for rapid detection and localization of specific targets, is a kind of image analysis method without training, and can be used to search for specific target images quickly. It operates using a single example of an object as a query image to find similar matching in a target image. Firstly, features are preliminarily extracted from the query image using the local steering kernels as descriptors, and then salient features are further extracted using locality preserving projection (LPP). And then the comparison between the target image and the query image is done using the cosine similarity criterion to find all possible similar objects. Finally, the non-maxima suppression method is used to preserve the most similar objects, so as to achieve the detection and localization of the specific target. In this paper, we choose the different images with different angles and different scaling to carry out the experiments. The experimental results show that this algorithm is a good method for object detection and localization. © 2016 IEEE.",,20164603020365,7586603,"He, Kangjian (1); Zhou, Dongming (1); Nie, Rencan (1); Jin, Xin (1); Wang, Quan (1) ","(1) Information College, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650504, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,124212.0,"June 4, 2016 - June 6, 2016","Beijing, China","8th IEEE International Conference on Communication Software and Networks, ICCSN 2016",Object recognition - Regression analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICCSN.2016.7586603,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61365001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61463052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61365001 and Grant 61463052.,9781509017805.0,,,"October 7, 2016",English,Object detection,"Proceedings of 2016 8th IEEE International Conference on Communication Software and Networks, ICCSN 2016",13.0,647-651,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of 2016 8th IEEE International Conference on Communication Software and Networks, ICCSN 2016",,Image specific target detection and localization based on locally adaptive regression kernels algorithm,,Computer vision technology - Cosine similarity - Detection and localization - Image detection - Locality preserving projections - locally adaptive regression kernels - Object detection and localizations - Salient features,
Neurocomputing,"Dimensional sentiment analysis that aims to predict a continuous numerical value on multiple dimensions, such as the valence-arousal (VA) space, has attracted more attention in recent years. Compared to the categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary classification (positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. Therefore, recent studies have investigated the automatic development of affective lexicons with VA ratings because such resources are fundamental and useful for building dimensional sentiment applications. Due to the limited number of VA lexicons, a cross-lingual approach has emerged that aims to estimate the VA ratings of affective words of one language from those of another language based on linear regression or other regression methods. However, one of the major limitations of linear regression is the under-fitting problem which can cause a poor fit between the algorithm and the training data. To tackle this problem, this study proposes a locally weighted method to improve linear regression for predicting the valence-arousal values of affective words. This method performs a regression around the point of interest using only training data that are 'local' to that point, and thus can reduce the impact of noise from unrelated training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a lower error rate and a higher correlation coefficient for predicting the VA ratings of Chinese affective words from English VA lexicons. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20161302153749,,"Wang, Jin (1, 3, 4); Yu, Liang-Chih (2, 4); Lai, K.

Appl Therm Eng,"The heat flux distributions on the membrane walls in the furnace of a 600 MW supercritical arch-fired boiler (SC-AFB) were studied by numerical simulation and field measurements. The results revealed that on the front and rear walls, the horizontal heat flux profiles in the upper furnace exhibit an M-shaped pattern. At full boiler load, on the front wall the distance between two peaks is about half of the furnace width around the conjunction area of the upper and lower furnaces and it decreases as the furnace height increases. While on the rear wall, the two high heat flux zones on each half wall nearly merge and the distance between the two peaks is about 1/3 of the boiler width. As boiler load decreases, the heat flux is smaller and distribution becomes more uniform. At all loads, on the side walls, the profiles are only in bell-shaped. The predicted heat flux distributions are in good agreement in trend and value with the measurement data. Numerical simulation also revealed that the M-shaped heat flux distribution is a special feature of an AFB/SC-AFB whose furnace has a rectangular horizontal cross section with a large width/depth ratio.

Forests,"The segmented taper equation has great flexibility and is widely applied in exiting taper systems. The unconstrained least square regression (ULSR) was generally used to estimate parameters in previous applications of the segmented taper equations. The joint point parameters estimated with ULSR may fall outside the feasible region, which leads to the results of the segmented taper equation being uncertain and meaningless. In this study, a combined method of constrained two-dimensional optimum seeking and least square regression (CTOS & LSR) was proposed as an improved method to estimate the parameters in the segmented taper equation. The CTOS & LSR was compared with ULSR for both individual tree-level equation and the population average-level equation using data from three tropical precious tree species (Castanopsis hystrix, Erythrophleum fordii, and Tectona grandis) in the southwest of China. The differences between CTOS & LSR and ULSR were found to be significant. The segmented taper equation estimated using CTOS & LSR resulted in not only increased prediction accuracy, but also guaranteed the parameter estimates in a more meaningful way. It is thus recommended that the combined method of constrained two-dimensional optimum seeking and least square regression should be a preferred choice for this application. The computation procedures required for this method is presented in the article. © 2016 by the authors.",Open Access,20164202912272,194,"Pang, Lifeng (1); Ma, Yongpeng (2); Sharma, Ram P.

J Lightwave Technol,"A dual Schottky diode-based ultrabroadband predistortion circuit (PDC) is designed and experimentally verified to linearize both directly and externally modulated radio-over-fiber (RoF) transmission systems. A monolithic dual Schottky diode is used in the PDC to reduce the footprint and improve the bandwidth. The measured S-parameters show that the circuit is able to work for up to 40 GHz. The theory of third order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) generation by the PDC is established, and calculated IMD3 agrees well with the measured. Two measures are used to verify the PDC: Spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and error vector magnitude (EVM) for WiFi signal at 2.4 GHz. For a directly modulated RoF transmission linearized by the PDC, the SFDR is improved by ~12 dB. For an externally Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) modulated RoF transmission linearized by the PDC, the SFDR is improved by higher than 5 dB from 2 to 30 GHz, and in particular higher than 12 dB from 2 to 5 GHz. For 2.4-GHz WiFi signal over the externally modulated RoF transmission linearized by the PDC, the EVM for WiFi signal is improved by up to 5.1 dB for back-to-back and 3.5 dB for 20-km SMF transmission. © 2017 IEEE.",Open Access,20173404056304,,"Zhu, Ran (1, 2); Zhang, Xiupu (1, 2); Shen, Dongya (1, 2); Zhang, Ye (2) ","(1) ICom Laboratories, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) IPhotonics Laboratories, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal; QC; H3G1M8, Canada ",JLTEDG,703.1 Electric Networks - 713.4 Pulse Circuits - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 717.1 Optical Communication Systems,,,,,Fibers - Light modulators - Linearization - Microwave circuits - Radio transmission - Scattering parameters - Schottky barrier diodes - Timing circuits - Wireless local area networks (WLAN),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/JLT.2016.2604395,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FA027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2012HA005, Acronym: FQRNT, Sponsor: Fonds Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies; Number: 61561052, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; Number: 61561051, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by a Quebec FQRNT project in broadband photonic devices, Yunnan high-tech top-talents recruitment project 2012HA005, a key project of Yunnan natural science foundation, China, (2013FA027), and two projects from National Science Foundation of China 61561051 and 61561052.",,07338724,22.0,"November 15, 2016",English,Radio-over-fiber,,17.0,5137-5145,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Journal of Lightwave Technology,,Ultra Broadband Predistortion Circuit for Radio-over-Fiber Transmission Systems,,Fiber optic communications - Microwave Photonics - Predistortion circuits - Radio over fiber system - Radio over fibers (ROF) - Radio-over-fiber transmission - Spurious free dynamic range - Third order intermodulation distortion,34
Sensors,"Due to its adjustable electronic properties and effective excitation of surface plasmons in the infrared and terahertz frequency range, research on graphene has attracted a great deal of attention. Here, we demonstrate that plasmon modes in graphene-coated dielectric nanowire (GNW) waveguides can be excited by a monolayer graphene ribbon. What is more the transverse resonant frequency spectrum of the GNW can be flexibly tuned by adjusting the chemical potential of graphene, and amplitude of the resonance peak varies linearly with the imaginary part of the analyte permittivity. As a consequence, the GNW works as a probe for capturing the molecular spectrum. Broadband sensing of toluene, ethanol and sulfurous anhydride thin layers is demonstrated by calculating the changes in spectral intensity of the propagating mode and the results show that the intensity spectra correspond exactly to the infrared spectra of these molecules. This may open an effective avenue to design sensors for detecting nanometric-size molecules in the terahertz and infrared regimes. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Open Access,20162202449937,773,"Cheng, Yue (1); Yang, Jingjing (1); Lu, Qiannan (1); Tang, Hao (2); Huang, Ming (1) ","(1) Wireless Innovation Lab of Yunnan University, School of Information Science and Engineering, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Radio Monitoring Center of Yunnan Province, Kunming; Yunnan; 650228, China ",,711.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Relation to Various Structures - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Absorption spectra - Chemical analysis - Chemical potential - Electronic properties - Mass spectrometry - Molecular spectroscopy - Molecules - Natural frequencies - Sensors - Sulfur dioxide - Surface plasmons,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Ming(huangming@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.3390/s16060773,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 20125301120009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20135301110003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013M531989, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2014T70890, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2015FA015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013FA006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61461052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61261002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11564044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61161007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61161007, 61261002, 61461052, 11564044), the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (Grant No. 20135301110003, 20125301120009), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2013M531989, 2014T70890), and the Key Program of Natural Science of Yunnan Province (Grant Nos. 2013FA006, 2015FA015).",,14248220,6.0,June 2016,English,Graphene,,40.0,,,2016,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Sensors (Switzerland),,Molecular spectrum capture by tuning the chemical potential of graphene,,Dielectric nanowires - Graphene ribbons - Infrared spectrum - Molecular spectra - Propagating mode - Spectral intensity - Sulfurous anhydride - Terahertz frequency range,16
Ceram Int,"Reduced graphene oxide/cryptomelane (RGO/KMn8O16) composites are successfully synthesized from α-MnO2nanorods and GO using a water-bathing precipitation method. The unique structure of KMn8O16nanorods, with a length of 2-4 μm, dispersed on the surface of RGO leads to a much enhanced electrical conductivity and ionic transport, finally achieving composites with an improved electrochemical performance. Electrochemical measurement results show a specific capacitance of 222.3 F/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g, much higher than that of the original α-MnO2. After 500 cycles at 2.0 A/g, the RGO/KMn8O16composite electrode still retains 92.6% of its initial specific capacitance.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Comput. Commun., ICCC - Proc.","The continuously growing volume of massive remote sensing data raised huge challenges on storage space and querying efficiency. In this paper, a new management model of remote sensing data has been proposed to address these issues of system architecture, data storage strategies, and functionalities based on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The model is capable of relieving the overloading problems of the single NameNode server in HDFS by taking a dual storage mechanism and a simulating operations method. On one hand, Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and HDFS are separately taken to store and manage image files and related metadata of remote sensing data; on the other hand, operations of file systems are simulated by RDBMS.

Appl. Opt.,"We design and fabricate an asymmetric liquidcore cylindrical lens (ALCL), which is used to measure the binary liquid diffusion coefficient (D). Acting as both diffusion cell and key imaging element, ALCL is of the function to measure the refractive index (RI) of liquid filled in its core in the way of spatial resolution. Comparing the ALCL with a symmetric liquidcore cylindrical lens (SLCL), the spherical aberration is reduced from about 300 μm (SLCL) to less than 5 μm (ALCL) when the RI of filled liquid is near 1.333, while the measurement accuracy of the RI of the ALCL is superior to 0.0002, which is much better than that of the SLCL. Equipped with the ALCL, the D value of triethylene glycol diffusing in water is measured at 25°C. The result is D =0.7515 × 105cm2s, a value very close to the literature value. The rational design of ALCL gives the optical method for measuring the D value good measurement precision and direct observation of the diffusive process as well as a simple experimental instrument. © 2016 Optical Society of America.",,20161402205249,,"Sun, Licun (1); Du, Chao (1); Li, Qiang (1, 2); Pu, Xiaoyun (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) SolidState Lighting Engineering Research Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi; 710049, China ",APOPAI,741.1 Light/Optics,,,,,Diffusion in liquids - Liquids - Refractive index,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pu, Xiaoyun(xypu@163.com) ",10.1364/AO.55.002011,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),21553165,"Number: 11164033, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61465014, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Funding.

Neurocomputing,"In recent years, semi-supervised learning has played a key part in large-scale image management, where usually only a few images are labeled. To address this problem, many representative works have been reported, including transductive SVM, universum SVM, co-training and graph-based methods. The prominent method is the patch alignment framework, which unifies the traditional spectral analysis methods. In this paper, we propose Hessian regression based on the patch alignment framework. In particular, we construct a Hessian using the patch alignment framework and apply it to regression problems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on Hessian construction from the patch alignment viewpoint. Compared with the traditional Laplacian regularization, Hessian can better match the data and then leverage the performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct human face recognition experiments on a celebrity face dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution in human face classification. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20161702309445,,"Liu, Weifeng (1); Liu, Hongli (1); Tao, Dapeng (2) ","(1) College of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao; 266580, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",NRCGEO,,,,,,Graphic methods - Spectrum analysis - Supervised learning,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tao, Dapeng(dapeng.tao@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.neucom.2015.07.152,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18728286,"Number: JCYJ20140901003939001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: YCX201549, Acronym: CUPB, Sponsor: China University of Petroleum, Beijing; Number: 14CX02203A, Acronym: CUPB, Sponsor: China University of Petroleum, Beijing; Number: 2014A030310252, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 61271407, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61301242, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 61301242 , 61271407 ), the Guangdong Natural Science Funds (Grant no. 2014A030310252 ), the Shenzhen Technology Project (Grant no.

Chem. Phys. Lett.,"A systematic study of the geometric structures of steady states and metastable states of silicon oxide clusters has been performed using density functional theory. We find that silicon-rich and oxygen-rich clusters have different characteristics. Oxygen-rich clusters usually have oxygen atoms on the edges of the clusters, but separated from others by Si atoms. However, silicon-rich clusters tend to have rings nested within each other. The spectra for the structures have been calculated to compare with observed spectra. The predicted structures and spectroscopic properties are expected to be useful for the identification of silicon oxide species in the interstellar medium. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J. Eng. Sci. Technol. Rev.,"As a mining method that can achieve highly efficient continuous stoping, the two-step stoping method exploits ore body from pillars to rooms after cemented filling of pillars, thereby making alternate continuous stoping between pillars and rooms after tailing backfilling of rooms. The key of this method is to ensure the stability of cemented filling pillar. The instantaneous effect of dynamic load, which is produced by blasting an adjacent room, is the strongest destructive power to cemented filling pillar. In this study, three room blasting schemes based on the original blasting parameters were proposed to reduce vibration damages to adjacent cemented filling pillar. The propagation of stress waves in rock mass and cemented filling pillar during millisecond-delay blasting was simulated by the ANSYS/LS-DYNA program. Finally, the blasting parameters, including charging pattern, hole spacing, and burden, were optimized based on the simulation results. The optimized blasting scheme was applied for practical room blasting. Results showed that, after the optimized blasting scheme was used, the peak particle velocity (PPV) at cemented filling pillar decreased by 52% and the cemented filling pillar remained stable with slight damage. Meanwhile, rock fragments after room blasting were even in size and the substantial rock production was only 6%, thereby achieving the ideal blasting effect. Optimized blasting parameters could provide references for room blasting design and operation under two-step stoping. © 2016 Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology.",,20171803634421,,"Zeng, Q.T.

Conf., APPEEC","In this paper, some models of typical potential transformers (PT) were established by PSCAD/EMTDC considering the non-linear magnetic excitation characteristic. A test system for the experimental research in a 10kV neutral non-grounding distribution power grid was also set up. A series of simulating tests to reproduce ferroresonance initiated by single phase grounding or line breaking fault were carried out. The frequency analysis based on FFT method has been applied on the feature extraction of the voltage and PT current waveforms. The basic characteristics of ferroresonance with frequency, such as the ratio of capacitive reactance and inductive reactance (XC/XL), the magnitude and waveforms of the overvoltage and PT current, have been studied and summarized. The results of experimental verification indicate that the simulation models are finely closed to the characteristic of real power grid operation. The PT current can reach 5 to 10 p.u. when subharmonic ferroresonance occurs. The deep magnetic saturation of PT will bring the high components of current harmonics. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170403277835,7779957,"Tian, Shijin (1); Tianlong, Zhang (1); Liu, Xuezhong (1); Liu, Hongwen (2); Li, Ruigui (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China (2) Yunnan Electric Power Research Institute, Kunming, China (3) Siehui Electric Corporation, Shijiazhuang, China ",,701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 708.1 Dielectric Materials,125362.0,"October 25, 2016 - October 28, 2016","19-1#, Jiangong Road, Xi'an, China","2016 IEEE PES Asia Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC 2016",Dielectric materials - Magnetic resonance,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779957,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),21574847,,,9781509054183.0,21574839,,"December 9, 2016",English,Electric power transmission networks,IEEE PES APPEEC 2016 - 2016 IEEE PES Asia Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference,9.0,2588-2591,1of1,2016,IEEE Computer Society,"Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC",Beijing Sifang Automation Co.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Context. Wide binaries are a potential pathway for the formation of hot Jupiters. The binary fraction among host stars is an important discriminator between competing formation theories, but has not been well characterised. Additionally, contaminating light from unresolved stars can significantly affect the accuracy of photometric and spectroscopic measurements in studies of transiting exoplanets. Aims. We observed 101 transiting exoplanet host systems in the Southern hemisphere in order to create a homogeneous catalogue of both bound companion stars and contaminating background stars, in an area of the sky where transiting exoplanetary systems have not been systematically searched for stellar companions. We investigate the binary fraction among the host stars in order to test theories for the formation of hot Jupiters. Methods. Lucky imaging observations from the Two Colour Instrument on the Danish 1.54 m telescope at La Silla were used to search for previously unresolved stars at small angular separations. The separations and relative magnitudes of all detected stars were measured. For 12 candidate companions to 10 host stars, previous astrometric measurements were used to evaluate how likely the companions are to be physically associated. Results. We provide measurements of 499 candidate companions within 20 arcsec of our sample of 101 planet host stars. 51 candidates are located within 5 arcsec of a host star, and we provide the first published measurements for 27 of these. Calibrations for the plate scale and colour performance of the Two Colour Instrument are presented. Conclusions. We find that the overall multiplicity rate of the host stars is 38-13+17%, consistent with the rate among solar-type stars in our sensitivity range, suggesting that planet formation does not preferentially occur in long period binaries compared to a random sample of field stars. Long period stellar companions (P > 10 yr) appear to occur independently of short period companions, and so the population of close-in stellar companions is unconstrained by our study. © ESO, 2016.",Open Access,20161802337819,A58,"Evans, D.F.

Annu. Rep. Conf. Electr. Insul. Dielectr. Phenom. CEIDP,"Copper corrosion in transformers is one of the serious problems affecting the life of the transformers. Much work has been done to improve corrosion resistant of copper. Grain boundary engineering (GBE) is an effective method to enhance the property of corrosion resistant by optimization of deformation and heat treatment processes to change the number and distribution of the special grain boundary, thus improving material certain macro performance associated with grain boundaries. In this study, pure copper first cold rolled 35%, then annealed at varied temperature. Then, the evolution of grain sizes and special grain boundaries after the processing and annealing have been particularly analyzed by electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD). Meanwhile, according to IEC62535 standard, the copper samples with two layers insulating paper were immersed in corrosive oil for 72 hours at 150°C. The corrosion of copper samples was investigated. It shows that annealing temperature affects seriously the number of special grain boundary and the grain size of copper sequentially enhancing the corrosion resistant of copper in insulating oil contained corrosion sulfur. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170303264522,7785588,"Yuan, Yuan (1); Jiang, Zhou (1); Xiao, He (2); Lijun, Yang (3) ","(1) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China (2) Yunnan Power Grid Co., Ltd., Electric Power Research Institute, Kunming; 650217, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China ",CEIPAZ,413 Insulating Materials - 535.1.2 Rolling Mill Practice - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 539.1 Metals Corrosion - 544.1 Copper - 704.2 Electric Equipment - 804 Chemical Products Generally,125477.0,"October 16, 2016 - October 19, 2016","Toronto, ON, Canada","2016 IEEE Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, CEIDP 2016",Annealing - Cold rolling - Copper - Corrosion resistance - Corrosive effects - Grain boundaries - Grain size and shape - Insulation - Metal cladding - Oil filled transformers - Sulfur,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yuan, Yuan ",10.1109/CEIDP.2016.7785588,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 51677015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51407018, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51277187, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to thank the support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (51407018), (51677015) and (51277187).",9781509046546.0,00849162,,"December 15, 2016",English,Copper corrosion,"2016 IEEE Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, CEIDP 2016",17.0,911-914,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Annual Report - Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, CEIDP",,The effect of annealing temperature on the corrosion behavior of copper in insulating oil contained corrosion sulfur,,Annealing temperatures - Corrosion behavior - Corrosion-resistant - Effect of annealing - Electron back scatter diffraction - Evolution of grain - Grain boundary engineering - Heat treatment process,2016-December
ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,"There has been strong and growing interest in the development of cost-effective and highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for alternative fuels utilization and conversion devices. We report herein that semimetallic Cu3P nanoarrays directly grown on 3D copper foam (CF) substrate can function as effective electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Specifically, the surface oxidation-activated Cu3P only required a relatively low overpotential of 412 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2and displayed a small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec-1in 0.1 M KOH solution, on account of the collaborative effect of large roughness factor (RF) and semimetallic character. Following that, investigations into the mechanism revealed the formation of a unique active phase during the water oxidation process in which conductive Cu3P was the core covered with a thin copper oxide/hydroxide layer. Moreover, this Cu3P 3D electrode was also applied to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and showed good catalytic performance and stability under the same basic conditions. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,20163702808707,,"Hou, Chun-Chao (1); Chen, Qian-Qian (1); Wang, Chuan-Jun (1); Liang, Fei (2); Lin, Zheshuai (2); Fu, Wen-Fu (1, 3); Chen, Yong (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Photochemical Conversion and Optoelectronic Materials, HKU-CAS Joint Laboratory on New Materials, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100190, China (2) Key Laboratory of Functional Crystals and Laser Technology, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100190, China (3) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 911.2 Industrial Economics,,,,,Copper oxides - Cost effectiveness - Electrocatalysis - Electrocatalysts - Electrodes - Hydrogen - Ionization of gases - Oxidation - Oxygen - Potassium hydroxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Yong(chenyong@mail.ipc.ac.cn) ",10.1021/acsami.6b06251,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19448252,"Number: XDB17030200, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2013CB632403, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013CB834800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21371175, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",We appreciate the financial support from the National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2013CB834800 and 2013CB632403) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB17030200).

Trans Can Soc Mech Eng,"This paper proposes a coupling dynamic model for multi-stage planetary gears train (PGT) based on the gearing theory and Lagrange equation, which is developed by analyzing the displacement relationships of gearing system and the influence of floating components. The time-varying mesh stiffness, bearings in housing, and the torsional support stiffness of ring gears are also considered. This model has 26 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) and adopts three planar DOFs for each central component, mesh phasing relations among planetary gears, and the rotational DOF for the planets of each stage. The modified transverse-torsional model is established in the rotating Cartesian coordinates by using the lumped-parameter method; thus this model is more accurate than the purely torsional model for describing the physical dynamics. The acceleration data is tested by using the scheme of a back-to-back power circulation set-up, and the vibration properties are also studied. © 2016, Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering.

"ICALIP - Int. Conf. Audio, Lang. Image Process. - Proc.","Image registration techniques in remote sensing (RS) images play an important role in the field of geographic information system. However, the registration accuracies using current techniques are significantly affected when ground relief variations and imaging viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose an image registration method for RS images with different viewpoints. We represent two RS images taken from different viewpoints (or affected by ground relief variations) using their extracted SIFT feature points, and register them by the proposed mixed feature based non-rigid correspondence estimator for solving the problems of ground relief variations and imaging viewpoint changes. The image transformation model for finally mapping two images is defined by an affine transformation.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Real-Time Comput. Robot., RCAR","For the design of virtual desktop, more natural, intuitive, and actual interaction styles have become the main design principle. In this paper, we present a virtual 3D desktop which integrates physics and bimanual input commands based on pen + touch. Objects on the desktop own physical properties, such as mass, dimensions, gravity etc. And they can be dragged casually and collide other objects under the effect of physical properties, just like we manipulate objects in the real word. We have designed a series of interaction techniques based on pen + touch input to support the desktop organization by observing people's operation behaviors in the real word. This novel interaction techniques making up the defects of input separately combines the advantages of touch input and pen input. A user survey experiment was designed to test the validity of the virtual desktop model. The result shows that the 3D desktop give the intuitive and actual feelings to users, and the interaction techniques we proposed is more efficient and natural. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170403280268,7784013,"Yin, Jibin (1); Gao, Yang (1) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,"722.2 Computer Peripheral Equipment - 731.5 Robotics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 931.5 Gravitation, Relativity and String Theory",125434.0,"June 6, 2016 - June 9, 2016","No. 555, Phum Kruos, Sangkat Svay Dangkum, Siem Reap, Cambodia","2016 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2016",Gravitation - Human computer interaction - Physical properties - Robotics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/RCAR.2016.7784013,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61262042, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61262042).,9781467389594.0,,,"December 14, 2016",English,User interfaces,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2016",8.0,129-133,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2016",et al.; Harbin Institute of Technology; IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS); Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); National University of Defense Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,The design and research of 3D desktop interface based on the Pen + Touch,,3D desktop - Design Principles - Interaction styles - Interaction techniques - Multi-touch interfaces - Novel interaction techniques - Pen-based interfaces - Virtual desktops,

Polym. Chem.,"We report a class of poly(anionic liquid) microgels that undergo stimuli-responsive volume phase transitions. Such a microgel is synthesized by free radical precipitation polymerization of a tetrabutylphosphonium 4-styrenesulfonate monomer and a cross-linker N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide. These microgels can not only undergo reversible volume phase transitions in response to changes in temperature in water, methanol, or water/methanol mixtures, but also undergo re-entrant swelling-shrinking-swelling transitions as the methanol content increases in water/methanol mixtures at a set temperature in our experimental temperature window of 25.0-64.0 °C. Such microgels can be post functionalized, e.g., via ion-exchange treatment with HSO3CF3to partially transform sulfonate to the catalytic Brønsted acidic -SO3H, whilst the yielded microgels can inherit the responsive properties. With both responsive and catalytic properties simultaneously harnessed on the same object, the functionalized microgels potentially can be used as a highly efficient catalyst for the esterification reaction of palmitic acid and the transesterification reaction of tripalmitin with methanol (as model reactions) at 65.0 °C (temperature of an oil bath), and allow the catalytic activity to be modulated to a certain extent in a non-monotonous way, making it possible to boost the reactions at a relatively lower temperature (e.g., 42.0 °C), while maintaining considerable catalytic activity. These features underlie the feasible use of the microgels in biodiesel production (with waste cooking oil as a model feedstock). © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20163602769238,,"Chen, Shoumin (1); Peng, Yahui (1); Wu, Qingshi (1); Chang, Aiping (1); Qu, Anqi (1); Shen, Jing (2); Xie, Jianda (3); Farooqi, Zahoor H.

BioResour.,"Black liquor (BL) can be regarded as the energy and alkali resource of the pulping mill. In this work, the effects of the characteristics of black liquor derived from the alkali-oxygen pulping of rice straw were studied. Through analyses of the chemical and physical properties, especially the thermodynamics properties, which depend on suspended matter and alkalinity, it was shown that the removal of the suspended matter from the black liquor could effectively improve its thermodynamic properties, particularly in making its solids content reach up to more than 56% at the turning point of its viscosity. Moreover, sodium salt played an important role in the presence of macromolecules and silica in the BL. When the BL was adjusted to pH = 11 with NaOH, the filtered BL had the lowest silica content, the highest volumetric isothermal expansivity (VIE), was more susceptibility to thermal cracking, and was more suitable for processing for alkali recovery.",Open Access,20161902372429,,"Zhang, Lilong (1); Chen, Keli (1) ","(1) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650500, China ",,"641.1 Thermodynamics - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,,Chemical analysis - Cracking (chemical) - Oxygen - pH - Silica - Sodium hydroxide - Thermodynamics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Keli(chenkeli_prof@sina.com) ",10.15376/biores.11.2.4252-4267,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19302126,"Number: 21276119, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21276119).,,,2.0,"May 1, 2016",English,Alkalinity,,35.0,4252-4267,,2016,North Carolina State University,BioResources,,Effects of pH and suspended matter on the physico-chemical properties of black liquor from alkali-oxygen pulping of rice straw,,Alkali-oxygen pulping - Black liquor - Rice straws - Suspended matters - Thermodynamics property,11

RSC Adv.,"The crystalline phases and bioactivity of materials play crucial factors in determining the biological interactions and osseointegration process of orthopaedic replacements or implants. In this study, (Ti-13Nb-13Zr)-10hydroxyapatite (HA) composites were fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) process at different sintering temperatures (950-1150 °C) with the synergistic effects of Ti-13Nb-13Zr and HA. The effects of the sintering temperature on the microstructure evolution, mechanical properties, corrosion behaviour and in vitro bioactivity in simulated body fluid of the composites were investigated. The results show that the composites consist of (α + β)-Ti and HA matrix, and reaction products of metal-ceramic phases (CaO, TCP, CaZrO3, Ti3P5etc.). With the sintering temperature increasing, the α-Ti phase gradually decreases, while the β-Ti phase and metal-ceramic phases gradually increase. The relative density, elastic modulus, compressive strength and yield strength of the composites increase with increasing sintering temperature. However, when the sintering temperature exceeds 1050 °C, metal-ceramic phases rapidly increase due to the violent reaction between Ti metal and HA ceramic, which leads to the elastic modulus increasing intensely. At the same time, the surface of the composites after soaking in SBF spontaneously nucleated and precipitated diverse bone-like apatite layers, indicating that the composites exhibit high bioactivity and that the surface activity is enhanced by the sintering temperature. The results demonstrate that (Ti-13Nb-13Zr)-10HA composites sintered between 1000 and 1050 °C are potential biomaterials for orthopedic replacement or implants. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,20164502981233,,"He, Y.H.

Phys B Condens Matter,"Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) thin films were grown on Mo-coated Soda-lime-glass (SLG) substrates by sulfurization of sputtered ZnS/Sn/CuS precursors at different temperatures i.e. 560 °C, 580 °C and 600 °C. The effects of sulfurization temperature on the quality of CZTS thin films and solar cells were investigated. The crystal structure, surface morphology, chemical composition, phase purity and surface roughness of CZTS thin films fabricated at different sulfurization temperatures were characterized by X Ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscope (AFM), respectively. The results show that all CZTS thin films exhibit a polycrystalline kesterite structure and preferred (112) orientation. For the sulfurization temperature of 580 °C, the obtained CZTS thin films are dense and flat with larger grain size.

RSC Adv.,"The present work elucidated the effects of structures and surface species on the activity of CeO2and SO42-doped MCM-41 catalysts toward NO reduction by NH3. The results indicated that the sulfated species were generated over Cat-A (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and H2SO4simultaneously doped on MCM-41) and Cat-B (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O first immersed to MCM-41 and followed by impregnation of H2SO4) except for Cat-C (H2SO4first doped onto MCM-41 and followed by Ce(NO3)3·6H2O). The sulfate ion contributed to the formation of Ce3+concentration, oxygen vacancies, and surface acidity, resulting in improvement of SCR activity. However, the positive influence on SCR activity was overwhelmed by the decomposition of sulfated species. The apparent activation energy of Cat-A (60 kJ mol-1) was much lower compared with that of Cat-B and Cat-C (71 and 78 kJ mol-1, respectively). Pore structures and surface species were responsible for the SCR activity over the CeO2and SO42-doped MCM-41 catalysts.

Ceram Int,"Pure and Al-doped macro-/nanoporous ZnO were synthesized via solution combustion method by using zincacetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)26H2O), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) and glycine (C2H5NO2) as precursors. The morphology, structure and catalytic properties of the as-synthesized macro-/nanoporous products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–Vis spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption-desorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Pure and Al-doped ZnO have coral-like shape with the pores size ranging from several nanometers to ten micrometers. The walls of the macropores contain smaller nanopores, exhibiting the hierarchically porous morphology. The catalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples were tested by measuring the degradation efficiency of azo dye Congo red (CR) under visible light, UV light and dark light, respectively.

Comput. Electron. Agric.,"New technologies, such as three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning and stereo imaging, have recently been adopted for quantifying plant structure. The datasets collected using such technologies offer realistic representations of the morphological characteristics of the studied plant organs. The datasets, however, are very large and occupy excessive amount of storage space. Moreover, the computation time is also very long when these datasets are made the subject of further analysis and simulation. Some dataset simplification is essential if the balance between storage cost and computation time vs the accuracy of the plant geometry description is to be optimised. In this study, the surface morphologies of field-grown maize and tobacco leaves were measured using 3D laser scanning and were progressively simplified using two different methods - Vertex removal and Edge collapse. To evaluate the impacts of simplification on the accuracy of the leaf-surface morphological descriptions, several error metrics were developed. These metrics are able to quantify these impacts in various respects. The statistical results show that most error metrics increase only marginally, even with moderate simplifications of the leaf surfaces. The errors, however, increase quickly with over-simplification. The simulation results of light distribution in canopies indicate that over-simplification of the leaf-surface meshes results in significant deviations in the simulated leaf light-capture efficiency compared with the original leaf surfaces. Compared with the Vertex removal method, the Edge collapse method is better at retaining the original leaf-surface morphology, but loses more of the leaf-edge information. This study provides valuable information in the analysis of high-precision plant-structure data, relevant in a range of research fields including functional-structural plant modelling and high-throughput phenotyping. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20160401840201,,"Hou, Tongyu (1); Zheng, Bangyou (2); Xu, Zhaoli (3); Yang, Yuhong (3); Chen, Yan (1); Guo, Yan (1) ","(1) College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing; 100193, China (2) CSIRO Agriculture, Queensland Bioscience Precinct, 306 Carmody Road, St. Lucia; QLD; 4067, Australia (3) Yunnan Academy of Tobacco Agricultural Sciences, Kunming; 650021, China ",CEAGE6,"722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 744.9 Laser Applications - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Digital storage - Errors - Laser applications - Morphology - Stereo image processing - Surface analysis - Surface morphology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Guo, Yan(yan.guo@cau.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.compag.2016.01.010,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 41471235, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: IRT0412, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014YL01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial Corp; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41471235 ), China tobacco Yunnan industrial Co., Ltd.

Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao,"Contact angle change is going to affect the properties of water-vapour interface in unsaturated soil. In order to study the change of contact angle in suction measurement with tensiometers and axis-translation technique, and the effects of this change on the measurement, based on the principles of surface chemistry, drying process is divided into two parts, one is external forces pattern, another is evaporation pattern. Wetting process is also divided into two parts, external forces pattern and condensation pattern. According to this, in drying process, contact angle characteristics of suction measurement with tensiometer and axis-translation were analyzed. It can be concluded that, in drying process, matric suction measured by axis-translation is higher than tensiometers with the same water content. In wetting process, matric suction measured by axis-translation is smaller than tensiometers with the same water content. The conclusion is proved by contact angle measurement tests and matric suction tests. Different type of suction measurement method should be matched with different situations. The axis-translation should be used in some unsaturated soil problems such as rain infiltration, groundwater level decline. The tensiometers could be applied to drying shrinkage in unsaturated soil. © 2016, Science Press.

"Asia-Pacific Pow. Energy Eng. Conf., APPEEC","This paper focuses on the effectiveness of anti-ferroresonance measures in distribution power grid. In order to simulate the reliability of commonly used anti-ferroresonance measures, a 10kV ferroresonance testing system was set up, and a series of experiments reproducing the ferroresonance initiated by single phase grounding fault or disconnection fault (usually accompanied by grounding) and so on were carried out. Correspondingly, several PSCAD simulation cases were established on the basis of PT models with non-linear magnetic excitation characteristic. These simulation researches discover the anti-ferroresonance performances of the primary resonance eliminator and arc suppression coil with different power system parameters, initiation mode and conditions. The simulation and verification testing are combined to evaluate the anti-ferroresonance ability of certain distribution power grid, and provide guidelines for effective protection from ferroresonance. The effectiveness of compound anti-ferroresonance strategy, which may enhance the abilitiy in suppressing the ferroresonance of the power system, is also discussed. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170403277833,7779955.0,"Zhang, Tianlong (1); Tian, Shijin (1); Liu, Xuezhong (1); Liu, Hongwen (2); Li, Ruigui (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China (2) Yunnan Electric Power Research Institute, Kunming, China (3) Siehui Electric Corporation, Shijiazhuang, China ",,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 703.1 Electric Networks - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 912.4 Personnel,125362.0,"October 25, 2016 - October 28, 2016","19-1#, Jiangong Road, Xi'an, China","2016 IEEE PES Asia Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC 2016",Ability testing - Circuit resonance - Electric arcs - Magnetic resonance,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779955,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),21574847,,,9781509054183.0,21574839,,"December 9, 2016",English,Electric power transmission networks,IEEE PES APPEEC 2016 - 2016 IEEE PES Asia Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference,5.0,2584-2587,1of1,2016,IEEE Computer Society,"Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC",Beijing Sifang Automation Co.

Int J Appl Electromagnet Mech,"This paper presents a wholly analytical method which combines electromagnetic and ultrasonic simulations for the study of an Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer Array (EMAT). Analytical solutions to the eddy current problem for the meander coil used in an EMAT are adapted from the classic Deeds and Dodd solution, which was originally intended for circular coils. The analytical solution resulting from this novel adaptation exploits the large radius extrapolation and shows several advantages over the finite element method (FEM), especially in the higher frequency regime. The calculated Lorentz force density from the EM solver is then coupled to the ultrasonic simulations, which exploit an analytical solution for generating the distribution of surface waves. Beam features are studied, which can produce performance parameters for an EMAT array, facilitating the optimum design of such sensors. This total analytical approach to an EMAT simulation has not been reported previously to our knowledge. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.",,20163502744862,,"Xie, Yuedong (1); Yin, Liyuan (2); Sergio, Rodriguez G.

Hydrometallurgy,"The synergistic effect of a mixture of bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfoxide (BESO) and primary amine N1923 in kerosene on the extraction of Au(I) from alkaline cyanide solution was investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that addition of BESO into the organic phase can significantly enhance the basicity of amine N1923, in which the pH50value can reach up to 11.91. Slope analysis suggested that the composition of the extracted complexes in the organic phase is [Au(CN)2-·RNH3+·2BESO]. The extracted complexes were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy,1H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and electrical conductivity analysis. FTIR and1H NMR studies reveal strong interactions between BESO and N1923 molecules through hydrogen bonding between the O atoms in the S=O groups and the H atoms in the -NH2groups, forming S=O...H-N. This hydrogen bonding enhances the basicity of N1923 and consequently the ability of N1923 to capture proton; Au(CN)2-serves as a counter anion against the protonated amine cation in the organic phase. Electrical conductivity measurements confirmed ionic character of the extracted complexes. The Au(I) extraction in the N1923/BESO system most probably involves the ion-association (ion pair) mechanism. A plausible microstructural model of the extracted complexes was proposed in the paper. Moreover, gold could be efficiently stripped from the loaded organic phase by using sodium hydroxide solution. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon,"This study investigated the regeneration of phenol-saturated activated carbon fiber (ACF) by an electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process. Results show that approximately ∼30% of the sorbed phenol was irreversibly adsorbed on ACF, and could not be effectively desorbed by conventional cathodic regeneration. Therefore, the cathodic regeneration restored only about 68% of the adsorption capacity of ACF for phenol reloading. In comparison, by combining the cathodic regeneration with ozonation, the E-peroxone regeneration process could oxidatively convert irreversibly sorbed phenol to more desorbable transformation products, and thus enhanced the regeneration efficiency up to ∼90%. Due to the irreversible adsorption of phenol and oxidation of ACF by oxidants such as O3and [rad]OH, the adsorption capacity of ACF declined during multiple cycles of phenol adsorption and E-peroxone regeneration, especially when high ozone dose was used in the regeneration. By optimizing the ozone dose, the modifications of ACF properties due to O3and [rad]OH oxidation could be minimized. Consequently, after twelve cycles of the E-peroxone regeneration, the ACF retained still ∼72% of the adsorption capacity of the virgin control. These results suggest that the E-peroxone process may provide a more effective alternative to conventional cathodic regeneration for the regeneration of ACs saturated with irreversibly sorbed organics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20164202926213,,"Zhan, Juhong (1, 2); Wang, Yujue (1); Wang, Huijiao (1); Shen, Wenhua (1); Pan, Xuejun (2); Wang, Jinlin (3); Yu, Gang (1) ","(1) School of Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory for Emerging Organic Contaminants Control, State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Tsinghua University, Beijing; 100084, China (2) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (3) City College of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",CRBNAH,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Activated carbon - Adsorption - Carbon fibers - Ozone - Ozonization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yujue(wangyujue@tsinghua.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.carbon.2016.08.034,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 20141081174, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: IRT1261, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; ","This research is supported by Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program ( 20141081174 ), the special fund of State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control ( 16Y03ESPCT ), and Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University ( IRT1261 ).

Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"A combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with chemometrics tools provided an approach for studying Marsdenia tenacissima according to its geographical origin. A total of 128 M. tenacissima samples from four provinces in China were analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy. Six pattern recognition methods were used to construct the discrimination models: support vector machine-genetic algorithms, support vector machine-particle swarm optimization, K-nearest neighbors, radial basis function neural network, random forest and support vector machine-grid search. Experimental results showed that K-nearest neighbors was superior to other mathematical algorithms after data were preprocessed with wavelet de-noising, with a discrimination rate of 100% in both the training and prediction sets. This study demonstrated that FTIR spectroscopy coupled with K-nearest neighbors could be successfully applied to determine the geographical origins of M. tenacissima samples, thereby providing reliable authentication in a rapid, cheap and noninvasive way. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,20153101100510,,"Li, Chao (1); Yang, Sheng-Chao (2); Guo, Qiao-Sheng (1); Zheng, Kai-Yan (1); Wang, Ping-Li (3); Meng, Zhen-Gui (2) ","(1) Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing; 210095, China (2) Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 605201, China (3) Yunnan Xintong Botanic Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Mengzi; 661100, China ",SAMCAS,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 801 Chemistry - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 961 Systems Science",,,,,Decision trees - Genetic algorithms - Motion compensation - Nearest neighbor search - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) - Pattern recognition - Radial basis function networks - Support vector machines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Sheng-Chao(shengchaoyang@163.com) ",10.1016/j.saa.2015.07.086,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,"This research work was financially supported by Yunnan Xintong Botanic Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd .

J. Commun.,"MAC (medium access control) protocol plays an important role in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) due to limited bandwidth and battery. MAC protocol that provides Priority-based quality of service (QoS) which satisfies various traffic transmission requirement will form the base of highperformance network application. This paper presents a new priority-based parallel schedule polling MAC protocol (PPSPMAC) in WSNs, which combines polling orders with access policies including Gated and Exhaustive access policies to realize the priority-based scheme and reduces the overhead time through parallel schedule. Then the PPSP-MAC model is set up by method of imbedded Markov chain theory and generation function and the key system performance characteristics such as mean queue length, cycle time and throughput are explicitly analyzed. Theoretical and simulation results are identical and show that the new protocol achieves a better performance than the existing protocols such as IEEE802.11, IEEE802.15.4, SMAC, PQ-MAC, etc. © 2016 Journal of Communications.",,20163602776690,,"Yang, Zhijun (1, 2); Zhu, Longzheng (1); Ding, Hongwei (1); Guan, Zheng (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) The Academy for Educational Science Research, Educational Department of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650223, China ",,"716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,Internet protocols - Markov processes - Medium access control - Quality of service,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Zhijun(yzj@ynjy.cn) ",10.12720/jcm.11.8.792-797,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,17962021,8.0,August 2016,English,Wireless sensor networks,,15.0,792-797,,2016,Engineering and Technology Publishing,Journal of Communications,,A priority-based parallel schedule polling MAC for wireless sensor networks,,Access policies - High performance networks - Mac (medium access control) protocol - Parallel scheduling - Performance characteristics - Polling - Traffic transmission - Wireless sensor network (WSNs),11
"Proc. Int. Conf. Comput. Sci. Netw. Technol., ICCSNT","The current software testing in the aspects of industrial benefits gradually causes the attention of the domestic financial bank. The innovation of software technology, the increase of software scale and the shortened developing period make the traditional manual testing meeting enormous challenges, while the development of automated testing technology has promoted the progress of the software testing industry. Because of the particularity of financial and banking services, the bank is under an obligation to ensure the quality and reliability of software. Therefore it's vital to test the software. In specific practice, although the powerful third-party testing tools can be used as a solution, it is hard to rely on certain tool to implement automated testing, hence a framework of automated test is required to be introduced for testing, which intends to handle high efficiency and high-quality testing for software automation. This paper proposes a kind of software automation testing framework based on QTP, mainly targeting on the core of the bank, credit, online banking to test the function of the three major operations. The framework is a secondary development based on QTP and mainly for regression testing of software, which integrates techniques including object recognition, data-driven, and keyword-driven technology, checkpoint technology, to proceed business-level testing. The paper expatiated on four issues, which were the test system design, the test standardization, the testing framework design and the testing of the implementation. The practical application shows that the framework can improve the operational efficiency, reduce the test cost, and guarantee the smooth progress of the software automation testing. © 2016 IEEE.",,20180104610715,8070136.0,"Xie, Xianjie (1); Yang, Zhijun (2, 3); Yu, Jiankun (1); Zhang, Weifeng (3) ","(1) School of Information, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (2) Academy for Educational Science Research, Educational Department of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650223, China (3) School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.5 Computer Applications - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 913.1 Production Engineering",131363.0,"December 10, 2016 - December 11, 2016","Changchun, China","5th International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, ICCSNT 2016",Application programs - Automation - Computer networks - Efficiency - Finance - Object recognition - Software reliability - Testing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Jiankun(yjk1102@163.com) ",10.1109/ICCSNT.2016.8070136,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61461054, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61461054.,9781509021284.0,,,"October 16, 2017",English,Software testing,"Proceedings of 2016 5th International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, ICCSNT 2016",17.0,143-147,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of 2016 5th International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, ICCSNT 2016",Changchun Normal University; Jilin University; Northeast Normal University,Design and implementation of bank financial business automation testing framework based on QTP,,Automated testing tools - Business automation - Design and implementations - Operational efficiencies - Secondary development - Software automation - Software technology - Test automation frameworks,
Mater Charact,"Microstructural features controlling cleavage fracture in pearlitic structures were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction. It was found that pearlite block size corresponds well to the cleavage facet size, and a single cleavage facet usually contains multiple pearlite colonies. Pearlite block size and cleavage facet size decrease with the refinement of prior austenite grain size, while pearlite colony size only changes slightly. The cleavage crack can largely deflect at block boundaries rather than at colony boundaries. Pearlite block can act as the dominant substructure on cleavage crack propagation in pearlitic steels. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,20163102674690,,"Zhou, Shitong (1, 2); Zuo, Yue (2, 3); Li, Zhaodong (2); Wang, Xin (1, 2); Yong, Qilong (2) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Department of Structural Steels, Central Iron and Steel Research Institute, Beijing; 100081, China (3) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",MACHEX,531.2 Metallography - 545.3 Steel - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Austenite - Brittle fracture - Cracks - Electron diffraction - Grain refinement - Microstructural evolution - Microstructure - Scanning electron microscopy - Steel,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Shitong(zhoushitong19@outlook.com) ",10.1016/j.matchar.2016.07.023,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2015AA034302, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015CB654803, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",This work is financially supported by National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2015CB654803 ) and the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (No. 2015AA034302 ).,,10445803,,"September 1, 2016",English,Pearlite,,12.0,110-113,,2016,Elsevier Inc.,Materials Characterization,,Microstructural analysis on cleavage fracture in pearlitic steels,,Block boundaries - Cleavage fracture - Electron back-scattered diffraction - Microstructural analysis - Microstructural features - Pearlitic steels - Pearlitic structure - Prior austenite grain size,119

With these two features, a multi-feature based cost matrix is then formed to provide a flexible approach to estimate correspondence by minimizing the global or local structural diversities. A GMM based energy function is finally designed for refining the transformation updating, and minimized by the L2 distance minimization.

IEEE Internet Things J.,"The ever-growing popularity of mobile devices equipped with accelerometers has provided the opportunity to capture the semantic aspects of human activity and improve user experiences with behavior-based recommendations. These functions depend heavily on the accuracy of human activity recognition, and thus real applications that use mobile devices-based human activity recognition systems (MARSs) need to seamlessly incorporate the information carried by newly labeled training samples. Motivated by the success of the weightlessness feature, we propose a new two-directional feature for bidirectional long short-Term memory (BLSTM) for incremental learning in human activity recognition. To further improve the performance, we also present a new ensemble classifier termed multicolumn BLSTM (MBLSTM), which effectively combines different acceleration signal features to further improve activity recognition accuracy. Experiments on the naturalistic mobile devices-based human activity dataset suggest that MBLSTM is superior to other state-of-The-Art MARS methods. © 2014 IEEE.",,20170403280513,7464241.0,"Tao, Dapeng (1); Wen, Yonggang (2); Hong, Richang (3) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; 639798, Singapore (3) Department of Electronic Engineering and Information System, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei; 230009, China ",,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 943.1 Mechanical Instruments - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Accelerometers - Brain - Long short-term memory - Pattern recognition - Semantics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/JIOT.2016.2561962,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),23274662,"Number: 61572486, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472116, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572486 and Grant 61472116,,,6.0,December 2016,English,Behavioral research,,51.0,1124-1134,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,Multicolumn Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory for Mobile Devices-Based Human Activity Recognition,,Acceleration signals - Activity recognition - bidirectional long short-Term memory (BLSTM) - Ensemble classifiers - Human activity recognition - Human activity recognition systems - Incremental learning - Mobile service,3

Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"A quality assessment system comprised of a tandem technique of ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy and ultra-fast liquid chromatography (UFLC) aided by multivariate analysis was presented for the determination of geographic origin of Wolfiporia extensa collected from five regions in Yunnan Province of China. Characteristic UV spectroscopic fingerprints of samples were determined based on its methanol extract. UFLC was applied for the determination of pachymic acid (a biomarker) presented in individual test samples. The spectrum data matrix and the content of pachymic acid were integrated and analyzed by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The results showed that chemical properties of samples were clearly dominated by the epidermis and inner part as well as geographical origins. The relationships among samples obtained from these five regions have been also presented. Moreover, an interesting finding implied that geographical origins had much greater influence on the chemical properties of epidermis compared with that of the inner part. This study demonstrated that a rapid tool for accurate discrimination of W. extensa by UV spectroscopy and UFLC could be available for quality control of complicated medicinal mushrooms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Int. J. Simul. Syst. Sci. Technol.,"In pipeline transportation of slurry, the existing calculation models of critical deposition velocity face the problem of different model forms only suitable for specific conditions. To address this problem, this paper uses improved “shuffled frog leaping algorithm” (SFLA) to optimize the parameters of the computational model in order to calculate critical deposition velocity. This has been found to be more suitable for the specific conditions in the western region of china. Through experimental simulation, the results show that the accuracy of the calculated results obtained by the parameter optimized model of improved SFLA is more accurate than the previous calculation models, which proves the feasibility of the proposed model. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

Expert Syst,"Detecting communities is of great importance in social network analysis. However it is an issue that has not yet been satisfactorily solved, despite the efforts made by interdisciplinary research communities over the past few years, because of the nature of complexity in deciding how community structures should be recognized. In this paper we propose an approach based on cooperative game theory for community detection in social networks. We regard individuals as players, and regard communities as coalitions formed by players, and model community detection problem as the formation and optimization of coalitions. Furthermore, we define coalition profile for players to indicate coalitions that players joined, the order of a coalition profile is defined as the number of coalitions in a coalition profile, and we introduce a utility function to measure preference of coalition profiles. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm to detect a coalition profile with maximal utility function values.

KSII Trans. Internet Inf. Syst.,"The existence of excessively large and too filled network buffers, known as bufferbloat, has recently gained attention as a major performance problem for delay-sensitive applications. Researchers have made three types of suggestions to solve the bufferbloat problem. One is End to End (E2E) congestion control, second is deployment of Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques and third is the combination of above two. However, these solutions either seem impractical or could not obtain good bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) delayed window update mechanism which uses a congestion detection approach to predict the congestion level of networks. When detecting the network congestion is coming, a delayed window update control strategy is adopted to maintain good protocol performance. If the network is non-congested, the mechanism stops work and congestion window is updated based on the original protocol. The simulation experiments are conducted on both high bandwidth and long delay scenario and low bandwidth and short delay scenario. Experiment results show that TCP delayed window update mechanism can effectively improve the performance of the original protocol, decreasing packet losses and queuing delay while guaranteeing transmission efficiency of the whole network. In addition, it can perform good fairness and TCP friendliness. © 2016 KSII.",,20164502998796,,"Wang, Min (1); Yuan, Lingyun (1) ","(1) College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,"716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.1 Probability Theory",,,,,Bandwidth - Congestion control (communication) - Internet protocols - Network protocols - Packet loss - Queueing networks - Queueing theory,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Min(honghewangmin@sina.com.cn) ",10.3837/tiis.2016.10.018,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22881468,"Number: 20090181110053, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2016FA024, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 61561055, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61262071, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61561055), the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (20090181110053), the National Nature Science Fund Project (61262071), Key Project of Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province (2016FA024) and the Ph.D Scientific Research Foundation of Yunnan Normal University (?Research of Adaptive Routing Mechanisms and Transmission Protocols in Software Defined Networking (SDN)?).",,19767277,10.0,"October 31, 2016",English,Transmission control protocol,,28.0,4977-4996,,2016,"Korean Society for Internet Information, 4th Floor, Unsan Building,, 646-6 Yeoksam 1-Dong, Gangnam-Gu,, 135-911, Korea, Republic of",KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems,,TCP delayed window update mechanism for fighting the bufferbloat,,Active Queue Management - Band-width utilization - Bufferbloat - Delay-sensitive applications - Delayed window update - Protocol performance - Queuing delay - Transmission efficiency,10

Prog. React. Kinet. Mech.,"The reaction mechanism of neutral phenol with formaldehyde in aqueous solution was studied theoretically by using the GGA-PW91/DNP+COSMO method. In previous studies, it was found that the water molecules can mediate proton transfer from nitrogen to oxygen, but the results of this study show that water molecules can also catalyse proton transfer from carbon to oxygen. With the mediation of water, the energy barriers were greatly lowered. The calculated energy barriers indicate that the para-position of phenol has higher reactivity than the ortho-position. The reaction occurs in a concerted mechanism. However, the process exhibits asynchronous characteristics, particularly the C-C bond formation precedes the proton transfer and the proton transfer from water molecules to the carbonyl oxygen is ahead of proton abstraction from the benzene ring.",,20162602532705,,"Cao, Ming (1); Li, Taohong (2); Wu, Zhigang (3); Liang, Jiankun (3); Xie, Xiaoguang (4); Du, Guanben (1, 2, 3) ","(1) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing; 210037, China (2) Key Laboratory of Wood Adhesives and Glued Products of Yunnan Province, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming; 650224, China (3) College of Materials Science and Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing; 100083, China (4) Department of Chemistry, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",PRKNAZ,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 932.1 High Energy Physics",,,,,Chemical bonds - Computation theory - Energy barriers - Formaldehyde - Molecules - Oxygen - Phenols - Proton transfer - Solutions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.3184/146867816X14634937797102,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2008CC014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2011GA012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51273163, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31360159, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Programs of National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Nos. 31360159 and 51273163), the Key Programs of Applied Basic Research of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2008CC014 and 2011GA012).",,14686783,2.0,2016,English,Density functional theory,,22.0,144-152,,2016,Science Reviews 2000 Ltd,Progress in Reaction Kinetics and Mechanism,,A computational study on the reaction mechanism of neutral phenol with formaldehyde in aqueous solution,,C-C bond formation - Carbonyl oxygen - Computational studies - Concerted mechanism - Hydroxymethylation - Ortho position - Proton abstraction - Reaction mechanism,41
Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"To make full use of news document structure and the relation among different news documents, a news topic clustering method is proposed of using the relation among document elements. First, the word characteristic weight was calculated by the TF-IDF method based on word frequency statistics to generate document space vector and news document similarity was calculated using text similarity measurement algorithm to obtain the initial news document similarity matrix. Then, the initial similarity matrix was modified with the relation among different news elements as semi-supervised constraint information, the clustering of news documents was realized using Affinity Propagation algorithm, and news topics were extracted from news clusters. As a result, the construction of news topic model was finished. At last, the contrast experiments were performed on manually-annotated news corpus. The results show that the Affinity Propagation clustering methods integrating the relation among document elements can achieve a better effect than those without constraint information. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,20165203193048,,"Hou, Jiaying (1, 2); Yu, Zhengtao (1, 2); Hong, Xudong (1, 2); Li, Feng (3) ","(1) School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650500, China (3) Logistics Science Research Institute of PLA, Beijing; 100166, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921 Mathematics",187379.0,"May 20, 2016 - May 22, 2016","Singapore, Singapore","17th Chinese Lexical Semantics Workshop, CLSW 2016",Cluster analysis - Data mining - Semantics - Vector spaces,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Zhengtao(ztyu@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-49508-8_42,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 61472168, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Contract No.61472168",9783319495071.0,03029743,,2016,English,Clustering algorithms,"Chinese Lexical Semantics - 17th Workshop, CLSW 2016, Revised Selected Papers",15.0,441-448,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Clustering of news topics integrating the relationship among news elements,,Affinity propagation - Affinity propagation clustering - Constraint information - Contrast experiment - Document similarity - Document structure - News topics - Semi-supervised,10085 LNAI
"Proc. Chin. Control Decis. Conf., CCDC","In this paper, a new design of adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems is proposed for the purpose of state tracking and improving convergence speed with both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties. The main feature of the design is that the controller signal is continuous due to the use of integral and employment of second-order sliding mode technique. Nonparametric uncertainties such as norm-bounded nonlinear uncertainties satisfying local Lipschitz condition can be effectively handled. In response to unknown bounded disturbances, a continuous sliding mode adaptive iterative learning control is more robust. By designing a suitable controller and composite energy function, the convergence of tracking error sequence within a small neighborhood of the origin is achieved in the iteration domain. In the end, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ILC scheme. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163602765563,7531031.0,"Sun, Yun-Ping (1); Li, Jin-Xu (1) ","(1) School of Information, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",,,123193.0,"May 28, 2016 - May 30, 2016","Yinchuan, China","28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016",,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/CCDC.2016.7531031,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 2010ZC069, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61164017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61164017) and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province, China (No. 2010ZC069).",9781467397148.0,,,"August 3, 2016",English,,"Proceedings of the 28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016",15.0,473-478,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of the 28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016",,Adaptive iterative learning control via continuous sliding-mode technique with uncertainties,,,
Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"Dried sclerotia of Wolfiporia extensa has a long history of medicinal uses in Asia and also is a traditional snack in Beijing that is called “fuling jiabing”. This study aimed at providing and evaluating data on total Hg contents of sclerotia collected across of the Yunnan land in China, which is generally lacking information. Sclerotia of W. extensa showed a low contamination with Hg when compared to fruiting bodies of many mushroom species. The Hg contents ranged from 0.004 1 to 0.019 mg Hg per kg dry matter with a median value of 0.011 mg·kg-1dry matter and an overall mean value of (0.011±0.004) mg·kg-1dry matter. Mercury content of sclerotia varied between the places of collection in mountainous Yunnan. Assessed intake of Hg by adult eating 50 g of the “average” Yunnan's origin sclerotia contained in the “Fuling jiabing” snack could be between 0.000 009 2 and 0.000 55 mg per capita or between 0.000 003 4 and 0.000 016 mg per kg body mass for a typical adult of mass 60 kg, which is a low intake and Hg intakes would even be much less if taking decoctions of sclerotia. This study has revealed that sclerotia of W. extensa showed a weak contamination with Hg and possible Hg intake eating sclerotia of W. extensa is below health limits. Also Hg intake from the decoctions of W. extensa is much below health limits and “fuling jiabing” snack made of sclerotia of W. extensa provides little Hg. © 2016, Peking University Press.

"Proc. - Int. Congr. Image Signal Process., BioMed. Eng. Inform., CISP-BMEI","Data dimension reduction and classification are the key steps in protein sub-cellular localization. With the rapid development of biological science and technology, a plenty of high dimensional biological data have generated, accompanied by certain noise. How to express high dimensional data in low dimension space and achieve better classification effect have become one of the significant tasks for researchers in the application of protein sub-cellular localization. Both the traditional dimension reduction algorithm of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the popular classifier of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) cannot meet the needs of the current application well if they are simply used without improvements. The aim of LDA is to seek out a projecting line at certain direction letting the projection of samples as far away as possible. However, noise jamming expands the within-class distance and makes the classes uneasily separated even by LDA. Besides, KNN has not taken samples' inequality into consideration primely. Therefore, this paper first uses the noise intensity as a kind of weight in LDA, then improves KNN algorithm by considering the inequality of samples from different classes with a within-class KNN method. Experimental results show that the proposed method by combining the above two improvements gets ideal feasibility and effectiveness in classification through the verification of Jackknife. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171303496348,7853022.0,"Lei, Zhenfeng (1); Wang, Shunfang (1); Xu, Dongshu (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650504, China ",,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 921.5 Optimization Techniques,126492.0,"October 15, 2016 - October 17, 2016","Datong, China","9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, CISP-BMEI 2016",Biomedical engineering - Clustering algorithms - Discriminant analysis - Learning algorithms - Motion compensation - Proteins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shunfang(wangsf_66@hotmail.com) ",10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7853022,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509037100.0,,,"February 13, 2017",English,Nearest neighbor search,"Proceedings - 2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, CISP-BMEI 2016",21.0,1871-1876,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, CISP-BMEI 2016",,Protein sub-cellular localization based on noise-intensity-weighted linear discriminant analysis and an improved k-nearest-neighbor classifier,,Feature expression - K-nearest neighbor classifier - Linear discriminant analysis - Noise intensities - Sub-cellular,
Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol.,"H+-pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) is a primary pyrophosphate (PPi)-energized proton pump to generate electrochemical H+gradient for ATP production and substance translocations across membranes. It plays an important role in stress adaptation that was intensively substantiated by numerous transgenic plants overexpressing H+-PPases yet devoid of any correlated studies pointing to the elite energy plant, Jatropha curcas. Herein, we cloned the full length of J. curcas H+-PPase (JcVP1) complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcription PCR, based on the assembled sequence of its ESTs highly matched to Hevea brasiliensis H+-PPase. This gene encodes a polypeptide of 765 amino acids that was predicted as a K+-dependent H+-PPase evolutionarily closest to those of other Euphorbiaceae plants. Many cis-regulatory elements relevant to environmental stresses, molecular signals, or tissue-specificity were identified by promoter prediction within the 1.5-kb region upstream of JcVP1 coding sequence. Meanwhile, the responses of JcVP1 expression to several common abiotic stresses (salt, drought, heat, cold) were characterized with a considerable accordance with the inherent stress tolerance of J. curcas. Moreover, we found that the heterologous expression of JcVP1 could significantly improve the salt tolerance in both recombinant Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and this effect could be further fortified in yeast by N-terminal addition of a vacuole-targeting signal peptide from the H+-PPase of Trypanosoma cruzi. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,20155001672072,,"Yang, Yumei (1); Luo, Zhu (1); Zhang, Mengru (1); Liu, Chang (1); Gong, Ming (1); Zou, Zhurong (1) ","(1) School of Life Sciences, Engineering Research Center of Sustainable Development and Utilization of Biomass Energy, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Biomass Energy and Environmental Biotechnology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",,461.8.1 Genetic Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 822.3 Food Products,,,,,Escherichia coli - Gene encoding - Polymerase chain reaction - Transcription - Yeast,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zou, Zhurong(zzr09@sina.com) ",10.1007/s12010-015-1944-0,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15590291,,,,02732289,7.0,"April 1, 2016",English,Cloning,,46.0,1273-1285,,2016,Humana Press Inc.,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,,"Molecular Cloning, Expression Analysis, and Functional Characterization of the H+-Pyrophosphatase from Jatropha curcas",,Gene cloning - Heterologous expression - H^+-PPase - Jatropha curcas - Salt tolerance,178

Opt. Mater. Express,"Self-crystallized KTb2F7oxy-fluoride glass ceramics (GC) were successfully manufactured via the traditional melt-quenching method. KTb2F7nanocrystals were already formed after melt-quenching, which is beneficial to the realization of controllable glass crystallization to some degree for affording desirable nano-crystal size and activator partition. Their microstructural and optical properties were systemically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL), luminescence lifetime measurements and X-ray excited luminescence (XEL). Both PL and XEL of GC samples are highly enhanced because more nanocrystals formed and grew up after heat-treatment. Our investigation suggests that transparent KTb2F7glass ceramics may present potential application in X-ray scintillator for X-ray imaging.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Taxi-sharing is an efficient way to improve the utility of taxis by allowing multiple passengers to share a taxi. It also helps to relieve the traffic jams and air pollution. It is common that different users may have different attitudes towards the taxi-sharing scheduling plan, such as the fee to be paid and the additional time to the destination. However, this property has not been paid enough attention to in the traditional taxi-sharing systems-the traditional focus is how to decrease the travel distance.We study the problem of personalized taxi-sharing in this paper, with the consideration of each passenger’s preference in payment, travel time and waiting time. We first define the satisfaction degree of each party involved in the scheduling plan, based on which two goals are defined to evaluate the overall plan, including MaxMin and MaxSum. Subsequently, we devise a two-phase framework to deal with this problem. The statistical information gathered during the offline phase will be used to hasten query processing during the online phase. Experimental reports upon the real dataset illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20161502216095,,"Duan, Xiaoyi (1); Jin, Cheqing (1); Wang, Xiaoling (1); Zhou, Aoying (1); Yue, Kun (2) ","(1) School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Institute for Data Science and Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,431 Air Transportation - 432 Highway Transportation - 433 Railroad Transportation - 434 Waterway Transportation - 662.1 Automobiles - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.3 Database Systems - 912.2 Management,172739.0,"April 16, 2016 - April 19, 2016","Dallas, TX, United states","21st International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications, DASFAA 2016",Database systems - Query processing - Scheduling - Taxicabs - Traffic congestion - Travel time,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jin, Cheqing(cqjin@sei.ecnu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-32049-6_28,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 14ZZ045, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; Number: 14ZR1412600, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; Number: 2012CB316203, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61370101, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61402180, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472345, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: ZF1213, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1501252, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1401256, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Our research is supported by the 973 program of China (No. 2012CB316203), NSFC (U1401256, 61370101, U1501252, 61402180 and 61472345), Shanghai Knowledge Service Platform Project (No. ZF1213), Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(14ZZ045), and Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (No. 14ZR1412600)",9783319320489.0,03029743,,2016,English,Time sharing systems,"Database Systems for Advanced Applications - 21st International Conference, DASFAA 2016, Proceedings",20.0,451-465,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Real-time personalized taxi-sharing,,Effectiveness and efficiencies - Real time - Satisfaction degrees - Sharing systems - Statistical information - Traffic jams - Two phase - Waiting-time,9643
Carbon,"This study investigated the regeneration of p-nitrophenol (PNP) saturated activated carbon fiber (ACF) by a novel electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) approach, which aimed to simultaneously regenerate exhausted ACF and mineralize desorbed pollutants by coupling conventional cathodic regeneration with ozonation. PNP-saturated ACF was attached to a carbon-polytetrafluorethylene cathode, which was then applied a current to drive cathodic desorption of pre-loaded PNP and electrochemical generation of H2O2from O2in the sparged ozone generator effluent (O2and O3gas mixture). The electro-generated H2O2then reacts with sparged O3to yield OH, which can rapidly mineralize the desorbed pollutants (PNP and its derivatives). After 3 h regeneration, the E-peroxone process restored ∼95% of the ACF adsorption capacity, and effectively mineralized the desorbed pollutants. In addition, the E-peroxone regeneration did not considerably modify the structural and chemical properties of ACF. Consequently, the ACF exhibited no evident decline in the adsorption capacity after twelve cycles of PNP adsorption and E-peroxone regeneration. These results indicate that the E-peroxone regeneration can successfully achieve the goal of simultaneous regeneration of saturated ACFs and mineralization of desorbed pollutants, and may thus provide an attractive and viable alternative for the regeneration of organic-saturated ACs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Hupo Kexue/J. Lake Sc.,"To investigate the spatial distribution of nutrients in the inflow rivers and their influence on the eutrophication of Lake Dianchi, water samples were collected from Lake Dianchi and four different types of the inflow rivers during July of 2014. The four different types of rivers were named as the river in the urban areas, the river in the combination of urban and rural areas, the river dominated by non-point source pollution, and the river dominated by sewage pollution in town and village. The results indicated that, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen concentrations from the four inflow rivers were very high. The mean concentrations of TN and TP from these inflow rivers were in the order: rivers dominated by non-point source pollution (Dahe River) > rivers dominated by sewage pollution in town and village (Chaihe River) > rivers in the combination of urban and rural areas (Baoxiang River) > rivers in the urban areas (Panlong River). The TN and TP concentrations from the rivers dominated by non-point source pollution (Dahe River) were the highest. In summer, it is clearly that the TN and TP concentrations increased from the upstream to the downstream in all four inflow rivers, which means that the TN and TP constantly accumulated. The ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus showed that both TN and TP were sufficient for algal growth from all inflow rivers in summer, but the algal growth in Lake Dianchi was limited by TN. The TN and TP concentrations from the southeastern inflow rivers were higher than those from the northwestern rivers, but the law was opposite in Lake Dianchi. Therefore, we speculated that the internal pollutant sources are the major cause of eutrophication of Lake Dianchi. The deeply researches should focus on the internal pollutions for the study on the eutrophication of Lake Dianchi in the future. © 2016 by Journal of Lake Sciences.",Open Access,20163502745733,,"Yu, Liyan (1); Yang, Hao (1); Huang, Changchun (1); Huang, Tao (1); Yu, Yanhong (2); Jiang, Quanliang (1); Liu, Daqing (1); Li, Shuaidong (1) ","(1) Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing; 210023, China (2) Environmental Science Research Institute of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650032, China ",,452.1 Sewage - 453 Water Pollution - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Eutrophication - Lake pollution - Lakes - Nitrogen - Phosphorus - Pollution - Rivers - Rural areas - Sewage,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Changchun(huangchangchun@njnu.edu.cn) ",10.18307/2016.0505,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10035427,5.0,"September 6, 2016",Chinese,River pollution,,50.0,961-971,,2016,Science Press,Hupo Kexue/Journal of Lake Sciences,,Characteristic of nitrogen and phosphorous pollution in Lake Dianchi and its inflow rivers in summer,,Ammonium nitrogen - Inflow rivers - Mean concentrations - Nitrogen and phosphorus - Non-point source pollution - Pollutant sources - Sewage pollutions - Urban and rural areas,28

Proc IEEE Power Eng Soc Trans Distrib Conf,"This paper presents a new method to recognize the noise characteristics of power transformer. First, frame division and windowing are applied to pre-process the noise signals. Then Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed to calculate the feature vectors of noise signals for high accuracy. Finally, the vector quantization (VQ) models are built to recognize the noise characteristics. The noise signals of some 10kV transformer are measured when the core is loosened in different degree. It is shown that the proposed MFCC is capable of describing the noise features of transformer accurately. The results of noise recognition by VQ are agreed well with the preset condition of core. The obtained results are helpful for the optimum design and mechanical condition assessment of power transformer. © 2016 IEEE.",,20164202923533,7519923.0,"Yan, B. (1); Qian, G.Q. (1); Wang, F.H.

Huagong Jinzhan/Chem. Ind. Eng. Prog.,"In this paper, the gold mine tailings collected from Dali Bai autonomous, Heqing prefecture, Yunnan province, China were investigated by electrokinetic remediation. The effect of different anode electrode solution, permeable reactive barrier (PRB) materials and placement of the PRB on the removal rate of copper was studied. The morphological changes of copper in the electrokinetic remediation were also investigated. The percent of water soluble species, acid extractable fraction, Fe-Mn oxides species, organic matter species and residual species in total copper content were 0.7%, 5.8%, 40.9%, 9.7%, and 42.9% respectively. The results indicated that the removal rate of water soluble species, acid extractable fraction, Fe-Mn oxides species can reach 66.5%, 51.5% and 58.5% respectively when the anode electrode solution was 0.1 mol/L citric acid solution and the PRB was coconut shell activated carbon and placed in 10cm away from the anode. Unfortunately there was almost no effect about organic matter species and residual species of copper. However, there were few reports about the research on electrokinetic remediation of mine tailings. This study can provide a reference for related research. © 2016, Chemical Industry Press.

Tien Tzu Hsueh Pao,"For an issue of the traditional fourth order partial differential equation(fourth order equation)algorithm caused edge leakage of image, a leakage compensation method is proposed based on edge detection theory. Firstly the noise image is preprocessed by a nonlinear bilateral filter to obtain the better edge preservation image. Based on the feature of the gradient operator on the detection of image edge and the squared two-norm of gradient difference which is between the result image and the preprocessed image, a constraint item is builded. Then the constraint item is added to the corresponding energy functional of fourth order equation. Finally, to adaptively adjust the edge preservation constraint item and improve the performance of edge preservation, an adaptive lagrange multiplier which is based on image local variance is constructed. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only inherits the advantage of traditional fourth order equation, but also enhances its ability of edge preservation. © 2016, Chinese Institute of Electronics.

Rock Soil Mech,"Mesoscopic seepage field of real soil is simulated based on lattice Boltzmann method. In this simulation, the basic model D2Q9 is used; and the inlet and outlet boundaries are constructed by setting the non-equilibrium extrapolation format. The soil particles boundary as well as left and right waterproof boundaries are set by the bounce-back format. At first, the data denoted by physical units from experiments are transformed into lattice units. According to data structure generated by CT scanned slices, the corresponding calculation program is applied to simulate mesoscopic seepage field of real soil. Finally, the results of lattice units are transform into physical units once again. The variation of seepage velocity is analyzed; and the whole and partial distributions of seepage field are obtained. The results show that: 1) Seepage velocity U finally reaches a relatively stable figure in pore channels over time. Accurate time T is obtained from the beginning of seepage to the steady-state of seepage. 2) The average seepage velocity gradually decreases along with the negative direction of y axis from the inlet boundary; and it is less than the average seepage velocity in inlet boundary. 3) The quantity of seepage is dominated by the connectivity and pore size of channels. The maximum seepage velocity is concentrated in a narrow channel. The velocity in closed pore channel and pore is zero. Lattice Boltzmann method is effective in simulating two dimensional CT scanned slice and can be used to research the mechanism of real seepage field quantitatively and accurately. © 2016, Academia Sinica.

Huagong Xuebao,"In order to analyze the performance of the spiral groove dry gas seal considered effects of both real gas and slip flow simultaneously, the modified pressure governing equations of the seal based on the narrow groove theory by taking the effective viscosity coefficient instead of the gas dynamic viscosity and the real gas Virial state equation instead of the ideal gas state equation. N2, H2, CO2were taken as examples. The leakage, the pressure at groove root radius and the opening force of the seal were calculated. Meanwhile, the leakage, the pressure at groove root radius and the opening force under the condition of ideal gas without slip flow, ideal gas with slip flow, real gas without slip flow and real gas with slip flow were compared, respectively. The results showed that the effect of slip flow made the leakage increase, and the pressure at groove root radius and the opening force decrease. The effect of real gas made the leakage, the pressure at groove root radius and opening force of susceptible compressed gas (Z1) decrease. With increasing sealed pressure po, the effect of slip flow was reduced, while that of the real gas was strengthened. Under the condition of low sealed pressure, the slip flow effect was significant.

World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"Nicotine in tobacco is harmful to health and the environment, so there is an environmental requirement to remove nicotine from tobacco and tobacco wastes. In this study, the biotransformation of nicotine by Rhodococcus sp. Y22 was investigated, and three metabolites (NIC1, NIC4 and NIC5) were isolated by column separation, preparative TLC and solid plate’s method, respectively. NIC1 was identified as 6-hydoxynicotine based on the results of NMR, MS, HPLC–UV and HRESIMS analysis; NIC4 was a novel compound and identified as 5-(3-methyl-[1,3]oxazinan-2-ylidene)-5H-pyridin-2-one based on the results of NMR, MS and UV analysis; NIC5 was identified as nicotine blue based on the results of NMR and MS analysis. Meanwhile, two metabolites NIC2 and NIC3 were identified as 6-hydroxy-N-methylmyosmine and 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine by HRESIMS analysis, respectively. According to these metabolites, the possible pathway of nicotine degradation by Rhodococcus sp. Y22 was proposed. The nicotine can be transformed to nicotine blue through two pathways (A and B), and 6-hydroxy-N-methylmyosmine is the key compound, which can be converted to 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine (pathway A) and 5-(3-methyl-[1,3]oxazinan-2-ylidene)-5H-pyridin-2-one (pathway B), respectively. Moreover, the encoding gene of nicotine dehydrogenase, ndh, was amplified from Rhodococcus sp. Y22, and its transcriptional level could be up-regulated obviously under nicotine induction. Our studies reported the key metabolites and possible biotransformation pathway of nicotine in Rhodococcus sp. Y22, and provided new insights into the microbial metabolism of nicotine. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,20164002865745,188.0,"Gong, Xiaowei (1, 2); Ma, Guanghui (1, 3); Duan, Yanqing (2); Zhu, Donglai (2); Chen, Yongkuan (2); Zhang, Ke-Qin (1); Yang, Jinkui (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) R & D Center of China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial Co., Ltd., Kunming; 650024, China (3) Yunnan Comtestor Co., Ltd., Kunming; 650106, China ",WJMBEY,461.8 Biotechnology - 461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products,,,,,Biodegradation - Biomolecules - Gene encoding - Metabolism - Metabolites - Tobacco - Transcription,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Jinkui(jinkui960@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11274-016-2147-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15730972,,,,09593993,11.0,"November 1, 2016",English,Nicotine,,35.0,,,2016,Springer Netherlands,World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology,,Biodegradation and metabolic pathway of nicotine in Rhodococcus sp.

Rock Soil Mech,"To explore the hydraulic conductivity of lacustrine peaty soil in plateau areas, the permeability coefficients of 20 groups of soil samples from 6 sites were measured under one-dimensional compression conditions through oedometer tests. The effects of loading time, stress level, loss-on-ignition and residual fiber contents on the permeability coefficients are analyzed. The experimental results show that under the conditions of separately loading, permeability coefficient decreases with the elapsing time and tends to be stabilized in about ten days; under the conditions of stepwise loading, the permeability coefficient decreases nonlinearly with increasing consolidation pressure, and the curves of kv-lgσv' resemble a reverse 'S'. A permeability model for lacustrine peaty soil in plateau areas can be represented by expression e-lgkv, and the relations between the permeability index (Ck) and initial void ratio e0can be described by Ck=0.25 e0. The relationships among initial permeability coefficient kv0and loss-on-ignition wi, residual fiber content wfand e0are more discrete, and there clearly exits a positive correlation among Ck, wi, wfand the initial water content w0. Through scanning electron microscope, the mechanism of the peaty soil permeability is discussed from the pore characteristics of soil. © 2016, Science Press.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"A dual-signalling electrochemical approach has been developed towards aconitine based on competitive host-guest interaction by selecting methylene blue (MB) and p-sulfonated calix[8]arene functionalized single-walled carbon nanohorns (SCX8-SWCNHs) as the 'reporter pair'. Upon the presence of aconitine to the performed SCX8-SWCNHs·MB complex, the MB molecules are displaced by aconitine. This results in a decreased oxidation peak current of MB and the appearance of an oxidation peak of aconitine, and the changes of these signals correlate linearly with the concentration of aconitine. A linear response range of 1.00-10.00 μM for aconitine with a low detection limit of 0.18 μM (S/N=3) was obtained by using the proposed method. This method could be successfully utilized to detect aconitine in serum samples. This dual-signalling sensor can provide more sensitive target recognition and will have important applications in the sensitive and selective electrochemical detection of aconitine. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162002389457,,"Yang, Long (1); Ran, Xin (1); Cai, Le (1); Li, Yucong (1); Zhao, Hui (2); Li, Can-Peng (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",BBIOE4,761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Aromatic compounds - Carbon - Nanohorns,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Hui(zhaohui@yun.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.079,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,"Number: 2014RA022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21565029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21565029 ,) and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2014RA022 ), People's Republic of China.

Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult.,"Abscisic acid (ABA) 8′-hydroxylase is the key enzyme in the oxidative catabolism of ABA. CYP707A genes encode (+)-ABA 8′-hydroxylases that are involved in fruit ripening and abiotic stress responses. However, there are limited reports on the functions of CYP707A genes in mulberry. This study analyzed the transcriptional expression of CYP707A genes during fruit development and their response to exogenous ABA and uniconazole (UNI) treatment. Additionally, the expression patterns of CYP707A under stress conditions were explored in mulberry. We obtained six CYP707A gene (MnCYP707A1-MnCYP707A6) sequences from Morus notabilis genome database. Multiple sequence alignment results showed high conservation within the MnCYP707A genes. The expression profiles of these genes during fruit development and under stress conditions were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). During fruit development, the expression levels of MaCYP707A1, MaCYP707A3, MaCYP707A5, and MaCYP707A6 were higher at the primary stage and then sharply declined to a lower level at the late stage. The expression of MaCYP707A1 in the fruit quickly declined at 1 d after 50 mmol/L UNI treatment. In addition, under Sodium chloride (NaCl) (0.3 % (w/v) at germination stage and 0.6 % (w/v) at seedling stage) or polyethylene glyco (PEG) 6000 (5 % (w/v) at germination stage and 20 % (w/v) at seedling stage) stress, most of the MaCYP707A genes were up-regulated, but displayed different patterns. Tissue-specific patterns of the CYP707A family appear to be universal under stress conditions. In a short, MaCYP707A genes play overlapping roles in ABA catabolism and MaCYP707A1 may be the key gene expressed during fruit maturation. Most of these genes were induced by abiotic stress, and various expression patterns were observed among the MaCYP707A in multiple mulberry tissues at different growth periods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,20163002647290,,"Cai, Yuxiang (1); Zhu, Panpan (1); Liu, Changying (1); Zhao, Aichun (1); Yu, Jian (1); Wang, Chuanhong (1); Li, Zhengang (2); Huang, Ping (2); Yu, Maode (1) ","(1) College of Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing; 400715, China (2) The Sericultural and Apicultural Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Mengzi; Yunnan; 661100, China ",PTCEDJ,444 Water Resources - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 801.2 Biochemistry - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products,,,,,Cultivation - Drought - Encoding (symbols) - Fruits - Metabolism - Plants (botany) - Polymerase chain reaction - Signal encoding - Sodium chloride - Tissue,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Maode(yumd@163.com) ",10.1007/s11240-016-1047-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15735044,,,,01676857,1.0,"October 1, 2016",English,Gene expression,,58.0,237-249,,2016,Springer Netherlands,"Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture",,Characterization and expression analysis of cDNAs encoding abscisic acid 8′-hydroxylase during mulberry fruit maturation and under stress conditions,,ABA catabolism - CYP707A - Hydroxylases - Mulberry - Salt stresss - Uniconazoles,127

However, its performance can not be significantly improved duo to the limited discriminative power of the SIFT descriptors. To address the problem, covariance matrices as region descriptors are introduced to incorporate with the SIFTs. For computing the distance between them, covariances are transformed to LECM features by matrix logarithm operation. Moreover, exponential weights are imposed on the pooled features to enhance the performance of linear kernel SVM.

Phase Transitions,"The influences of microwave heating on the phase transformation of titania slag were systematically investigated. The thermal stability, surface chemical functional groups and microstructure of the titania slag before and after microwave heating, at a temperature of 950 °C for 60 min, were also analyzed using thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG-DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectrum and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The TG-DSC analysis revealed that the phase transformation of the titania slag from anatase TiO2to rutile TiO2occurred between 750 and 1000 °C. The FT-IR rustles demonstrate that the banding form of Ti4+, Ti3+and Ti2+ions and the methyl groups on the surface of the titania slag has changed and a new chemical bond Ti–OH was formed. The results of SEM showed that a large number of regulation rutile TiO2crystals were found on the surface of the microwave-treated samples and the synthetic rutile has been synthesized successfully using microwave heating. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,20154401464471,,"Chen, Guo (1, 2); Chen, Jin (1, 2); Peng, Jinhui (1, 2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Resource Clean Conversion in Ethnic Regions of Education Department of Yunnan, Joint Research Centre for International Cross-border Ethnic Regions Biomass Clean Utilization in Yunnan, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China (2) Key Laboratory of Chemistry in Ethnic Medicinal Resources, State Ethnic Affairs Commission & Ministry of Education, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",PHTRDP,482.2 Minerals - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Chemical stability - Differential thermal analysis - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Functional groups - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Oxide minerals - Phase transitions - Scanning electron microscopy - Slags - Thermogravimetric analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Guo(guochen@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1080/01411594.2015.1089575,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10290338,,,,01411594,9.0,"September 1, 2016",English,Titanium dioxide,,10.0,894-901,,2016,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Phase Transitions,,An investigation of phase transformation of titania slag using microwave heating,,Anatase TiO2 - Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy - Methyl group - Rutile TiO2 - Structural performance - Surface chemicals - Synthetic rutile - Titania slag,89

J. Nano. Res.,"To date, intensive efforts have been devoted in the synthesis of various nanomaterials as photothermal agent in the first near-infrared (NIR) window (650-950 nm). Although the NIR-II window (1000-1350 nm) is recognized to offer more efficient tissue penetration and higher permissible exposure to excitation light, the corresponding photothermal agents have been scant. Here, we report a binary surfactant seeded growth method for high yield synthesis of long AuNRs (LAuNRs) as an efficient NIR-II photothermal agent. The as-synthesized LAuNRs with aspect ratio of 6.7 shows strong surface plasmon resonance band at 1064 nm, and demonstrates high photothermal conversion efficiency and excellent photothermal stability. When the AuNRs aqueous dispersion is covered with a 6 mm thick pork tissue as a model of biological tissues, its temperature can still be increased by 13.1 °C under a 1064 nm 1.0 W/cm2 laser irradiation. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the LAuNRs as an efficient photothermal agent in the NIR-II window. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",,20161302143568,,"Zhou, Rui (1); Wu, Zhengwei (2); Sun, Zhanhui (1); Su, Xiaofei (3) ","(1) Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China (2) Tsinghua University Hefei Institute for Public Safety Research, Hefei, Anhui, China (3) Yunnan Aerospace Industry Company, China ",,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 547.1 Precious Metals - 761 Nanotechnology - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Aspect ratio - Gold - Nanorods - Plasmons - Surface plasmon resonance - Tissue,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.4028/www.scientific.net/JNanoR.40.180,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),16619897,,,,16625250,,2016,English,Infrared devices,,37.0,180-189,,2016,Trans Tech Publications Ltd,Journal of Nano Research,,Synthesis of long gold nanorods as an efficient photothermal agent in the second near-infrared window,,Gold nanorod - High yield synthesis - Near Infrared - Photo-thermal - Photothermal conversion efficiencies - Photothermal stability - Photothermal therapy - Second near-infrared windows,40
Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"In this report, a diamine ligand having an electron-pulling group in its conjugation plane was designed. A methyl group was connected with this diamine ligand, hoping to further increase its steric hindrance. Its Cu(I) complex was synthesized and characterized by NMR, single crystal analysis and photophysical analysis. There was a distorted tetrahedral coordination field in this Cu(I) complex. Its onset electronic transition owned a mixed character of metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer which suffered from bad geometric relaxation. To limit this geometric relaxation and improve emissive performance, this Cu(I) complex was doped into a polymer host through electrospinning technique. Photophysical comparison between solid state sample, solution sample and composite samples indicated that excited state geometric relaxation was effectively limited by polymer immobilization effect, resulting in improved emissive performance, such as emission blue shift, long emission decay lifetime and better photostability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Comput Mater Sci,"Based on the structure characteristics of aluminum foam sandwich (AFS) panels, two-dimensional random models with different relative densities are created by combing C++ and ANSYS/LS-DYNA software in this paper. Under different strain rates, compression behavior and strain-rate effect of AFS panels are investigated on the basis of the established finite element models. It is found that stress-strain curves of AFS panels are made up of three stages, namely elastic stage, plateau stage and densification stage. Moreover, the research results also confirm that the strain-rate effect of AFS panels is related to strain-rate sensitivity of matrix materials and effect of micro-inertia for AFS panels. With the increase of the relative density, the strain-rate effect of AFS panels is more obvious. Through comparison and analysis, the obtained results in this work are in good agreement with other research results, which confirms the feasibility and rationality of the models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Intl. J. Mach. Learn. Cybern.,"Incomplete contexts are a kind of formal contexts in which information about the relationship between some objects and attributes is not available or is lost. Knowledge discovery in incomplete contexts is of interest because such databases are frequently encountered in the real world. The existing work has proposed an approach to construct the approximate concept lattice of an incomplete context. Generally speaking, however, the huge nodes in the approximate concept lattice make the obtained conceptual knowledge difficult to be understood and weaken the efficiency of the related decision-making analysis as well. Motivated by this problem, this paper puts forward a method to compress the approximate concept lattice using K-medoids clustering. To be more concrete, firstly we discuss the accuracy measure of approximate concepts in incomplete contexts. Secondly, the similarity measure between approximate concepts is presented via the importance degrees of an object and an attribute. And then the approximate concepts of an incomplete context are clustered by means of K-medoids clustering. Moreover, we define the so-called K-deletion transformation to achieve the task of compressing the approximate concept lattice. Finally, we conduct some experiments to perform a robustness analysis of the proposed clustering method with respect to the parameters Ε and K, and show the average rate of compression of approximate concept lattice. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20162902601196,,"Li, Caiping (1); Li, Jinhai (2); He, Miao (1) ","(1) Department of Mathematics, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji; Shaanxi; 721013, China (2) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",,903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 912.2 Management,,,,,Decision making,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Jinhai(jhlixjtu@163.com) ",10.1007/s13042-014-0288-3,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1868808X,,,,18688071,4.0,"August 1, 2016",English,Information analysis,,45.0,539-552,,2016,Springer Verlag,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,,Concept lattice compression in incomplete contexts based on K-medoids clustering,,Concept Lattices - Conceptual knowledge - Decision making analysis - Importance degrees - Incomplete context - K-medoids clustering - Robustness analysis - Similarity measure,7

Fuhe Cailiao Xuebao,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), due to their extremely high mechanical performance, excellent electrical and thermal properties, have been regarded as ideally reinforcement phase of composites. CNTs reinforced metal matrix composites have become a very important research area. However, due to the issues of the compatibility between CNTs and metal matrix, the difficulty to control dispersion of reinforcement in spatial and the high ampacity but relatively low conductivity of CNTs, the electrical properties of CNTs reinforced metal matrix composites do not show significantly enhancement and the electrical and mechanical properties are difficult to be balanced, the overall research is still in infancy. We discuss the research status of CNTs reinforced metal matrix composites from the aspects of pretreatment, processing method and mechanism of electrical conduction, as well as the outlook for the future development trend in this area. © 2016, BUAA Culture Media Group Ltd.

J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci.,"For intensive study on the catastrophic evolution from instability of tailing dam, an analytical method based on the theory of dissipative structure is proposed to examine the evolution characteristics of instability and catastrophe of tailing dam. The theory of dissipative structure has been extensively applied and developed, particularly in the field of nonlinear science. The nonlinear behavior of strengthened creep during the above evolution is discussed and the process of instability and catastrophe of tailing dam is analyzed by the dissipation theory, which indicates the evolution of failure surface is the outcome of accumulated and strengthened fractures that cause sliding. The finite element code of ABAQUS is used to simulate the evolution of sliding surface and the obtained results are consistent with the one from the theory of dissipative structure. Findings from this study presents clearer understanding on the evolution of instability and catastrophe of the tailing dam, thus the mechanism of tailing dam instability is intensively explored. © Copyright 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",,20163102675740,,"Yuan, Liwei (1); Li, Sumin (1); Wang, Guangjin (1); Chen, Yuming (1) ","(1) Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",,441.1 Dams - 914 Safety Engineering - 921 Mathematics,,,,,ABAQUS - Disasters - Safety engineering - Stability,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Sumin ",10.1166/jctn.2016.4585,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15461963,"Number: 10-101, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing; Number: KKSY201421072, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 41202229, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51234004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of provincial people training project of Kunming University of Science and Technology (No: KKSY201421072), the State Administration of Work Safety Production major accident prevention technology projects focus on key technologies (No: 10-101), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51234004 and 41202229).",,15461955,4.0,April 2016,English,Dams,,20.0,2354-2358,,2016,American Scientific Publishers,Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience,,Catastrophic evolution analysis from instability of tailing dam,,Dam-breaks - Dissipative structure - Evolution analysis - Evolution characteristics - Finite element codes - Nonlinear behavior - Tailing dam - Theory of dissipative structures,13
TMS Annu Meet,"The gasification reactivity of PC (petroleum coke), strengthened by addition of different potassium carbonate proportions using different grinding medium, was investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Results showed that the gasification reactivity of PC not only increased with the increase of catalyst-loaded, but also showed the effective improvement by anhydrous alcohol. The PC was mixed with potassium carbonate [K2CO3] catalyst at 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.0% and 1.5%, and then ground wet with distilled water. The CO2-gasification rate of PC was only 77.35%, 80.55%, 84.07% and 85.88% under the gasification temperature 1100°C and holding time 120 min, at different K2CO3respectively. However, when the PC was ground in anhydrous alcohol at the same condition of catalyst-loading, the gasification rate of PC reached 95.43%, 96.63%, 95.50%. and 95.61% at the holding time of 108 min, 101 min, 74 min and 35 min, respectively.

Metall Mat Trans B Process Metall Mat Process Sci,"In this work, the author pointed out that empirically to compare the molecular interaction volume model (MIVM) with thermodynamic definition of excess Gibbs energy would result in the incorrect expressions of enthalpy of mixing and excess entropy. The correct expressions of molar and partial molar enthalpies of mixing and excess entropies from the MIVM are consistent thermodynamically and are suggested for replacing their past incorrect ones. The simplification of Zi = Z = 10 is verified to be feasible by the average errors of fitting in the binary liquid alloys M-P (M = Cr, Fe, and Mn) and of predicting in the ternary liquid alloys Fe-Cr-P and Fe-Mn-P by using two coordination numbers of phosphorus ZP = 3.04 and ZP = 8.96.

Atmos. Res.,"This study investigated the variations of stable isotopes (δ18O and δD) in precipitation at Deqin on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that correlations between stable isotopes in precipitation and temperature vary during different seasons. In comparison, an apparent inverse correlation between stable isotopes and precipitation amount exists throughout different seasons. Hence, the 'amount effect' appears to have significantly controlled the stable isotope variations in precipitation over the entire sampling period, rather than the 'temperature effect'. The overall temporal variations of δ18O and δD in precipitation from Deqin are similar to those from a southern station at Xishuangbanna. Both stations demonstrate considerably depleted precipitation δ18O values in the summer as a consequence of intense Asian summer monsoon activities. However, at Xishuangbanna, the occurrences of the timing and duration of the depleted δ18O values, as well as the negative surface lift index values, occur earlier and last longer than those at Deqin. These results indicate that the Asian summer monsoon onset is later and that the duration of the monsoon activities is shorter at Deqin relative to Xishuangbanna. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20155101695715,,"Yu, Wusheng (1, 2); Wei, Feili (1, 3); Ma, Yaoming (1, 2); Liu, Wenjie (4); Zhang, Yingyan (5); Luo, Lun (1); Tian, Lide (1, 2); Xu, Baiqing (1, 2); Qu, Dongmei (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Tibetan Environment Changes and Land Surface Processes, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China (2) CAS Center for Excellence in Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China (3) Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (4) Key Laboratory of Tropical Forest Ecology, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Yunnan; 666303, China (5) Deqin Meteorological Station, China Meteorological Administration, Diqing, Yunnan; 674500, China ",,641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Atmospheric thermodynamics - Precipitation (chemical) - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Wusheng(yuws@itpcas.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.atmosres.2015.11.013,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FA022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014HB042, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: XDB03030207, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 91437110, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 91337212, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41371086, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: CMA, Sponsor: China Meteorological Administration; ","This work is jointly supported by Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB03030207 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 91437110 , 91337212 , and 41371086 ), and Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (Grant Nos. 2014HB042 and 2013FA022 ).

J Alloys Compd,"The present work attempts to investigate the formation-decomposition reaction of the manganese ore. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the decomposition reaction of the manganese ore was feasible by adjusting the roasting temperature and duration time. The peak intensity of Mn3O4phase of the microwave heated products increases with the increase of microwave heating temperature. The microwave treated manganese ore appears irregular with numerous small cracks and pits, which was caused by the decomposition reaction of MnCO3phase and CaCO3phase under microwave heating. It was concluded that microwave heating can be applied effectively and efficiently to the calcination processes of the manganese ore. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"It is crucial for assessing the eutrophication risk of lake by analyzing the phosphorus (P) balance of lake watershed quantitively. A mass balance method was used to calculate P balance of both Yangzonghai lake watershed and the lake itself in one year. The imported P load was 725.1 t in 2010, while the exported P load was 317.3 t, which indicated that 56.2 % (407.8 t yr−1) of P was retained in the lake watershed. Such a high retention load implied that the lake, which was mesotrophic, was under great pressure of further eutrophication. Among all the input pathways, the largest P input contributor was fertilizer, contributing 679.0 t P and accounting for 93.6 % of input P, followed by atmospheric deposition (44.7 t P, 6.2 %).

Inf Sci,"In this study, we propose a new method for multifocus image fusion by combining with the structure tensors of mixed order differentials and the multiscale neighborhood. In this method, the structure tensor of an integral differential is utilized to detect the high frequency regions and the structure tensor of the fractional differential is used to detect the low frequency regions. To improve the performance of the fusion method, we propose a new focus measure based on the multiscale neighborhood technique to generate the initial fusion decision maps by exploiting the advantages of different scales. Next, based on the multiscale neighborhood technique, a post-processing method is used to update the initial fusion decision maps. During the fusion process, the pixels located in the focused inner regions are selected to produce the fused image. In order to avoid discontinuities in the transition zone between the focused and defocused regions, we propose a new 'averaging' scheme based on the fusion decision maps at different scales. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed the conventional multifocus image fusion methods in terms of both their subjective and objective quality. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Zongguo Gonglu Xuebao,"To forecast the travel time of vehicles in intersection group, the distribution and concurrence features of urban traffic system were used to build the modular and hierarchical TCPN model by using timed colored Petri nets firstly. The proposed model considered input/output road section traffic flow, intersection traffic flow, signal control and TCPN model for vehicles intersection group. Then the monitor of the model obtained the vehicle urgent degree, the timestamp of input/output of intersections, the timestamp of input/output of selected library, sink capacity and other state information in the simulation process. According to the obtained information, the fuzzy reasoning algorithm of average speed of vehicles was proposed based on vehicle urgent degree and density of the traffic flow to achieve the prediction for the average speed of vehicles and vehicle travel time in free travel section. The results show that the simulation prediction method based on the combination of timed colored Petri nets traffic flow model and fuzzy reasoning algorithm can predict a reasonable travel time of vehicles in intersections. Compared with Kalman filter prediction method, the proposed method shows that mean-absolute-percentage errors and accumulated root-mean-squared errors of predicted travel time decreased by 14.33% and 22.98%, respectively. © 2016, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Water Sci. Technol.,"Effective control of nitrogen and phosphorus in secondary effluent can reduce or avoid the eutrophication of receiving water bodies. Two denitrifying biofilters (DNBFs) packed with different sizes of quartz sands combined with micro-coagulation were operated for simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the secondary effluent. The quartz sand size in one DNBF was 2-4 mm (DNBFS), and in the other was 4-6 mm (DNBFL). In both DNBFs, methanol was used as the electron donor and different organic carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios were applied. Under C/N ratios of 1.5, 1.25, and 0.75 g/g, the nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) removal percentages were 73%, 77%, and 50% in DNBFS, and 43%, 25%, and 21% in DNBFL; the effluent total phosphorus concentrations were 0.15, 0.14, and 0.18 mg/L in DNBFS, and 0.29, 0.35, and 0.24 mg/L in DNBFL. The performance of both biofilters was quite stable within a backwashing cycle. The NO3-N reduction rates were 1.31, 1.10, and 0.48 mg/(min) in DNBFS, and 0.97, 0.27, and 0.10 mg/(min) in DNBFL. For biomass detached from both biofilters, their denitrifying activities were similar. Biofilm biomass in DNBFS was higher than that in DNBFL, inducing a high denitrification efficiency in DNBFS. © IWA Publishing 2016.",Open Access,20162402494230,,"Wei, Nan (1); Shi, Yunhong (1); Wu, Guangxue (1); Hu, Hongying (1); Guo, Yumei (2); Wu, Yihui (2); Wen, Hui (2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control (MARC) of Shenzhen, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, Guangdong; 518055, China (2) Kunming Dianchi Water Group Co.

Nanotechnology,"The growth of Ge quantum dots (QDs) using the ion beam sputtering deposition technique has been successfully conducted directly on single-layer graphene supported by SiO2/Si substrate. The results show that the morphology and size of Ge QDs on graphene can be modulated by tuning the Ge coverage. Charge transfer behavior, i.e. doping effect in graphene has been demonstrated at the interface of Ge/graphene. Compared with that of traditional Ge dots grown on Si substrate, the positions of both corresponding photoluminescence (PL) peaks of Ge QDs/graphene hybrid structure undergo a large red-shift, which can probably be attributed to the lack of atomic intermixing and the existence of surface states in this hybrid material. According to first-principles calculations, the Ge growth on the graphene should follow the so-called Volmer-Weber mode instead of the Stranski-Krastanow one which is observed generally in the traditional Ge QDs/Si system.

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"Solar water heaters are widely used in urban and rural China. The Home Appliances to the Countryside program from government further expands its application in rural areas. In the end of 2010, there were 168 million square meters of installed solar heaters, with an annual primary energy saving of 20 Mtce. The total installation is very likely to reach 250 million square meters in 2015 and at least 600 million square meters in 2020. In the 2009 Copenhagen UN Climate Change Summit, president Hu Jintao pledged to the international community to reduce the CO2intensity of the economy by 40% to 45% by 2020 on the baseline level of 2005. Meanwhile, the share of non-fossil energy is also expected to rise to 15%. Application of solar water heaters will help to achieve this goal. The thermal performance of the flat-plate type solar energy water heater has been studied globally. In order to ensure the efficient operation of the solar water heater and user's demand to the terminal temperature of a tank, the countries all over the world with different climate have given different recommended value for water-mass-to-collector-area ratio (the ratio is abbreviated as MAR) of the flat-plate solar water heater. However, China has a vast territory and its climate is complex. The value range of recommended value from literatures is too large to be used to practical application. The main residential buildings in large and medium-sized cities are mostly high-rise buildings. The solar water heater installed on roof can only meet hot water use for the top six to eight floors. The application of the balcony wall-mounted solar water heater is one of the effective ways to solve hot water needs for the rest of users in high-rise buildings. Based on the typical meteorological data of nine cities in mild region of China, the values of MAR of the balcony wall-mounted flat-plate solar water heater have been calculated by using the established mathematical model. The water tank terminal temperature of 60, the collector angle of 60°-90° and the azimuth angle of 0-90° were used in model analysis. Calculation results for south-facing balcony wall-mounted solar water heater in mild region showed that the appropriate MAR of spring, summer, autumn, winter and the whole year was 28-51, 21-41, 31-53, 37-57 and 31-47 kg/m2, respectively. For convenience of practical application, the linear regression relation between seasonal and annual average MAR and the tilt angle for south-facing balcony wall-mounted solar water heater. The correlation coefficients between them were greater than 0.99. In this paper, we introduced a new concept 'azimuth factor of MAR' which was easy to calculate MAR for the collector with different azimuth angle. For the non-south-facing balcony wall-mounted solar water heater, the seasonal and annual average azimuth factors of MAR decreased with the increase of the azimuth angle. The seasonal and annual average azimuth factors of MAR ranged from 0.57 to 1.00 and 0.72 to 1.00 when the tilt angle and azimuth angle were respectively at 60°-90° and 10°-90°. The azimuth angle had about 5% effect on MAR for winter and spring, summer, autumn and the whole year when the azimuth angle was less than or equal to 20° and 30°. The azimuth angle had about 10% effect on the above-mentioned MAR when the azimuth angle was less than or equal to 30° and 40°. In conclusion, the annual average solar fraction ranges should be in 0.55-0.70 for the south-facing balcony wall-mounted flat-plate solar water heater used in mild region of China. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Appl Surf Sci,"PbS and CdS quantum dots (QDs) have been deposited onto TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) in turn via a sonication-assisted successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. This method could uniformly decorate TNTAs with QDs, avoiding QDs aggregation at the mouth of TiO2 nanotube. The loading amounts of QDs on TNTAs could be controlled by adjusting the TNTAs length. Under one sun illumination, the QDs co-sensitized TNTAs (TNTAs/QDs) with the length of about 2.4 μm displayed the highest photocurrent of 4.32 mA cm−2, which is 27 times higher than that of the bare TNTAs. Introduction of a thin ZnO energy barrier by atomic layer deposition (ALD) between the TNTAs and QDs can further improve the photocurrent of TNTAs/QDs. And the TNTAs/QDs with 10 ALD cycles of ZnO interlayer exhibits the highest photocurrent of 5.24 mA cm−2 and best photoconversion efficiency of 4.9%, a more than 20% enhancement over the bare TNTAs/QDs. Such enhanced photoelectrochemical performance may be ascribed to the increased amounts of QDs on the TNTAs due to the introduction of ZnO interlayer. The benefits of ALD layers play a crucial role in development and optimization of high-performance photoelectrodes in the near future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,20160101761153,,"Zeng, Min (1); Zeng, Xi (2); Peng, Xiange (1); Zhu, Zhuo (1); Liao, Jianjun (1); Liu, Kai (1); Wang, Guizhen (1); Lin, Shiwei (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Advanced Materials in Tropical Island Resources, College of Materials and Chemical Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China (2) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, 650500, China ",ASUSEE,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 813.1 Coating Techniques - 819.4 Fiber Products - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Atoms - Cadmium sulfide - Electrochemistry - Energy barriers - II-VI semiconductors - IV-VI semiconductors - Lead compounds - Nanocrystals - Nanotubes - Photocurrents - Semiconductor quantum dots - Titanium dioxide - Yarn - Zinc oxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lin, Shiwei(linsw@hainu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.12.169,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: ZDXM2014097, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Hainan University; Number: 51162007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51202050 , 51162007 , 51462008 ), the China Scholarship Council, the Key S&T Project of Hainan Province ( ZDXM2014097 ), Tianjin University-Hainan University Collaborative Innovation Fund Project, the training program of outstanding dissertation for graduates in Hainan University, and the innovation research project for graduates in universities of Hainan Province.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"This paper investigates the other-race-effects in automatic 3D facial expression recognition, giving the computational analysis of the recognition performance obtained from two races, namely white and east Asian. The 3D face information is represented by local depth feature, and then a feature learning process is used to obtain race-sensitive features to simulate the other-race-effect. The learned features from own race and other race are then used to do facial expression recognition. The proposed analysis is conducted on BU-3DFE database, and the results show that the learned features from one race achieve better recognition performance on the own-race faces. It reveals that the other-race-effect are significant in facial expression recognition problem, which confirms the results of psychological experiment results. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,20164402966947,,"Xue, Mingliang (1); Duan, Xiaodong (1); Zhou, Juxiang (2); Wang, Cunrui (1); Wang, Yuangang (1); Li, Zedong (1); Liu, Wanquan (3) ","(1) Dalian Key Lab of Digital Technology for National Culture, College of Computer Science and Engineering, Dalian Minzu University, Dalian; Liaoning; 116600, China (2) Key Laboratory of Education Informatization for Nationalities, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (3) Department of Computing, Curtin University, Kent Street, Perth; WA; 6102, Australia ",,461 Bioengineering and Biology,185299.0,"October 14, 2016 - October 16, 2016","Chengdu, China","11th Chinese Conference on Biometric Recognition, CCBR 2016",Biometrics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Duan, Xiaodong(duanxddlnu@126.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-46654-5_53,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: 2013405003, Acronym: USTL, Sponsor: University of Science and Technology Liaoning; Number: 2014FD016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61370146, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61262071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61370146), Liaoning Science & Technology of Liaoning Province of China (Grant No. 2013405003), Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61262071) and Application Infrastructure Projects in Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2014FD016).",9783319466538.0,03029743,,2016,English,Face recognition,"Biometric Recognition - 11th Chinese Conference, CCBR 2016, Proceedings",24.0,483-493,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence; Institute of Automation of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Sichuan University; Springer; Wisesoft Co., Ltd",A computational other-race-effect analysis for 3D facial expression recognition,,3-D facial expression recognition - 3-d facial expressions - Computational analysis - Facial expression recognition - Feature learning - Other-race effects - Psychological experiment - Sensitive features,9967 LNCS
Plant J.,"Seed dormancy and germination are important physiological processes during the life cycle of a seed plant. Recently, auxin has been characterized as a positive regulator that functions during seed dormancy and as a negative regulator during germination. Through chemical genetic screenings, we have identified a small molecule, germostatin (GS), which effectively inhibits seed germination in Arabidopsis. GSR1 (germostatin resistance locus 1) encodes a tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) finger protein, identified by screening GS-resistant mutants. Certain PHD fingers of GSR1 are capable of binding unmethylated H3K4, which has been reported as an epigenetic mark of gene transcriptional repression. Biochemical studies show that GSR1 physically interacts with the transcriptional repressor ARF16 and attenuates the intensity of interaction of IAA17/ARF16 by directly interacting with IAA17 to release ARF16. Further results show that axr3-1, arf10 arf16 are hyposensitive to GS, and gsr1 not only resists auxin-mediated inhibition of seed germination but also displays decreased dormancy. We therefore propose that GSR1 may form a co-repressor with ARF16 to regulate seed germination. Besides promoting auxin biosynthesis via upregulating expression of YUCCA1, GS also enhances auxin responses by inducing degradation of DΙΙ-VENUS and upregulating expression of DR5-GFP. In summary, we identified GSR1 as a member of the auxin-mediated seed germination genetic network, and GS, a small non-auxin molecule that specifically acts on auxin-mediated seed germination. © 2015 The Authors The Plant Journal.",Open Access,20160501877413,,"Ye, Yajin (1); Gong, Ziying (1); Lu, Xiao (1); Miao, Deyan (1); Shi, Jianmin (1); Lu, Juan (1); Zhao, Yang (1, 2) ","(1) Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai; 200032, China (2) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, 68 Wenchang Road, Yunnan; 650000, China ",PLJUED,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Biochemistry - Cultivation - Encoding (symbols) - Life cycle - Molecules - Plants (botany) - Proteins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Yang(yangzhaotoronto@sina.com) ",10.1111/tpj.13086,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1365313X,,,,09607412,1.0,"January 1, 2016",English,Seed,,63.0,3-15,,2016,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Plant Journal,,Germostatin resistance locus 1 encodes a PHD finger protein involved in auxin-mediated seed dormancy and germination,,Arabidopsis thaliana - auxin - Chemical genetics - PHD finger - Seed germination - Small molecules,85

Sep. Sci. Technol.,"The synergistic effects between sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) and a mixed fatty acids collector for apatite flotation were investigated. SDS benefitted the apatite flotation at pH 9.5. The TOC measurements showed that the addition of SDS improved the surfactants adsorption at the apatite surface. The colloidal size measurements suggested that the utilizing of SDS prevented the over-packing of fatty acids in the solution. Additionally, SDS did not adsorb/co-adsorb at the apatite surface as revealed by the FTIR and XPS results, because of the strong electrostatic repulsion between the apatite surface and the SDS ions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,20162602540215,,"Cao, Qinbo (1, 2); Cheng, Jinhua (2); Wen, Shuming (1, 2); Li, Chengxiu (3); Liu, Jianxiang (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming; Yunnan, China (2) Faculty of Land Resources Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan, China (3) Institute of Mineral Resource Comprehensive Utilization, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Chengdu, China ",SSTEDS,482.2 Minerals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Adsorption - Apatite - Flotation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wen, Shuming(shmwen@126.com) ",10.1080/01496395.2016.1147467,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205754,"Number: 20135314120007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51304089, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: KKSY201221120, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; ","Financial support was provided by the Yunnan Province program KKSY201221120 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China 20135314120007.

Meanwhile, ontology also returns the results to the user. Ontology mapping is used to connect the relationship between different ontologies, and similarity computation is the essence of such applications. In this article, we present a ranking based ontology optimizing algorithm to get the ontology score function which map each ontology vertex to a real number, and the similarity between ontology vertices is determined according to the difference of the scores. The ontology framework is designed relied on the eigenpair computation, and the solution is obtained by means of operator calculation.

Jisuanji Fuzhu Sheji Yu Tuxingxue Xuebao,"Image blending is an essential step in image stitching, and is often used to generate seamless blending images. However, current multi-band blending methods are much slower in processing high-resolution images. This paper presents a fast implementation of multiband blending for combining a set of registered images into a composite mosaic with no visible seams. Firstly, a unique seam image is computed using two-pass nearest distance transform, which is independent on the order of input images and has good scalability. Each individual mask can be extracted from this seam image quickly. Secondly, the seam image and masks are compressed using run-length encoding, and all the following mask operations are built on run-length encoding scheme. Thirdly, single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction set is used within Laplacian pyramids construction. Finally, the seamless blending image is generated from Laplacian pyramid collapsing. Two challenging data sets are evaluated in experiment and the proposed method can composite high quality blending images efficiently. Compared with existing image blending methods, the use of run-length encoding for masks processing leads to reduced memory requirements and a compact storage of the mask data, and the use of SIMD instruction set achieves better parallelism and faster execution speed on multi-core architectures. © 2016, Institute of Computing Technology.

Cybern., IHMSC","A binarization method for image enhancement of the palm leaf manuscripts is proposed, which can effectively perform the image binarization as well as remove superfluous lines on the images of palm leaf manuscripts. Firstly, an improved background elimination method is presented to solve the problem caused by different background color in a palm leaf. Then the classical Niblack's method is used to binarize image. But there are many noises on the result images obtained by the Niblack's method, so a morphology based method is applied to remove noise. Finally, a connected domain based method is described to delete superfluous lines.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Comput. Commun., ICCC - Proc.","Ontology learning has become a popular research field recently. But most ontology construction methods are semiautomatic, and the construction process of ontology is still a tedious and painstaking task. The cognitive model of ontology learning is an automatic model of ontology construction that simulates the process of human being recognizing the world. Induction is an important step of the model. This paper presents a strategy for the ontology induction in the cognitive model of ontology learning, which includes some generalization principles and the corresponding induction operators. It generates induction hypothesis through a series of operations.

The outage performance optimization problem of cognitive relay networks is resolved by designing the sensing time and fusion rule threshold appropriately. The outage probability by high signal to noise ratio (SNR) approximation under Rayleigh fading channels is derived theoretically, and the solution of optimal fusion rule threshold is given. Theoretical analysis and simulation results illustrate that the optimal sensing time and fusion rule threshold exist to minimize the outage probability.

Acoust. Phys.,"The transfer matrix method was used to analyze the acoustical properties of stepped acoustic resonator in the previous paper. The present paper extends the application of the transfer matrix method to analyzing acoustic resonators with gradually varying cross-sectional area. The transfer matrices and the resonant conditions are derived for acoustic resonators with four different kinds of gradually varying geometric shape: tapered, trigonometric, exponential and hyperbolic. Based on the derived transfer matrices, the acoustic properties of these resonators are derived, including the resonant frequency, phase and radiation impedance. Compared with other analytical methods based on the wave equation and boundary conditions, the transfer matrix method is simple to implement and convenient for computation. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,20164603025601,,"Min, Qi (1); He, Wan-Quan (1); Wang, Quan-Biao (1); Tian, Jia-Jin (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Honghe University, Mengzi, Yunnan; 661100, China ",,751.2 Acoustic Properties of Materials - 752.1 Acoustic Devices - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Acoustic impedance - Acoustic resonators - Natural frequencies,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Min, Qi(minq7@163.com) ",10.1134/S1063771016060117,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10637710,6,"November 1, 2016",English,Transfer matrix method,,10.0,672-680,,2016,Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing,Acoustical Physics,,An extension of the transfer matrix method to analyzing acoustic resonators with gradually varying cross-sectional area,,Acoustical properties - Analytical method - Cross sectional area - Geometric shape - Radiation impedance - Resonant condition - Transfer matrixes,62
Chin. Phys.,"In order to deepen the understanding of the relationship between fundamental properties (including: microstructure and composition) and photocatalytic performance, four bismuthate compounds, including: LiBiO3, NaBiO3, KBiO3, and AgBiO3, are regarded as research examples in the present work, because they have particular crystal structures and similar compositions. Using density functional theory calculations, their structural, electronic, and optical properties are investigated and compared systematically. First of all, the calculated results of crystal structures and optical properties are in agreement with available published experimental data. Based on the calculated results, it is found that the tunneled or layered micro-structural properties lead to the stronger interaction between bismuth and oxygen, and the weaker interaction between alkaline-earth metal and [BiO6] octahedron, resulting in the feature of multi-band gaps in the cases of LiBiO3, NaBiO3, and KBiO3. This conclusion is supported by the case of AgBiO3, in which the feature of multi-band gaps disappears, due to the stronger interaction between the noble metal and [BiO6] octahedron. These properties have significant advantages in the photocatalytic performance: absorbing low energy photons, rapidly transferring energy carriers. Furthermore, the features of electronic structures of bismuthate compounds are well reflected by the absorption spectra, which could be confirmed by experimental measurements in practice. Combined with the calculated results, it could be considered that the crystal structures and compositions of the photocatalyst determine the electronic structures and optical properties, and subsequently determine the corresponding photocatalytic performance. Thus, a novel Bi-based photocatalyst driven by visible-light could be designed by utilizing specific compositions to form favorable electronic structures or specific micro-structures to form a beneficial channel for energy carriers. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",,20161202134002,37102.0,"Zhou, Wen-Liu (1); Zhao, Zong-Yan (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",,408 Structural Design - 547.1 Precious Metals - 741.1 Light/Optics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Bismuth compounds - Crystal microstructure - Density functional theory - Electronic structure - Energy gap - Light - Optical properties - Precious metals,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Zong-Yan(zzy@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1088/1674-1056/25/3/037102,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20583834,,,,16741056,3,"January 18, 2016",English,Structural properties,,27.0,,,2016,Institute of Physics Publishing,Chinese Physics B,,"Electronic structures of efficient MBiO3(M = Li, Na, K, Ag) photocatalyst",,Bi-based - Energy carriers - Fundamental properties - Low energy photons - Micro-structural properties - Multi band - Photocatalytic performance - Visible light,25
BioResour.,"Cross-linked cellulose microspheres (CL-CMs) were successfully prepared using an inverse crosslinking suspension method from a cellulose solution with sodium hydroxide/urea aqueous solution as a solvent and epichlorohydrin as the crosslinker. The effects of epichlorohydrin content on the appearance and dispersity, average pore volume, moisture content, and wet real density of CL-CMs were studied. The microspheres presented a good spherical shape and porous surface structure. After activation with NaIO4, the recombinant protein A was immobilized onto the surface of CL-CMs to form an immunoadsorbent. Adsorbents containing various amounts of protein A were applied to adsorb immunoglobulin G (IgG) from human plasma. The maximum IgG adsorption capacities with static adsorption and dynamic adsorption were 23 and 13 mg, respectively, per gram of CL-CMs carrying 6.8 mg of recombinant protein A.

Adv. Optoelectron.,"A simple iterative optimization method is developed to improve the exiting light uniformity of the edge-lit backlight module. The method uses the relative deviation of the average luminous flux of the entire light guide plate (LGP) and the luminous flux of each region as constraint criterion and the ratio of the luminous flux of each region to the average luminous flux of the LGP as adjustment coefficient to adjust the density of the microstructures in each region. This process loops until the relative deviations of all regions meet a prespecified threshold value. A LGP based on microprism structure is presented to validate the method. The initial values, which represent the size of the microstructures manufactured on the bottom surfaces of the LGP, d 0 -dependent luminous fluxes, microstructure size distributions, iterations of the LGP, and the relative deviation of each region are discussed. The simulation results show that it is a very practical method for the uniformity improvement of the backlight when an appropriate initial value is selected and the final uniformity is better than 90% after optimization. © 2016 Jin-Ren Yan et al.",Open Access,20164202925455,1760260.0,"Yan, Jin-Ren (1); Li, De-Cong (1); Wang, Zhi-Kun (1); Rao, Wen-Ping (1) ","(1) Department of Optoelectronic Engineering, Yunnan Open University, Xuefu Road 113, Kunming; 650223, China ",,921.6 Numerical Methods - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Microstructure,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yan, Jin-Ren(renyj0720@163.com) ",10.1155/2016/1760260,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),16875648,,,,1687563X,,2016,English,Iterative methods,,12.0,,,2016,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Advances in OptoElectronics,,An Iterative Method for the Uniformity Improvement of Edge-Lit Backlight,,Adjustment coefficient - Backlight module - Exiting-light uniformity - Iterative Optimization - Light guide plate - Micro-prism structure - Practical method - Relative deviations,2016
Anal. Methods,"In this work, a simple method for detecting ammonium persulfate using silver triangular nanoparticles (silver TNPs) was developed. Specifically, silver TNPs exhibited strong/appreciable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signals at 670 nm, and low concentrations of ammonium persulfate could induce a decrease in the SPR of the silver TNPs and a change in their appearance from blue to colorless. Furthermore, it was also found that the SPR intensity was inversely proportional to the concentration of ammonium persulfate over the range of 0.10-0.70 mmol L-1, with a correlation coefficient of -0.9994. Recoveries for ammonium persulfate in spiked samples were in the range of 94.4-105.8%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 3.3-5.6%.

Chem. Eur. J.,"A series of green butterfly-shaped thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, namely PXZPM, PXZMePM, and PXZPhPM, are developed by integrating an electron-donor (D) phenoxazine unit and electron-acceptor (A) 2-substituted pyrimidine moiety into one molecule via a phenyl-bridge π linkage to form a D–π–A–π–D configuration. Changing the substituent at pyrimidine unit in these emitters can finely tune their emissive characteristics, thermal properties, and energy gaps between the singlet and triplet states while maintaining frontier molecular orbital levels, and thereby optimizing their optoelectronic properties. Employing these TADF emitters results in a green fluorescent organic light-emitting diode (OLED) that exhibits a peak forward-viewing external quantum efficiency (EQE) close to 25 % and a slow efficiency roll-off characteristic at high luminance. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Rock Soil Mech,"In order to accurately and conveniently determine the mechanical behavior of hard rock in deep engineering structures, the following works have been conducted in this paper: according to the similar mechanism of damage and plastic, determination scheme of initial yield is assumed to be used for the damage threshold. Unified energy yield criterion of rock is adopted as the decision criterion of damage threshold. Based on the definition of damage variable by Rabotnov and hypothesis of Lemaitre strain equivalence, a simplified damage constitutive law is formulated by assuming the stress- strain relation of undamaged portion to conform Hooke's law. Aimed at expressing brittle-ductile transition of hard rock under the condition from low confining pressure to high confining pressure, a modified Mazars damage evolution equation is proposed. Damage model parameters are determined based on conventional triaxial compressive test of T2bmarble. The proposed model is contrasted with the model based on Mazars damage evolution and damage threshold criterion used by Mohr-Coulomb criterion respectively. It is suggested that the damage model can express brittle-ductile transition and simulate damage evolution after damage threshold in an accurate way, which has some reference for engineering calculation of brittle hard rock. © 2016, Academia Sinica.

Ind Manage Data Sys,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on the value creation potential of cloud computing in inter-firm partnerships. It examines how cloud-based IT infrastructure capabilities in flexibility and integration contribute to partnering agility and, consequently, firm performance. This study also introduces business lifecycle and market turbulence as internal and external context variables, respectively, to investigate the different roles of cloud computing in value creation. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was used to collect data from 184 client firms of the largest cloud computing services provider in China (Alibaba Cloud). The theoretical model was tested using PLS analysis. Findings - Cloud infrastructure (CI) flexibility has a positive effect on partnering agility, while the effect of CI integration on partnering agility is moderated by business lifecycle and market turbulence. Research limitations/implications - The surveyed firms are all Alibaba Cloud clients, which may limit the generalization of the findings. Practical implications - The study suggests that besides the cost benefits, the value creation aspect of cloud computing should also be emphasized in research and practice. The study provides a new perspective to understand the business value of cloud computing in inter-firm partnerships. Originality/value - The study suggests that the flexibility-related and integration-related features of cloud computing can create value for firms by facilitating inter-firm collaboration in exploiting business opportunities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,20162702566190,,"Liu, Sen (1); Yang, Yang (2); Qu, Wen Guang (2); Liu, Yuan (2) ","(1) School of Logistics, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming, China (2) School of Management, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China ",IMDSD8,722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 921.2 Calculus,,,,,Commerce - Integration - Life cycle - Surveys - Turbulence,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Qu, Wen Guang(quwg@zju.edu.cn) ",10.1108/IMDS-09-2015-0376,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,02635577,6,"July 11, 2016",English,Cloud computing,,38.0,1160-1177,,2016,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd., Howard House, Wagon Lane, Bingley, BD16 1WA, United Kingdom",Industrial Management and Data Systems,,The business value of cloud computing: The partnering agility perspective,,Business opportunities - Cloud computing services - Cloud infrastructures - Design/methodology/approach - Inter-firm collaboration - IT infrastructures - Partnering agility - Theoretical modeling,116
"IEEE Int. Power Modul. High Volt. Conf., IPMHVC","Very fast transient overvoltages (VFTOs) generated during the routine operations of disconnector switch in GIS make great threat to the insulation of power equipment such as GIS. So far, the research results of the insulation characteristics of GIS under VFTO have big dispersion and poor comparability for the waveform parameters of VFTO have not been standardized. A generating system of double-exponential impulses with front times in the range of 0.08∼1.2 μs and wave tail times in the range of 1.5∼50 μs was established to simulate VFTO. Using this impulse generator, the influence of impulse wave front time and wave tail time on the breakdown voltage in SF6highly inhomogeneous electric field was studied. The results show that with the rise of gas pressure, the hump phenomenon occurs in the U50%-P curves. With the increase of impulse wave front time, the 50% breakdown voltages change significantly and the U50%-rf curves tend to be U-shaped. The bigger the electric field factor f is, the more obvious the U-shaped trend is. Meanwhile, the 50% breakdown voltages decrease significantly with the increase of impulse wave tail time. Analysis reveals that the reasons for the phenomenon above may be explained by the differences of the migration and diffusion of space charges and discharge time delay under impulses with different waveform parameters. © 2016 IEEE.",,20173804175017,8012836.0,"Wen, Tao (1); Zhang, Qiaogen (1); Wu, Zhicheng (1); Guo, Can (1); Chen, Ming (1); Zhang, Lingli (1); Tan, Xiangyu (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China (2) Yunnan Electric Power Test and Research Institute Group CO.

IAENG Int. J. Appl. Math.,"Smoothing properties of the collective relaxations in multigrid method for solving 2D Stokes flow on the non-staggered grid are investigated by means of local Fourier analysis (LFA). For multigrid relaxation, the non-staggered discretizing scheme of Stokes flow is generally stabilized by adding an artificial pressure term. Therefore, an important problem is how to determine the zone of parameter of this term. To do that, a collective red-black Jacobi point (CRB-JACP) relaxation for the 2D Stokes flow is established. Firstly, the h-ellipticity for the 2D Stokes system is obtained with the parameter of the artificial pressure term. Then the Fourier representation of CRB-JACP relaxation for discretizing Stokes flow is given by the form of square matrix, whose eigenvalues are being computed. And a mathematical relation of the smoothing factor between the artificial pressure term and the h-ellipticity is well yielded. The results show that the numerical schemes for solving 2D Stokes flow by multigrid method on CRB-JACP have a specific convergence zone of parameter of added artificial pressure term.",,20164903086186,,"Zhu, Xingwen (1, 2); Zhang, Lixiang (3) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Computer, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan; 671003, China (2) Department of Engineering Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, 650500, China (3) Department of Engineering Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",,921 Mathematics,,,,,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions - Fourier analysis - Fourier transforms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Lixiang(zlxzcc@126.com) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19929986,"Number: 20135314130002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51279071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant no. 51279071] and the Doctoral Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [Grant no. 20135314130002],,19929978,4,2016,English,Convergence of numerical methods,,24.0,550-558,,2016,International Association of Engineers,IAENG International Journal of Applied Mathematics,,Smoothing analysis of collective relaxation for solving 2D stokes flow by multigrid method,,Collective relaxation - H-ellipticity - Multigrid methods - Smoothing factors - Stokes flows,46
Gaodeng Xuexiao Huaxue Xuebao,"Using vancomycin and 1,6-diisocyanatohexane as the monomers, an enantioselective composite membrane was prepared by interfacial polymerization on a polysulfone support and was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The composite membrane was used for enantioseparation of D,L-phenylglycine which is an indispensable reagent in the syntheses of penicillins and cephalosporins. By optimizing the molar ratio of vancomycin and 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, the time of polymerization and the feed concentration of the racemate, an enantiomeric excess[e.e.(%)] of over 70% D-phenylglycine could be obtained. Comparing the membrane adsorption, solid extraction, membrane chromatography, dialysis and ultrafiltration of vancomycin optical resolution membrane, the L-phenylglycine was prior adsorbed, while, the D-phenylglycine was first permeated the membrane. Based on the association characteristic of racemate of D,L-phenylglycine, we suggested, in the first time, that the enantioseparation mechanism of membrane was “adsorption-association-diffusion”. © 2016, Higher Education Press.

Guangzi Xuebao,"A Long Wavelength Infrared(LWIR) wide-angle lens whose Field Of View(FOV) is 110° was proposed. The operating wavelength of the lens is a range from 8 to 12 μm, the operating temperature range is -40~60, the effective focal length is 5mm, and the F number is 2. This design utilizes a combination of 6 lens elements that are made of chalcogenide glass materials, Zinc Sulfide, and Zinc Selenide. The optical powers of the lens elements as well as their locations were carefully calculated and optimized to simultaneously eliminate the chromatic and thermal aberrations for the designed wavelength/temperature range. Taking advantage of the superior molding capability of chalcogenide glasses, the proposed design incorporates three aspherical surfaces on lens elements fabricated with chalcogenide glasses, such that optical aberrations can be furtherly corrected. According to the design results, the proposed system can produce thermal images with a close to diffraction limited performance for the temperature range from -40 to 60.

Electrochim Acta,"A novel tri-modal mesoporous carbon (TMC)/S composite as a high performance cathode for Li-S battery is reported. The TMC host, synthesized by a simple sol-gel templating method, possesses one of the highest surface area of 2371 m2g-1, pore volume of 2.85 cc g-1and a unique tri-modal mesopore structure (2.5 nm/9 nm/15 nm). Electrochemical tests reveal that the TMC/S-50 wt% nanocomposite cathode delivers an initial capacity up to 1029 mAh g-1at 3350 mA g-1(2C), and maintains a high reversible capacity of 843 mAh g-1after 100 cycles. And it retains a stable capacity of 708 mAh g-1after 100 cycles at 5025 mA g-1(charge/discharge in 20 min, 3C). Even with a higher sulfur loading, the TMC/S-70 wt% nanocomposite still reaches a reversible capacity of 700 mAh g-1, and demonstrates a very low decay rate of only 0.088% per cycle over 300 cycles at 838 mA g-1(0.5C). We attribute such superior performance to the collective effect of tri-modal mesopore architecture, especially to the contribution of the exterior large mesopores (15 nm), designed being not only large enough to accommodate rapid electrolyte transport, moreover, small enough to serve as additional buffer spaces for polysulfides entrapment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

RSC Adv.,"Glycans that attached to glycoproteins on cell surfaces are known to be functionally important and they have potential diagnostic values. The development of effective methods to analyze glycan expression on living cell surface is desirable for understanding their functions in disease progression and providing a powerful tool for early diagnosis. In this paper, thionine-bridged multiwalled carbon nanotube/gold nanoparticle (MWCNT/Th/AuNP) as a mediator/nanomaterial composite was synthesized to develop an electrochemical biosensor for glycan assay on living cancer cells. The MWCNT/Th/AuNP composite was fabricated by binding AuNPs to the surface of Th-coated MWCNTs, in which thionine acted as a linker to enable the negatively charged AuNPs to bind to the anionic MWCNT surface. When compared with conventional nanomaterial-based electrochemical biosensors, the MWCNT/Th/AuNP-modified electrode contained thionine as an electron mediator and simplified the electrochemical process based on enzymatic catalysis for signal amplification. Under a sandwich-type assay format, the MWCNT/Th/AuNP-based biosensor facilitated highly sensitive and specific detection of mannose on human liver and prostate cancer cells and offered great promise for the analysis of other glycans on living cells by utilizing a greater variety of lectins. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20165003122320,,"Zhang, Xinai (1); Huang, Chenyong (1); Jiang, Yuxiang (1); Shen, Jianzhong (1); Geng, Ping (2); Zhang, Wen (2); Huang, Qilin (3) ","(1) School of Food and Biological Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang; Jiangsu; 212013, China (2) Department of Chemistry, East China Normal University, Shanghai; 200062, China (3) Chemical Department, YuXi Normal University, Yuxi; Yunnan; 653100, China ",RSCACL,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 819.4 Fiber Products - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Bioassay - Biosensors - Cell membranes - Diagnosis - Diseases - Dyes - Electrochemical electrodes - Nanoparticles - Polysaccharides - Synthesis (chemical) - Yarn,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Xinai(zhangxinai@mail.ujs.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c6ra23710j,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,"Number: 1033000006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21205051, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21375040, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015Y358, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2013Z073, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21205051, 21375040), Key projects of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education (2013Z073), General project of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education (2015Y358), and Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (1033000006).",,,114,2016,English,Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN),,33.0,112981-112987,,2016,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,An electrochemical glycan biosensor based on a thionine-bridged multiwalled carbon nanotube/gold nanoparticle composite-modified electrode,,Composite modified electrodes - Disease progression - Electrochemical biosensor - Electrochemical process - Enzymatic catalysis - Negatively charged - Prostate cancer cells - Signal amplifications,6
Sep. Purif. Technol.,"In this study, seven flavonoids were successfully separated from Spirodela polyrrhiza (L.) Schleid. via high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) with elution-extrusion and online recycling elution modes. The first step for successful HSCCC separation is the crucial solvent system selection. In this work, nonrandom two-liquid segment activity coefficient (NRTL-SAC) method, a computational strategy, was used to facilitate the solvent system selection process. According to the NRTL-SAC method, a suitable solvent system can be rapidly predicted and screened by calculating the partition coefficient rather than by performing tedious experimental measurements. Based on the method, two solvent systems of hexane/ethyl acetate/ethanol/water (1:3:1:3 and 1:9:1:9, v/v) were predicted as the most suitable systems for HSCCC separation. To avoid unnecessary waste of the stationary or mobile phase, both the mobile and stationary phases were prepared independently based on the calculated phase compositions by thermodynamic method. Consequently, seven compounds were successfully separated with high purity (>90%). The separated compounds were identified through UV spectra and high-resolution tandem mass spectroscopy. These compounds include orientin (1), vitexin (2), luteolin 7-O-glucoside (3), apigenin 7-O-glucoside (4), luteolin 8-C-(2″-O-feruloyl-) glucoside (5), apigenin 8-C-(-2″-O-feruloyl-) glucoside (6), and luteolin (7).

Shuikexue Jinzhan,"Under the global change, water crisis was identified as the most critical issue of the world crisis in the coming 10 years. The topics of most concern in the water crisis are the transboundary water dispute and its geo-cooperative competition in international rivers. Many scientific and technical problems need to be solved for transboundary water security and benefit sharing. In this paper, the research progress of water security and water benefit in international rivers were reviewed, and their problems and challenges identified. Focusing on the establishment of theories and methods for transboudary water benefit sharing adapting to the global change, the key scientific and technical problems, and the innovative approaches were proposed; the major objectives and contents, and the general scheme and technical routes for multi-discipline researches, have been set. These researches will facilitate the development of water science of international rivers, and strengthen the capacity building to governance the transboundary water risks under the global change. © 2016, Editorial Board of Advances in Water Science.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"In many real-world situations, there exist two or more associated products, such as beer and nappy, mobile phone and mobile power pack, bed and mattress etc., in which consumers are likely to purchase these two or more associated products simultaneously. Thus, the associated products can be promoted at the same time, which implies cooperative influence spread of products in viral marketing. In this paper, we focus on maximizing the cooperative influence spread of associated products in a social network. First, we make use of a similarity model, abbreviated as SM, to generate the probabilities of edges. Then, we obtain the cooperative influence spread graph based on single influence spread graphs of these two products and the associated rule. Further, we propose independent cascade model with accepted probability (ICMAP) to describe the cooperative influence spread in a social network, and give an improved greedy algorithm to maximize the cooperative influence spread approximately. Experimental results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20164502976850,,"Wu, Hong (1, 2); Zhang, Zhijian (1, 3); Yue, Kun (1); Zhang, Binbin (1); Liu, Weiyi (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) School of Information Engineering, Qujing Normal University, Qujing, China (3) College of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 822.3 Food Products - 911.4 Marketing",184979.0,"September 23, 2016 - September 25, 2016","Suzhou, China","18th International Conference on Web Technologies and Applications, APWeb 2016 and Workshop on 2nd International Workshop on Web Data Mining and Applications, WDMA 2016 and 1st International Workshop on Graph Analytics and Query Processing, GAP 2016 and 1st International Workshop on Spatial-temporal Data Management and Analytics, SDMA 2016",Beer - Commerce - Data mining - Graphic methods - Information management - Marketing - Space division multiple access,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yue, Kun(kyue@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-45835-9_1,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: XT412011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: 2013FB010, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FA023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014C134Y, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: XT412003, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 61232002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61402398, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472345, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61472345, 61402398, 61232002), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2014FA023, 2013FB010), Program for Innovative Research Team in Yunnan University (No. XT412011), Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University (No. XT412003), and the Research Foundation of the Educational Department of Yunnan Province (No. 2014C134Y).",9783319458342.0,03029743,,2016,English,Social networking (online),"Web Technologies and Applications - APWeb 2016 Workshops, WDMA, GAP, and SDMA, Proceedings",16.0,3-15,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Maximizing the cooperative influence spread in a social network oriented to viral marketing,,CASCADE model - Cooperative influence spread - Greedy algorithms - Network oriented - Real world situations - Similarity models - Submodularity - Viral marketing,9865 LNCS
Appl Phys Lett,"Organo-metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a highly promising class of semiconductors for optoelectronic device applications. Integrating these hybrid materials within organic molecular thin film devices is key to fabricate functional devices. By evaporating ultra-thin films of organic semiconductor on thermally evaporated CH3NH3PbI3and using in-situ ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, we directly measure the interfacial energy offset between CH3NH3PbI3valence band maximum and the highest occupied molecular orbital for 5 different archetypal organic semiconductors. It is found that the energy offsets scale linearly as a function of the ionization energies of the organic semiconductors.

J. Mater. Chem. A,"Future solar cells are expected to generate electricity under all weather conditions. To address this profound issue, we take the first step to produce solar cells that can generate electricity under both rainy and sunny conditions. In the current study, a bifunctional solar cell realizing photoelectric conversion under solar irradiation along with the electric signals by dropping raindrops was produced by integrating a monolayer graphene with a solar cell, yielding a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 7.69% under AM1.5 irradiation as well as a current of 0.66 μA per raindrop and a voltage of 61.8 μV per raindrop by simulated raindrops. Owing to the optical loss across the monolayer graphene, the solar cell architecture was optimized, yielding a solar cell efficiency of 9.14% as well as a current of a few microamps per raindrop and a voltage of tens of microvolts per raindrop. Moreover, the newly launched solar cell has good stability under the persistent dropping of simulated rain. The current work can also extend our knowledge of advanced all-weather solar cells.

Int. J. Remote Sens.,"Topographic correction is a crucial and challenging step in interpreting optical remote-sensing images of extremely complex terrain environments due to the lack of universally suitable correction algorithms and digital elevation models (DEMs) of adequate resolution and quality. The free availability of open source global DEMs provides an unprecedented opportunity to remove topographic effects associated with remote-sensing data in remote and rugged mountain terrains. This study evaluated the performances of seven topographic correction methods including C-correction (C), Cosine C-correction (CC), Minnaert correction (M), Sun–canopy–sensor (SCS) correction (S), SCS+C-correction (SC), Teillet regression correction (TR), and the Terrain illumination correction model (TI) based on multi-source DEMs (local topographic map, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM filled-finished A/B and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) global digital elevation model (GDEM) data sets) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data using visual and statistical evaluation strategies. Overall, these investigated topographic correction methods removed topographic effects associated with Landsat-8 OLI data to varying degrees. However, the performances of these methods generally depend on the use of different DEMs and evaluation strategies. Among these correction methods, the SCS+C-correction performed best and was less sensitive to the use of different DEMs. The performances of topographic corrections based on free and open-access DEMs were generally better than or comparable to those based on local topographic maps. In particular, the topographic correction performance was greatly improved using the SRTM filled-finished B (FFB) data set with a resampling scheme based on the average value within a 3 × 3 pixel window. Nevertheless, further quantitative investigation is needed to determine the relative importance of DEMs and evaluation strategies used to select topographic correction methods. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,20164202901801,,"Wu, Qiong (1, 2); Jin, Yuan (1, 2); Fan, Hui (1, 2) ","(1) Asian International Rivers Center of Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Yunnan key laboratory of international rivers and transboundary eco-security, Kunming, China ",IJSEDK,405.3 Surveying - 481.1 Geology - 481.1.1 Geomorphology - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment,,,,,Digital instruments - Forestry - Landforms - Maps - Radar reflection - Remote sensing - Surveying - Tracking radar,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fan, Hui(Fanhui@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1080/01431161.2016.1222101,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),13665901,"Number: 2013BAB06B03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: HNKJ13-H17-03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014HB005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 41461017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41461017], the National Science and Technology Support Program of China [grant number 2013BAB06B03], China Huaneng Group Science & Technology Program [grant number HNKJ13-H17-03], Candidates of the Young and Middle Aged Academic Leaders of Yunnan Province [grant number 2014HB005], and Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University.",,01431161,19,"October 1, 2016",English,Geomorphology,,51.0,4712-4730,,2016,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,International Journal of Remote Sensing,,Evaluating and comparing performances of topographic correction methods based on multi-source DEMs and Landsat-8 OLI data,,Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer - Digital elevation model - Illumination correction - Operational land imager - Optical remote sensing - Quantitative investigation - Shuttle radar topography mission - Statistical evaluation,37
Int J Refrig,"The performance of solar cooling absorption system needs further research, due to its poor coefficient of performance (COP). Therefore, this study investigated the performance of a 23 kW solar powered single-effect lithium bromide–water (LiBr–H2O) absorption cooling system. Furthermore, the space heating mode was also investigated and the improvement methods were analyzed and discussed. The cooling system was driven by a parabolic trough collector of 56 m2aperture area and used for cooling a 102 m2meeting room. Research results revealed that the chiller's maximum instantaneous refrigeration coefficient (chiller efficiency) could be up to 0.6. Most of the time, in sunny and clear sky days the daily solar heat fraction ranged from 0.33 to 0.41 and the collectors field efficiency ranged from 0.35 to 0.45.

Sep. Purif. Technol.,"Slag refining is one of the most effective methods to remove impurities from metallurgical grade silicon. In this paper, ZnO was added to a binary 50% CaO-50% SiO2slag system with a mass ratio of 2–30% to study the impurities removal from metallurgical grade silicon. The results showed that boron was reduced from 12.94 ppmw to 2.18 ppmw by a 46% CaO-46% SiO2-8% ZnO slag system. Compared to the 50% CaO-50% SiO2slag system, slag refining with ZnO addition showed a 20% increase in removal efficiency and a 40% increase in the distribution coefficient. After acid leaching, boron was further reduced to 1.52 ppmw with a removal efficiency of 88.25%.

"IEEE CITS - Int. Conf. Comput., Inf. Telecommun. Syst.","Spatial co-locations represent the subsets of spatial features which are frequently located together in a geographic space. Spatial co-location mining has been a research hot in recent years. But the research on causal rule discovery hidden in spatial co-locations has not been reported. Maybe the features in a co-location accidentally share the similar environment, and maybe they are competitively living in the same environment, they themselves have no causal relationships. So mining causal rules in amount of prevalent co-locations is more interesting. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to mine causal rules from prevalent co-locations based on dynamic spatial databases. Because of large collections of prevalent co-locations and amount of rules in one co-location, the computational cost for the discovery is high, thus the pruning strategies are presented to solve the problem in an acceptable period of time. The extensive experiments evaluate the proposed algorithms with 'real + synthetic' data sets and the results show that causal rules are just about 60% of co-location rules, and which are more powerful.1 © 2016 IEEE.",,20163802815480,7546420.0,"Lu, Junli (1); Wang, Lizhen (1); Fang, Yuan (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.3 Database Systems,123384.0,"July 6, 2016 - July 8, 2016","Kunming, China","2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, CITS 2016",Data mining - Database systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Lizhen(lzhwang2005@126.com) ",10.1109/CITS.2016.7546420,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by grants (No. 61472346) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and in part by a grant (No. 2015FB149, No.2015FB114) from the Science Foundation of Yunnan Province.",9781509034406.0,,,"August 16, 2016",English,Location,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",15.0,,1of1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE CITS 2016 - 2016 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks (ISN); Xidian University; Yunnan Minzu University,Mining causal rules hidden in spatial co-locations based on dynamic spatial databases,,Causal relationships - causal rules - Co-locations - Computational costs - Dynamic spatial - Pruning strategy - Spatial data mining - Spatial features,
Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Spatial co-location mining has been used for discovering spatial feature sets which show frequent association relationships based on the spatial neighborhood. In spatial high utility co-location mining, we should consider the utility as a measure of interests, by considering the different value of individual instance that belongs to different feature. This paper presents a problem of updating high utility co-locations on evolving spatial databases which are updated with fresh data at some areas. Updating spatial patterns is a complicated process in that fresh data increase the new neighbor relationships. The increasing of neighbors can affect the result of high utility co-location mining. This paper proposes an algorithm for efficiently updating high utility co-locations and evaluates the algorithm by experiments. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,20162702570917,,"Wang, Xiaoxuan (1); Wang, Lizhen (1); Lu, Junli (1); Zhou, Lihua (1) ","(1) Department of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, No. 2 Cuihu North Road, Wuhua District, Kunming City; Yunnan Province, China ",,,176309.0,"June 3, 2016 - June 5, 2016","Nanchang, China","17th International Conference on Web-Age Information Management, WAIM 2016",Information management,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Lizhen(lzhwang2005@126.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-39937-9_6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2015FB114, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2015FB149, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by grants (No. 61472346, No. 61262069) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and in part by a grant (No. 2015FB149, No. 2015FB114) from the Science Foundation of Yunnan Province.",9783319399362.0,03029743,,2016,English,Location,"Web-Age Information Management - 17th International Conference, WAIM 2016, Proceedings",22.0,67-81,1 of 1,2016,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Effectively updating high utility co-location patterns in evolving spatial databases,,Co-location patterns - Co-locations - Incremental updates - Spatial database - Spatial features - Spatial neighborhoods - Spatial patterns - Utility mining,9658

This study explored Chinese visitors' satisfaction with a bamboo forestry attraction using the Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) approach (n = 373). Overall satisfaction with interpretive services at the Southern Sichuan Bamboo Sea was high, and that visitors' satisfaction varied depending on whether they took part in a guided or self-guided interpretive tour. Visitor satisfaction with different interpretive elements were located in different IPA grid quadrants, and indicated elements that required further improvement in order to meet visitors' desired levels of performance (e.g., guides' responsiveness to visitor inquiries, coordination of audio-visual equipment, and the ease of use of multimedia devices).

Ecol. Eng.,"The increased demand for economic benefits has led to an extensive conversion of native sandy steppe at the margins of oases into alfalfa forage land and farmland in northwestern China. Understanding the impacts of alfalfa forage land and farmland on soil properties is crucial for maintaining the stability of oases. However, the effect of this newly-reclaimed alfalfa forage land and farmland on soil properties remains unknown. Native sandy steppe and 10-year-old alfalfa forage land and farmland (both converted from native sandy steppe) were chosen for use in this study. It was shown that the conversion of native sandy steppe to alfalfa forage land and farmland significantly increased the amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Over the period of 10 years, the sequestrations of SOC, TN and TP were almost the same for both alfalfa forage land and farmland. After the period of 10 years, the soil water holding ability, water stable macro-aggregates aggregates, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN) contents and urease, β-glucosidase, and alkaline phosphatase activities were all significantly higher in the alfalfa forage land than in the farmland. These results suggest that the newly-reclaimed alfalfa forage land is more propitious for amending soil environments than farmland, thus it should be widely used to improve the soil properties at the margins of oases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20162402480703,,"Dong, Wei-Hua (1); Zhang, Sen (2); Rao, Xin (2); Liu, Chang-An (2) ","(1) College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Changchun Normal University, Changchun; 130032, China (2) Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla, Yunnan; 666303, China ",ECENEL,406 Highway Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control,,,,,Aggregates - Organic carbon - Phosphatases - Reclamation - Soil moisture,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Chang-An(liuchangan@xtbg.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.05.056,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 20130101109JC, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Education Department of Jilin Province; Number: 31470639, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We would like to thank the Linze Research Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences for providing research facilities and hospitality.

Solid State Commun,"In the present work, we have obtained a large zero-field cooled exchange-bias (spontaneous exchange bias, SEB) in Ni50Mn35Fe2In13Heusler alloy. The experimental results indicate that the sample with x=2 exhibits super-spin glass (SSG), super-paramagnetic (SPM), super-ferromagnetic (SFM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) behaviors in the martensite state at low temperature. Contributing to the complex magnetic interactions, a large SEB effect with the value of 1567 Oe was obtained at 5 K. At the same time, a non-monotonic behavior of spontaneous exchange bias field (spontaneous HEB) was observed with the variation of temperature, which is resulted from the competition between the volume fraction of SFM clusters and the exchange coupling of the SFM-AFM interface. In addition, during martensitic transformation (MT), extraordinary electrical transport properties of Ni50Mn37-xFexIn13(x=2-4) alloys have been observed under various external magnetic field. The maximal value of the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) reaches about 57% at 135 K under the external magnetic field change of 50 kOe.

Mater. Des.,"Porous NiTi possesses suitable mechanical characteristics for orthopaedic implants. However, its poor bioactivity is a major challenge in the clinical application. Composite structures of porous NiTi and hydroxyapatite (HA) can be used to promote the bone ingrowth and integration of the implant with the surrounding tissue. But the differences in physical and mechanical properties of these composites are the main problem during sintering. Hence, we report a rapid fabrication of porous NiTi-HA composites using spark plasma sintering (SPS) with space holder method. Effect of HA on pore characteristics, mechanical properties and in vitro bioactivity (corrosion behaviors, ion release and apatite formation ability) of the porous NiTi-HA was investigated. Results showed that interconnected pore characteristics and 29%-37% porosity could be achieved by adding HA from 3 to 10 wt.%. Compression test revealed that porous NiTi-HA possessed not only low elastic modulus of 5.6-8.1 GPa (close to that of human bone) but also high compressive strength. Furthermore, the addition of HA could improve the bioactivity of porous NiTi significantly. The bioactivity mechanism and a relationship of HA concentration in the NiTi matrix are also discussed. The combination of interconnected pore characteristics, low elastic modulus, high strength and good bioactivity might make this material a candidate for hard tissue implants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20161602250457,,"Zhang, L.

J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol.,"In this paper, a kind of label-free immunosensor for rapid detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) based on Pd-Ir bimetallic nanoparticles as a catalyst was prepared. CEA antibody (anti-CEA) was immobilized onto the surface of glassy carbon electrode through the adsorption effect of Pd-Ir bimetallic nanoparticles modified on the electrode using chitosan. When CEA antibody combines with CEA antigen, the formed immunocomplexs blocks the catalytic activity of Pd-Ir bimetal nanoparticles to the reduction of H2O2, leading to decrease in the current response signal. The decrease of the current response of the immunosensor has a linear relationship with the concentration of CEA ranging from 0.05 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.017 ng/mL at 3σ. The sensor provides a new simple method for the determination of CEA.

Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao,"Based on a series of test results, the one-dimensional consolidation coefficient and consolidation mechanism of plateau lacustrine peaty soil from Kunming and Dali city were studied, and some factors, such as the depth of sampling, consolidation pressure(p), loading method, loading ratio(R) and preloading were discussed. Test results showed that the consolidation coefficients(Cv) of peaty soil decreased with increasing of consolidation pressure firstly, then reduced slowly and stably. The relationship between the consolidation pressure and the consolidation coefficients of peaty soil was a power regression. Under preloading, the consolidation coefficients of peaty soil were pretty much exactly the same as the nature sample when preloading was lower than 100 kPa. It was lower than the nature sample once the preloading was larger than 200 kPa. When consolidation pressure was larger than 200 kPa, consolidation coefficients of peaty soil changed little with consolidation pressure increased.

Forests,"Species richness and turnover rates differed between the western and eastern aspects of Baima Snow Mountain: Maximum species richness (94 species in a transect of 1000 m2) was recorded at 2800 m on the western aspect and at 3400 m on the eastern aspect (126 species), which also recorded a much higher value of gamma diversity (501 species) than the western aspect (300 species). The turnover rates were the highest in the transition zones between different vegetation types, whereas species-area curves showed larger within-transect beta diversity at middle elevations. The effect of elevation on alpha diversity was due mainly to the differences in seasonal temperature and moisture, and these environmental factors mattered more than spatial distances to the turnover rates along the elevation gradient, although the impact of the environmental factors differed with the growth form (herb, shrubs or trees) of the species. The differences in the patterns of plant biodiversity between the two aspects helped to assess several hypotheses that seek to explain such patterns, to highlight the impacts of contemporary climate and historical and regional factors and to plan biological conservation and forest management in this region more scientifically. © 2016 by the authors.",Open Access,20161902367854,89.0,"Yang, Yang (1); Shen, Zehao (1); Han, Jie (1); Zhongyong, Ciren (2) ","(1) The MOE Key laboratory of Earth Surface Processes; Department of Ecology, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Baima Mountain National Reserve, Deqin, Yunnan; 674500, China ",,443.3 Precipitation - 454 Environmental Engineering - 481.1 Geology,,,,,Biodiversity - Forestry - Landforms - Snow,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shen, Zehao(shzh@pku.edu.cn) ",10.3390/f7040089,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19994907,"Number: 41371190, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31321061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31170449, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41371190, 31170449, 31321061).

Sci. Bull.,"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which has been documented in 190,000 cases of BSE-infected cattle, to our knowledge, has not been reported in buffalo. Prion protein (PrP) is critical to susceptibility and development of BSE. Moreover, a new PrP-like protein, Shadoo (Sho), has been shown to have overlapping expression patterns and shared functions with PrP. Therefore, we hypothesize that differences in expression at the transcriptional level and/or the post-transcriptional level of the two genes may be associated with these specific differences between cattle and buffalo. We compared the relative mRNA expression of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and the Shadoo gene (SPRN) in 396 RNA samples using real-time PCR. We also analyzed PrP/Sho protein from 96 samples by Western blot. Our results demonstrated significantly lower PrP expression in the cerebellum, obex, mesenteric lymph node, and bronchial lymph node tissues, but higher relative expression of Sho in the cerebrum and spleen in buffalos compared with cattles. Although these results support our primary assumption, Sho and PrP expressions did not correlate with corresponding mRNA expression, suggesting that the biological modulations of both PrP and Sho proteins are at post-translational levels. Moreover, positive correlations between PRNP and SPRN were found in cattle and buffalo cerebrum as well as in buffalo obex. Conversely, negative correlations between PrP and Sho were detected in buffalo cerebellum and obex tissues. These findings suggest that additional post-transcriptional studies are warranted to elucidate mechanisms behind prion diseases. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20162702549355,,"Zhao, Hui (1); Wang, Si-Qi (1, 3); Qing, Li-Li (1, 3); Liu, Lin-Lin (1, 3); Zhang, Ya-Ping (1, 2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-resource, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650223, China (3) School of Life Science, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Body fluids - Brain - Histology - Neurodegenerative diseases - Nucleic acids - Polymerase chain reaction - Proteins - Tissue - Transcription,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Ya-Ping(zhangyp@mail.kiz.ac.cn) ",10.1007/s11434-016-1130-y,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20959281,"Number: 31460038, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31060302, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31260032, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31060302, 31260032 and 31460038 ), and the Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in the University of Yunnan Province.",,20959273,17,"September 1, 2016",English,Praseodymium compounds,,35.0,1377-1383,,2016,Science in China Press,Science Bulletin,,Expression of BSE-associated proteins in the CNS and lymphoreticular tissues of cattle and buffalo,,Bovine spongiform encephalopathy - Buffalo - Cattle - Overlapping expression - Positive correlations - PRNP - SPRN - Transcriptional levels,61
Infrared Phys Technol,"Multi-scale transform (MST) is an efficient tool for image fusion. Recently, many fusion methods have been developed based on different MSTs, and they have shown potential application in many fields. In this paper, we propose an effective infrared and visible image fusion scheme in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain, in which the NSCT is firstly employed to decompose each of the source images into a series of high frequency subbands and one low frequency subband. To improve the fusion performance we designed two new activity measures for fusion of the lowpass subbands and the highpass subbands. These measures are developed based on the fact that the human visual system (HVS) percept the image quality mainly according to its some low-level features. Then, the selection principles of different subbands are presented based on the corresponding activity measures. Finally, the merged subbands are constructed according to the selection principles, and the final fused image is produced by applying the inverse NSCT on these merged subbands. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art fusion methods in terms of both visual effect and objective evaluation results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20161002078334,,"Li, Huafeng (1); Qiu, Hongmei (1); Yu, Zhengtao (1); Zhang, Yafei (1) ","(1) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan, Kunming; 650500, China ",IPTEEY,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing,,,,,Inverse problems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Zhengtao(ztyu@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.infrared.2016.02.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FD011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: KKSY201403116, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: KKSY201303086, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61562053, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61302041, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: KKZ3201303027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61302041 , 61562053 ), the Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department (No. 2013FD011 ), the Talent Cultivation Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology (No. KKZ3201303027 ), the Yunnan Provincial for Personnel Cultivation (Nos.

Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.,"The first arylation strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargylamines is disclosed. This approach, which is complementary to previous alkynylation and alkylation strategies, involves a C(sp2)−C(sp3) bond formation, and is based on the first asymmetric Friedel–Crafts-type arylation reaction of C-alkynyl imines. Asymmetric Friedel–Crafts reactions with electron-deficient phenols, a longstanding unsolved challenge, have thus been realized for the first time, enabled by the combination of our recently introduced C-alkynyl N-Boc-protected N,O-acetals as electrophiles and chiral phosphoric acids as catalysts. The synthetic utility of the resulting structurally diverse and polyfunctional chiral propargylamines was demonstrated by a series of selective transformations, including controlled reduction of the alkynyl group and iterative cross-couplings. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Global Planet. Change,"Rainfall erosivity (R) influences the formation mechanisms and succession processes of soil erosion. Knowing of the R factor facilitates the prediction of soil erosion and of the impact of climate change on erosion. However, defining of the R factor is challenging because its spatiotemporal variation can be complex. We combined the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), North criteria, and Mann-Kendall test (M-K) to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the R factor for a study area in a typical mountain plateau region of Yunnan Province (YP), China. Daily rainfall records from 1960 to 2012 were collected from 115 national meteorological observation stations in YP. Based on the daily rainfall erosivity estimating model, we determined that the average annual R factor was 4383.85 MJ·mm·ha− 1·h− 1, the seasonal R factor exhibited an order of summer > autumn > spring > winter, and the summer R was significantly higher than winter R. The spatiotemporal variation of the R factor was complex and did not reveal a uniform pattern. The spatial distribution revealed that the annual and seasonal R factors in the west were higher than those in the east, and R in the south were higher than those in the north. The temporal trends of annual, summer, and autumn R factors had decreasing trends from 1960 to 2012. On the contrary, the spring and winter R factors showed an increasing trend. The EOF analysis identified two typical spatiotemporal patterns of the annual R factor in YP, and three for spring, summer, autumn, and winter R factors. These patterns represented the influence of the monsoon, circulation systems, and complex terrain conditions on the rainfall in the YP. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20163102661830,,"Duan, Xingwu (1, 2); Gu, Zhijia (1); Li, Yungang (1, 2); Xu, Huijuan (1) ","(1) Institute of International Rivers and Eco–security, Yunnan University, Kunming; 60095, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory of International Rivers and Trans-boundary Eco–security, Yunnan University, Kunming; 10095, China ",GPCHE4,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Climate change - Erosion - Rain - Soils,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gu, Zhijia(guzhijia@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.07.011,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 41401614, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41561063, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41301099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013BAB06B03, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China (Grant number: 41561063 , 41301099 and 41401614 ), National Science and Technology Support Program ( 2013BAB06B03 ), and the Department of Water Resources of YP : Water Science and Technology Project.",,09218181,,"September 1, 2016",English,Orthogonal functions,,90.0,82-93,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Global and Planetary Change,,"The spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall erosivity in Yunnan Province, southwest China: An analysis of empirical orthogonal functions",,Daily rainfall records - Empirical Orthogonal Function - Meteorological observation stations - Rainfall erosivity - Soil erosion - Spatio-temporal variation - Spatiotemporal patterns - Yunnan province,144
Graphene Sci. Hand.: Appl. and Ind.,"During the next decades, the world's energy system may radi cally change with higher energy consumption by cleaner and more efficient methods. Fundamental and applied research about materials and processes, involved in each stage of the energy-generating chain (storage, distribution, and use), will be pivotal in facing this global challenge in a cleaner, safer, more efficient, and economical way. As continuously being pursued, integration in size and maximization in performance will dominate the development trend of the next genera tion of power sources, which can be motivated and provoked by the emerging of new-energy materials and technologies. Graphene, a new two-dimensional member of the carbon fam ily, possesses extraordinary properties, including the highest electron conductivity and mechanical strength as well as high hydrogen storage, etc., among all current materials and it is highly expected to be a promising potential energy material to improve the performances of various power sources. Since its successful availability by mechanical exfoliation in the lab in 2004, great progress has been made in the energy field with graphene as an active material. In this chapter, the state-of-the-art developments in graphene's applications for clean energy systems including lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells especially within 1-2 years are summarized and reviewed.

Kuei Suan Jen Hsueh Pao,"The h-BN-25%SiC multiphase ceramics were prepared via spark plasma sintering (SPS) using h-BN and SiC nanopowders as raw materials and B2O3as a sintering aid. The phase composition and microstructure were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electronic microscopy. Furthermore, the sintering behavior and the effect of sintering temperature on the densification, microstructure and mechanical properties of h-BN-SiC multiphase ceramics were investigated. The results show that the high density of the ceramics can be reached at a relatively low temperature in the SPS Process. The directional arrangement of h-BN grains promotes, and the density, grain size and mechanical properties (i.e., flexural strength, fracture toughness and elastic modulus) increase with increasing the sintering temperature. The increased fracture toughness is attributed to the intergranular fracture mode and h-BN grains, which cause crack deflection, grain pullout and the pinning effect of fine SiC particles. The flexural strength, fracture toughness and elastic modulus of the sample sintered at 1600 are 289.2 MPa, 3.45 MPa·m1/2and 150.9 GPa, respectively, which are better than those of other samples. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of the Chinese Ceramic Society.

High Temp Mater Processes,"This paper proposes an analytical approach to optimize the thickness of refractories for achieving maximum microwave power transmission in microwave heating based on the analysis of power transmission coefficient (PTC). The microwave PTCs of alumina (Al2O3) ceramics over the temperature range of 22-1,379°C at 2,450 MHz, mullite ceramics in the temperature range of 27-1,027°C at 2.45 GHz and 400-1,300°C at 915 MHz are studied. The results show that there are several transmission peaks in the PTC patterns. The transmission peak amplitude depends sensitively on the thickness of the refractory and the peak shifting towards a smaller thickness as the temperature of the refractory increases. We also show that high microwave transmission can only be achieved in a refractory with a small thickness corresponding to a slight transmission peak shift in the entire microwave heating (less than one eighth wavelength in the refractory). © 2016 by De Gruyter.",,20160301813260,,"Shang, Xiaobiao (1, 2, 3); Chen, Junruo (1); Peng, Jinhui (2, 3) ","(1) Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Natl.

Dianli Xitong Zidonghue,"With the development of DC distribution system, the network structure and operation mode of traditional distribution system have greatly changed. The AC/DC hybrid distribution network will be dominant in the future and poses a new challenge to power flow control and the AC/DC hybrid algorithm. For this reason, a hierarchical power flow control strategy is proposed to carry out orderly voltage control. At the first layer, DC load sharing is realized by the bidirectional converter with droop control, and DC bus voltage is controlled according to the droop control curve, at the second layer, local voltage balance is regulated by the distributed generator, while at the third, regional voltage is controlled by the voltage regulator.

Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst.,"We conducted a mineral magnetic study of river bank and subaqueous delta sediments from the Red River, in order to examine the role of sedimentary sorting on the variation of sedimentary magnetic properties from source to sink. The magnetic mineralogy mainly consists of magnetite and hematite. Bulk sediment particle-size variations have a strong influence on magnetic properties, with the frequently used magnetic parameters χfd%, χARM, χARM/χ, and χARM/SIRM exhibiting positive correlations with the 5 m water depth) part of the subaqueous delta have lower χ and SIRM values, a finer ferrimagnetic grain-size and higher proportions of hematite, consistent with selective loss of coarse ferrimagnetic grains on the source-to-sink pathway. We suggest that variations in magnetic properties in response to particle-size compositions and therefore depositional environment changes should be carefully addressed when magnetic proxies such as χARM/SIRM are used in the study of coastal and marine environmental changes (e.g., sea-level change). In such cases, the combined use of magnetic properties and geochemical indicators, such as Al/Ti ratio, may provide better results for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. © 2016.

ACM Int. Conf. Proc. Ser.,"Nowadays,shared-state scheduling architecturehas been paid more attention in the large-scale cluster scheduling area.As a crucial part of shared-state scheduling architecture, optimistic concurrency control (OCC) algorithm has been studied by database community for a long time. However, few studies aim at making it more suitable for shared-state scheduling environment. In this paper, wepropose an extended fine-grained conflict detection method for shared-state schedulingarchitecture. This method extends the original validation criteria of fine-grained conflict detection method and make it can detect complicated concurrent conflicts under high concurrency of scheduling transactions. We report experiments done on a public simulator by using Google production traces of data-processing workloads. These experiments demonstrate that the extended fine-grained conflict detection method obviously reduces the number of harmful conflicts and it has not led to the efficiency decrease of schedulers. © 2016 ACM.",,20171203474946,29.0,"He, Libo (1); Yao, Shaowen (1); Zhou, Wei (1) ","(1) Yunnan University, No.2 Cuihu North Rd, Kunming City, China ",,722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 912.2 Management,126594.0,"December 23, 2016 - December 25, 2016","Wuhan, China","2016 International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, ICIIP 2016",Cluster computing - Data handling - Scheduling,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1145/3028842.3028871,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 2015SE101, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61540061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61640306, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61363021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China(No.61363021,No.61540061,No.61640306) and Yunnan University and the Open Foundation of Software Engineering Key Laboratory in Yunnan Province under Grant No.2015SE101",9781450347990.0,,,"December 23, 2016",English,Concurrency control,"Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, ICIIP 2016",24.0,,1 of 1,2016,Association for Computing Machinery,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,CNKI; et al.; Guilin University of Technology; Jilin Institute of Chemical Technology; Wanfang Data; Wuhan University of Technology,An extended fine-grained conflict detection method for shared-state scheduling in large scale cluster,,Cluster scheduling - Conflict detection - Optimistic concurrency controls - Parallel schedulers - Shared state,
Bioresour. Technol.,"A novel cultivation strategy called 'Sequential Heterotrophy-Dilution-Photoinduction' was successfully applied in the cultivation of Galdieria sulphuraria for efficient production of phycocyanin (PC). Algae cells were firstly cultivated heterotrophically to achieve high cell density. The maximal dry cell weight of 17.8 g L-1and maximal biomass productivity of 103.1 mg L-1h-1were obtained. Then, a dilution step was applied to obtain a suitable cell concentration and finally these cells were transferred to high light condition for phycocyanin accumulation. During the photoinduction step, cells could accumulate phycocyanin up to 13.88% of dry cell weight in a cultivation period of 8 days. By this technology, total PC productivity far surpassed those reported in all literatures of Galdieria sulphuraria, and was 147-fold and 12-fold of those in photoautotrophic and heterotrophic technologies, respectively. Therefore, this strategy provides a promising approach for high-efficient phycocyanin production from Galdieria sulphuraria to meet its mass cultivation and commercialization application. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,20162702560805,,"Wan, Minxi (1); Wang, Zhenyang (1); Zhang, Zhen (1); Wang, Jun (2); Li, Shulan (3); Yu, Anquan (2); Li, Yuanguang (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai; 200237, China (2) Yunnan Shangrila Zeyuan Limited Company for Algal Health Technology, Diqing; 674412, China (3) Jiaxing Zeyuan Bio-Products Company Ltd., Jiaxing; 314006, China ",BIRTEB,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering,,,,,Cytology - Productivity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Yuanguang(ygli@ecust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.biortech.2016.06.045,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18732976,"Number: 2015AA020602, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National High-tech Research and Development Program; Number: 222201414024, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","This research was funded by National High Technology Research and Development Program of China ( 2015AA020602 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 222201414024 ).

Miner. Met. Mater. Ser.,"A novel adsorbent was prepared from granular red mud (GRM) mixed with cement and its potential to be a suitable adsorbent for removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions was evaluated. By investigating duration of oscillation, dosage of MB, pH and temperature on the adsorption effect, the best experimental condition was obtained: the methylene blue with the dosage of 150 mg/L and a constant pH of 11, after 240 minute oscillation at 303K, the removal of MB and the state balance of absorption capacity up to 86.89 % and 2.6040 mg/g. The equilibrium adsorption was found to increase with increase in temperature of the adsorption process. It was observed that the adsorption isotherms are well represented by both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. But because the Freundlich isotherm model had a better fitting, the adsorption was attributed to successive multilayer adsorption. Meanwhile, thermodynamic parameters depict the endothermic nature of adsorption and the process is spontaneous. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model was used to correlate the kinetic experimental data and the kinetic parameters were evaluated. © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society 2016.",,20180904845734,,"Shuaidan, Lu (1, 2, 3); Le, Thiquynhxuan (1, 2, 3); Ju, Shaohua (1, 2, 3); Jin-Hui, Peng (1, 2, 3); Li-Bo, Zhang (1, 2, 3) ","(1) National Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Engineering Applications of Microwave Energy and Equipment Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",,412.1 Cement - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity,210869.0,"March 3, 2013 - March 7, 2013","San Antonio, TX, United states","142nd Annual Meeting and Exhibition, TMS 2013",Adsorption isotherms - Aromatic compounds - Cements - Dyes - Kinetic parameters - Solutions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1007/978-3-319-65136-1_23,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),23671696,"Number: 51264022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors gratefully acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 51264022) for funding this work.,,23671181,210869,2016,English,Adsorption,,29.0,131-136,1 of 1,2016,Springer International Publishing,"Minerals, Metals and Materials Series",TMS Aluminum Committee,Removal of methylene blue from aqueous solutions using a novel granular red mud mixed with cement,,Experimental conditions - Freundlich isotherm model - Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models - Methylene Blue - Pseudo-second-order kinetic models - Red mud - Thermodynamic parameter - Waste water processing,
Hydrometallurgy,"In this paper, a novel combination of phase transformation and leaching is proposed to recover zinc from an oxide–sulphide zinc ore. Accordingly, various analytical technologies, such as X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, are employed. The phase transformation of a raw ore and the effects of microwave heating and Na2O2addition on zinc leaching are investigated. The results show that the addition of a strong oxide Na2O2can directly transform the refractory phases, particularly zinc sulphide, into zinc sulphate. As a result, SO2emissions are avoided and an environmentally friendly zinc recovery process is realised. Both microwave heating and the Na2O2level have significant effects on phase transformation and zinc leaching. The zinc leaching rate can reach 82.06% under the following conditions of microwave heating: adding Na2O2at a mass ratio of 25%, leaching in an ammonium chloride solution with a total ammonium concentration of 7.5 mol/L and an ammonia/ammonium chloride molar ratio of 1:1, adding NaClO as an aid-leaching reagent and leaching for 1 h. By contrast, the zinc leaching degree for the ore samples roasted in a traditional electric resistant furnace is only 30.62%. Moreover, at the same oxidation degree, the total energy consumption by the proposed process is 0.78 kWh/(kg·ore), which is lower than that by traditional heating (same power). Thus, the combination technology of microwave-heated phase transformation and leaching is effective in treating oxide–sulphide zinc ore. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20164703026397,,"Yang, Kun (1, 2, 3); Li, Shiwei (1, 2, 3); Zhang, Libo (1, 2, 3); Peng, Jinhui (1, 2, 3); Chen, Weiheng (1, 2, 3); Xie, Feng (1, 2, 3); Ma, Aiyuan (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) National Local Joint Laboratory of Engineering Application of Microwave Energy and Equipment Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",HYDRDA,525.3 Energy Utilization - 533.1 Ore Treatment - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Calcination - Chemical analysis - Chlorine compounds - Energy utilization - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Leaching - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Ore roasting - Phase transitions - Sodium compounds - Sulfur compounds - X ray diffraction - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy - Zinc ore treatment - Zinc sulfide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Shiwei(lswei11@163.com) ",10.1016/j.hydromet.2016.07.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 1319880206, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB643404, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China (973 Program, 2014CB643404 ) and Scholarship Award for Excellent Doctoral Student granted by the Ministry of Education, China ( 1319880206 ).",,0304386X,,"December 1, 2016",English,Ores,,49.0,243-251,,2016,Elsevier B.V.,Hydrometallurgy,,Microwave roasting and leaching of an oxide-sulphide zinc ore,,Ammonium chloride - Ammonium concentrations - Analytical technology - Combination technology - Leaching rates - Oxidation degree - Total energy consumption - Traditional heating,166
J. Surfactants Deterg.,"The environmentally friendly anionic surfactant fatty acid methyl ester sulfonate (MES) was prepared by esterification of waste cooking oil (WCO), a low-cost raw material, followed by sulfonation with chlorosulfonic acid. MES production from WCO (W-MES) gave yields up to 78 %. Such a value is only slightly lower than the one obtained from soybean oil (S-MES), 82 %, and almost the same as that from reused cooking oil (R-MES), 76 %. According to the two-phase titration results, the content of the active component, α-MES, in S-MES, R-MES and W-MES was equal to 76.82, 69.19 and 66.60 %, respectively. The disalt, RCH(CO2Na)SO3Na, contents were instead 3.2, 3.8 and 4.7 %, respectively. As proved by the results of the FTIR and NMR characterizations, the chemical structure of W-MES is almost the same as that of S-MES and R-MES. The critical micelle concentration of W-MES is 5.38 mmol/L and the corresponding surface tension is 32.3 mN/m. The hydrophile-lipophile balance value of W-MES is 12.33, which indicates that it can form oil/water emulsions. The three MES demonstrated the same adsorption efficiency, yielding a pC20 value of 3.22, and similar foam stability. Their detergency can be up to 75 % at a concentration of 400 mg/kg and the tolerance to Ca2+is higher than the one exhibited by linear alkylbenzene sulphonic acid and alpha olefin sulfonate. Additionally, W-MES shows a considerable solubilization capacity towards polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon as the molar solubilization ratios to pyrene, phenanthrene and acenaphthene in a 30 mmol/L solution are 1.22 × 10−3, 2.67 × 10−3and 3.81 × 10−3, respectively. © 2016, AOCS.",,20161302168401,,"Jin, Yueming (1); Tian, Senlin (1); Guo, Jiali (1); Ren, Xiao (1); Li, Xinyan (1); Gao, Shumei (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",JSDEFL,461.9 Biology - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Anionic surfactants - Biophysics - Critical micelle concentration - Esterification - Esters - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - Solubility - Soybean oil - Sulfonation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tian, Senlin(tiansenlin@outlook.com) ",10.1007/s11743-016-1813-z,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15589293,,,,10973958,3,"May 1, 2016",English,Fatty acids,,40.0,467-475,,2016,Springer Verlag,Journal of Surfactants and Detergents,,"Synthesis, Characterization and Exploratory Application of Anionic Surfactant Fatty Acid Methyl Ester Sulfonate from Waste Cooking Oil",,Alpha olefin sulfonates - Chlorosulfonic acid - Fatty acid methyl ester - Hydrophile-lipophile balance - Low-cost raw materials - Molar solubilization ratios - Solubilization capacities - Waste cooking oil,19

However, data sparsity problem results in the low prediction accuracy and the poor recommendation quality. To resolve this problem, the present study proposed an improved recommendation method with weighted Slope one algorithm. The method calculates the similarity between users based on users' ratings, so as to find every user's nearest neighbors. Based on the nearest neighbor's ratings, weighted Slope one algorithm is used to predict the unknown ratings of the target user and to present recommendation results. In the experiment, MovieLens data set was used to test the recommendation accuracy of the method. The experimental results suggest that the improved algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of rating prediction and the recommendation performance. © 2016 IEEE.",,20163602765875,7531393.0,"Wang, Panpan (1); Qian, Qian (1); Shang, Zhenhong (1); Li, Jingsong (1) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Computer Technology Applications, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650504, China ",,,123193.0,"May 28, 2016 - May 30, 2016","Yinchuan, China","28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016",,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/CCDC.2016.7531393,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467397148.0,,,"August 3, 2016",English,,"Proceedings of the 28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016",13.0,2431-2434,,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of the 28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016",,An recommendation algorithm based on weighted Slope one algorithm and user-based collaborative filtering,,,

In each quadrat, the ants from the land surface, soil and plants were investigated. After the sample-plot investigation, all places in the sample-plot were investigated by 5 people for one hour. Result: A total of 20 371 ant individuals were collected from Galongla Mountains and Medog Valley, and belonged to 96 species, 45 genera, and 8 subfamilies of Formicidae. The subfamily of Myrmicinae was richest in genera and species (18 genera and 44 species involved) among the 8 subfamilies, followed by Ponerinae with 24 species in 10 genera. The subfamilies of Pseudomyrmecinae, Dorylinae and Leptanillinae each had only 1 genus and 1 species. The genus of Pheidole was richest in species (10 species involved) among the 45 genera. Most ant species from Galongla Mountains and Medog Valley distributed below the elevation of 2 000 m. Over the all species, Pheidole sagei had the widest range in vertical distribution, and the elevation difference was up to 1 510 m. Valley rainforest was richest in ant species among the 10 habitat types. The ant species nesting and forage on the ground were the richest among all types of nesting and forge sites. In addition, some species could also forge on the tree. Moreover, 95 ant species distributed in south slope and only 5 species distributed in north slope. Myrmica bactriana occupied the widest range of habitats, nesting and forage sites. Conclusion: The distribution of ant species in Galongla Mountains and Medog Vally is restricted by altitude and plant richness. At the same time, distribution patterns of ant species are affected by slope aspect. As for nesting and forging sites choice, ants firstly ensure the nest relatively dry and the plentiful source of food. Thus ants choose different habitat and foraging and nesting sites, which would avoid the intraspecific and interspecific competition and be in favor of the establishment and development of ant colony. © 2016, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

"Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Electron. Inf. Commun. Technol., ICEICT","Traditionally, the smallest unit of virtual scene is a model. In order to make use of the computer resources, the model is generally only loaded in a certain range of the current perspective. But in the virtual scene any browser can't observe all surfaces of this model in an angle of view invariable situation. Therefore it has wasted the massive computer resources similarly [1]. This project proposes a new framework model. Firstly, the minimum division unit of the virtual scene is changed into surface and loading the visible surface within the current viewpoint and preloading surface within a certain range of the current viewpoint to construct the current scene. Again taking the current viewpoint coordinates as the center, a layer of a layer of the outer surface of the visual surface is loaded on the coordinate system to form a radar coverage network. Secondly using the background management technology based on SSH2 to realize the model unified management and combing with the foreground X3D to generate the required scenes in real time, so as to achieve the goal of reducing rendering time of the virtual scene, saving computer resources and changing old patterns of environment fixed. © 2016 IEEE.",,20171503559887,7879683.0,"Wu, Xu (1); Lei, Wu (1); Tong, Duan Xi (1); Long, Ren Yi (1); Jin, He (1) ","(1) School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 951 Materials Science",126845.0,"August 20, 2016 - August 22, 2016","Harbin, China","2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016",Surfaces - Virtual reality,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICEICT.2016.7879683,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509007288.0,,,"March 15, 2017",English,Computer resource management,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016",8.0,199-202,1 of 1,2016,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology, ICEICT 2016","China Academy of Space Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Space Microwave; Science and Technology on Millimeter-Wave Laboratory; State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University",Research of the optimization and utilization of computer resources based on X3D scene and SSH2 surface framework,,Background managements - Co-ordinate system - Computer resources - Framework models - Rendering time - SSH2 - Viewpoint - Virtual scenes,

Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol.,"There is increasing concern about the enantioselective effects of chiral herbicides. To study the enantioselective toxicity of the chiral herbicide imazamox on maize, maize seedlings (Zhengda 619, Zea mays L.) were exposed to imazamox racemate and enantiomers in hydroponic experiments. The results showed that imazamox enantiomers selectively affected maize. The effective concentration of Rac-, S- and R-imazamox that caused 50 % inhibition after 5 days treatments (EC50,5d) were 0.4212, 1.2142 and 0.2460 mg L-1, respectively, for maize root length; 0.0002, 0.1005, 0.0032 mg L-1, respectively, for maize root fresh weight; 0.7114, 1.4056 and 0.4530 mg L-1, respectively, for maize shoot height; 0.6220, 1.5418, 0.2286 mg L-1, respectively, for maize shoot fresh weight; and 0.1100, 0.3306, 0.0307 mg L-1, respectively, for the total chlorophyll content of leaves. The root morphological parameters and root activity reflected the toxicity effects in the order R-imazamox > Rac-imazamox > S-imazamox. Maize roots were more sensitive to imazamox than maize shoots. The chiral herbicide imazamox poses enantioselective phytotoxicity on maize seedlings: the order of toxicity is R-imazamox > Rac-imazamox > S-imazamox. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media.",,20154401471719,,"Wei, Jing (1); Zhang, Xiaoxiao (1, 2); Li, Xuesheng (1); Zeng, Dongqiang (1); Tan, Huihua (1) ","(1) Institute of Pesticide and Environmental Toxicology, Guangxi University, Nanning; Guangxi; 530005, China (2) Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xishuangbanna; Yunnan; 666303, China ",BECTA6,461.7 Health Care - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products,,,,,Enantiomers - Enantioselectivity - Herbicides - Plants (botany) - Toxicity - Weed control,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tan, Huihua(jeffthh@163.com) ",10.1007/s00128-015-1682-6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320800,,,,00074861,2,February 2016,English,Grain (agricultural product),,27.0,242-247,,2016,Springer New York LLC,Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,,Enantioselective Phytotoxicity of Imazamox Against Maize Seedlings,,Effective concentration - Enantioselective effects - Hydroponic experiments - Imazamox - Maize - Morphological parameters - Phytotoxicity - Total chlorophyll,96
"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf. Bioinform. Biomed., BIBM","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious disease that presents a major health problem worldwide. There is a desperate need to explore novel biomarkers to further facilitate the early diagnosis and effective treatment in DKD patients so that to prevent them to develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, most of regulation mechanisms at genetic level in DKD still remain unclear. In this work-in-progress paper, we describe our innovative methodologies that integrate biological, statistics, and computational approaches to investigate important roles performed by regulations among microRNAs (miRs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in DKD. We conducted a series of experiments and identified a list of miRs and lncRNAs as potential novel biomarkers, along with the set of target genes regulated by discovered miRs. Our initial analysis results are promising in better understanding regulation mechanisms of miRs and lncRNAs on the pathogenesis and progression of DKD. © 2016 IEEE.",,20170803377740,7822601.0,"Zhang, Lihua (1); Li, Rong (2); Yang, Qiuping (1); Wu, Yanan (1); Huang, Jingshan (3); Wu, Bin (4) ","(1) Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650031, China (2) Department of Nephrology, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, Yunnan; 650032, China (3) Computer Science Department, School of Computing, University of South Alabama, Mobile; AL; 36688, United States (4) Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650031, China ",,461 Bioengineering and Biology,125905.0,"December 15, 2016 - December 18, 2016","Shenzhen, China","2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, BIBM 2016",Bioinformatics - Biomarkers - Diagnosis - Medical problems - Nucleic acids - Patient treatment - RNA,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Jingshan(huang@southalabama.edu) ",10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822601,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 2016NS019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Health and Family Planning Commission of Gansu; Number: 2016FB127, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: NCI, Sponsor: National Cancer Institute; Number: U01CA180982, Acronym: NIH, Sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Number: CYZ15-08, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 81560126, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Research in this paper was partially supported by: Yunnan Health and Family Planning Commission (2016NS019); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Regional Science Fund Project 81560126); Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (2016FB127); Chengdu Medical College (CYZ15-08); and National Cancer Institute at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (U01CA180982).

Chem. Eng. Trans.,"High specific surface areas mesoporous carbon materials were prepared by a combined method of carbonization and activation processes, in which Chinese herb residue was used as carbon source, and KOH was used as activator, respectively. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were employed to determine by the specific surface areas and pore analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy(SEM) was used for analyzing morphology structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used for analyzing the crystal forms of the materials. Thesurface functional groups were tested by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the optimum KOH/carbon ration and activation temperature is 4:1and 750°C for the mesoporous carbon materials prepared with traditional Chinese medicine residue. The structure of the materials were of non-graphitized carbonaceous materials, which possess the best surface morphology and porous performance. The porous structure of the surface is a regular shape, and the specific surface is as were as high as 2079 m2/g.

Environ. Sci. Technol.,"Ammonia (NH3) released to the atmosphere leads to a cascade of impacts on the environment, yet estimation of NH3volatilization from cropland soils (VNH3) in a broad spatial scale is still quite uncertain in China. This mainly stems from nonlinear relationships between VNH3and relevant factors. On the basis of 495 site-years of measurements at 78 sites across Chinese croplands, we developed a nonlinear Bayesian tree regression model to determine how environmental factors modulate the local derivative of VNH3to nitrogen application rates (Nrate) (VR, %). The VNH3-Nraterelationship was nonlinear. The VR of upland soils and paddy soils depended primarily on local water input and Nrate, respectively. Our model demonstrated good reproductions of VNH3compared to previous models, i.e., more than 91% of the observed VR variance at sites in China and 79% of those at validation sites outside China. The observed spatial pattern of VNH3in China agreed well with satellite-based estimates of NH3column concentrations. The average VRs in China derived from our model were 14.8 ± 2.9% and 11.8 ± 2.0% for upland soils and paddy soils, respectively. The estimated annual NH3emission in China (3.96 ± 0.76 TgNH3·yr-1) was 40% greater than that based on the IPCC Tier 1 guideline. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,20160401852895,,"Zhou, Feng (1); Ciais, Philippe (2); Hayashi, Kentaro (3); Galloway, James (4); Kim, Dong-Gill (5); Yang, Changliang (6); Li, Shiyu (6); Liu, Bin (6); Shang, Ziyin (1); Gao, Shuoshuo (1) ","(1) Institute of Integrated Watershed Management, Sino-France Institute of Earth Systems Science, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif-sur-Yvette; 91191, France (3) Carbon and Nutrient Cycles Division, National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, 3-1-3, Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki; 305-8604, Japan (4) Environmental Sciences Department, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; VA; 22904, United States (5) Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resources, Hawassa University, Shashemene, Ethiopia (6) Research Institute of Engineering Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",ESTHAG,483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Regression analysis - Soils,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Feng(zhouf@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acs.est.5b03156,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205851,,,,0013936X,2,"January 19, 2016",English,Rhenium compounds,,44.0,564-572,,2016,American Chemical Society,Environmental Science and Technology,,Re-estimating NH3Emissions from Chinese Cropland by a New Nonlinear Model,,Bayesian trees - Environmental factors - Nitrogen application rates - Non-linear model - Non-linear relationships - Spatial patterns - Spatial scale - Upland soil,50

This paper introduces 0–1 test for chaos and Poincare sections, for the characterization of multiphase mixing effects based on computational homology and image analysis. Experimental results show that the chaotic behavior in multiphase mixing process can be decided by calculating the median (K) of parameter K-c approaching asymptotically to zero or one, and the value of parameter K may give a good quantification of multiphase mixing effects. Finally, it is illustrated to verify the theoretical analysis according to Poincare sections and the largest Lyapunov exponents.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"To calculate the similarity or dissimilarity of DNA sequences, a new method is proposed based on pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) model. First, according to the characteristics of PCNN model, we encode DNA primary sequences using a simple coding method. Then we use PCNN model to extract the entropy sequence (ES) of the encoded DNA sequence; the ES expresses the features of the DNA sequences. At last, we calculate the similarity of the ES by Euclidean distance to get the similarity of DNA sequences. We take several sets of data to test our method.

With increasing growth temperature, Ge films undergo a transition from amorphous to microcrystalline, then to polycrystalline. After annealing, these thin films transform into polycrystalline films with the (111) preferred orientation and identical crystal sizes. The surfaces of the amorphous and microcrystalline Ge films are severely coarsened, whereas the polycrystalline Ge film still displays a smooth surface. The growth mechanisms of Ge films with different crystalline phases in the annealing process are discussed, which can explain their morphology evolutions.

Results showed that the gasification reactivity of PC not only increased with the increase of catalyst-loaded, but also showed the effective improvement by anhydrous alcohol. The PC was mixed with potassium carbonate [K2CO3] catalyst at 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.0% and 1.5%, and then ground wet with distilled water. The CO2-gasification rate of PC was only 77.35%, 80.55%, 84.07% and 85.88% under the gasification temperature 1100 ° C and holding time 120 min, at different K2CO3 respectively. However, when the PC was ground in anhydrous alcohol at the same condition of catalyst-loading, the gasification rate of PC reached 95.43%, 96.63%, 95.50% and 95.61% at the holding time of 108 min, 101 min, 74 min and 35 min, respectively.

J. Eng. Sci. Technol. Rev.,"Energy and environmental issues are the main reasons many countries increasingly emphasize the energy efficiency of buildings. Passive low-energy buildings (PLEBs) emerged as a new trend in the development of the energy efficiency of buildings given their comfort and high energy efficiency. However, cost hinders the promotion of PLEBs in developing areas. This study focuses on buildings in Northwest China. A PLEB was analyzed by introducing the solar heating system as well as its economic and environmental indicators. This study aims to explore the economic and environmental benefits (EEBs) of low-cost PLEBs. First, the structures and parameters of the envelope were confirmed according to the specifications of PLEB and new energy-saving building (ESB) respectively. Second, energy consumption for heating was resolved using the PHHP software package of PLEB and the energy simulation software DeST-h. These methods confirmed the design scheme of the solar heating system of the PLEB and the ESB. Finally, the ESB was used as basis for analyzing the economic performance of the PLEB in terms of incremental cost and annual earnings. Results show that energy consumption for heating in winter and investment in the solar heating system for the PLEB is lower than that for the ESB, whereas the total incremental cost of the PLEB is higher than that of the ESB. These results are based on the premise of guaranteeing indoor thermal comfort in winter. The PLEB has higher EEBs than the ESB when the service life of solar heating systems is used as calculation period. The results of this study have important reference value for the research on low-cost PLEBs in areas with rich renewable resources. © 2016 Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"In this paper, 3 classic suffix type algorithms: QS, Tuned BM and BMHq were improved by reducing the average cost of basic operations. Firstly, the multi-windows method was used to let the calculations of the jump distance run in parallel and pipelining. Secondly, the comparison unit was increased to integer to reduce the total number and the average cost of comparisons. Especially for BMHq, the jump distance was increased by good prefix rule and the operations to get the jump distance were simplified by unaligned integer read. Thus, 3 algorithms named QSMI, TBMMI and BMHqMI were presented.

The phase structures, size of particles, morphology, and electrochemical performance of pristine and ZnO-coated LiMn2O4powders are studied in detail by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge test, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD patterns indicated that surface-modified ZnO have no obvious effect on the bulk structure of the LiMn2O4. TEM and XPS proved ZnO formation on the surface of the LiMn2O4particles. Galvanostatic charge/discharge test and rate performance showed that the ZnO coating could improve the capacity and cycling performance of LiMn2O4. The 2 wt% ZnO-coated LiMn2O4sample exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 112.8 mAh g−1with a capacity retention of 84.1 % after 500 cycles at 0.5 C.

Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,"A special 2-m Ring Solar Telescope (2-m RST) is to be built by YNAO-Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, Kunming, China. Its distinct primary mirror is distinctively shaped in a ring with an outer diameter of 2.02 m and a ring width of 0.35 m. Careful calculation and optimization of the mirror support pattern have been carried out first of all to define optimum blank parameters in view of performance balance of support design, fabrication and cost. This paper is to review the special consideration and optimization of the support design for the unique ring mirror. Schott zerodur is the prevailing candidate for the primary mirror blank. Diverse support patterns with various blank thicknesses have been discussed by extensive calculation of axial support pattern of the mirror. We reached an optimum design of 36 axial supports for a blank thickness of 0.15 m with surface error of 5 nm RMS. Afterwards, lateral support scheme was figured out for the mirror with settled parameters. A classical push-And-pull scheme was used. Seeing the relative flexibility of the ring mirror, special consideration was taken to unusually set the acting direction of the support forces not in the mirror gravity plane, but along the gravity of the local virtual slices of the mirror blank. Nine couples of the lateral push-pull force are considered. When pointing to horizon, the mirror surface exhibits RMS error of 5 nm with three additional small force couples used to compensate for the predominant astigmatism introduced by lateral supports. Finally, error estimation has been performed to evaluate the surface degradation with introduced errors in support force and support position, respectively, for both axial and lateral supports. Monte Carlo approach was applied using unit seeds for amplitude and position of support forces. The comprehensive optimization and calculation suggests the support systems design meet the technic requirements of the ring mirror of the 2-m RST. © 2016 SPIE.",,20165003104185,990651.0,"Yang, Dehua (1); Jin, Zhenyu (2); Liu, Zhong (2) ","(1) College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing; 211106, China (2) Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650216, China ",PSISDG,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 921.5 Optimization Techniques,124953.0,"June 26, 2016 - July 1, 2016","Edinburgh, United kingdom",Ground-Based and Airborne Telescopes VI,Airborne telescopes - Errors - Optimization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Dehua(dhyang@nuaa.edu.cn) ",10.1117/12.2232507,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),1996756X,,,9781510601918.0,0277786X,,2016,English,Mirrors,Ground-Based and Airborne Telescopes VI,4.0,,1of1,2016,SPIE,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE),Support optimization of the ring primary mirror of a 2-m solar telescope,,Astronomical observatories - Comprehensive optimizations - Mirror supports - Monte Carlo approach - Relative flexibility - Sensitivity estimation - Solar telescope - Support optimizations,9906
Guangxue Xuebao,"Space debris detection using superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SSPD) as detectors is proposed and both theoretically and equivalent experimentally verified. The multi-detection characteristic of SSPD during gating period is analyzed, and the signal noise ratio (SNR) model with echo photon number is established. Effects of laser repetition rate, sky background noise rate and dark count rate of SSPD on SNR are discussed. Taking the kHz laser ranging system of Yunnan Observatories as an example, combined with the echo photon number equation, it implies that the kHz laser ranging system at Yunnan Observatories has the capability for 1 m2space debris detection from 830 km away. Considering the fiber coupling requirement, an experimental curve of SNR versus echo number is obtained, which verifies the proposed method.

In order to demonstrate the performance of MOA-clustering method, it is applied to group six real-life datasets to obtain their clustering results, which may be compared with those received by employing K-means algorithm, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The results show that the proposed clustering algorithm is an effective and feasible method to reach a high accurate rate and stability in clustering problems. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,20163902840327,,"Zhang, Qin-Hu (1); Li, Bao-Lei (1); Liu, Ya-Jie (1); Gao, Lian (1); Liu, Lan-Juan (1); Shi, Xin-Ling (1) ","(1) Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650091, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis",,,,,Birds - Cluster analysis - Data mining - Genetic algorithms - Heuristic methods - Particle swarm optimization (PSO),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shi, Xin-Ling(xlshi@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s13042-014-0294-5,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1868808X,,,,18688071,5,"October 1, 2016",English,Clustering algorithms,,17.0,773-782,,2016,Springer Verlag,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,,Data clustering using multivariant optimization algorithm,,Cluster centers - Clustering methods - Clustering problems - Data clustering - Genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimizations - Heuristic optimization algorithms - Local optimizations - Optimization algorithms,7
J. Biomater. Appl.,"Objective To evaluate the effects of porous gradient composites with hydroxyapatite/zirconia and autologous iliac in repair of lumbar vertebra body defects in dogs. Methods (1) New porous gradient hydroxyapatite/zirconia composites were prepared using foam immersion, gradient compound and high temperature sintering; (2) A total of 18 adult beagle dogs, aged five to eight months and weighted 10-13 kg, were randomly assigned into two subgroups, which were implanted with new porous gradient hydroxyapatite/zirconia composites (subgroup A in 12) or autologous iliac bone (subgroup B in 6); (3) The post-operative data were analyzed and compared between the subgroups to repair the vertebral body defect by roentgenoscopy, morphology and biomechanics. Results The porosity of new porous gradient hydroxyapatite/zirconia composites is at 25 poles per inch, and the size of pores is at between 150 and 300 μm. The post-operative roentgenoscopy displayed that new-bone formation is increased gradually, and the interface between composites and host-bone becomes became blur, and the new-bone around the composites were integrated into host-bone at 24 weeks postoperatively in subgroup A. As to subgroup B, the resorption and restructure were found at six weeks after the surgery, and the graft-bone and host-bone have been integrated completely without obvious boundary at 24 weeks postoperatively. Histomorphologic study showed that the amount of bone within pores of the porous gradient hydroxyapatite/zirconia composites increased continuously with a prolonged implantation time, and that partial composites were degradated and replaced by new-bone trabeculae. There was no significant difference between subgroups (P > 0.05) in the ultimate compressive strengths. Conclusion New porous gradient hydroxyapatite/zirconia composites can promote the repair of bony defect, and induce bone tissue to ingrow into the pores, which may be applied widely to the treatment of bony defect in the future. © SAGE Publications 2015.",,20161402179280,,"Shao, Rong-Xue (1); Quan, Ren-Fu (2); Huang, Xiao-Long (1); Wang, Tuo (1); Xie, Shang-Ju (2); Gao, Huan-Huan (3); Wei, Xi-Cheng (4); Yang, Di-Sheng (5) ","(1) Research Institute of Orthopedics, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Zhejiang, China (2) Department of Orthopedics, Xiaoshan Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital, Zhejiang; 311200, China (3) Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, YunNan, China (4) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China (5) Department of Orthopedics, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China ",JBAPEL,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.5 Maintenance - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Composite materials - Compressive strength - Defects - Foams - Hydroxyapatite - Musculoskeletal system - Repair - Sintering - Tissue - Tissue engineering - X ray apparatus - Zirconia,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Quan, Ren-Fu(spinequan@yahoo.com) ",10.1177/0885328215627616,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15308022,,,,08853282,9,"April 1, 2016",English,Bone,,31.0,1312-1321,,2016,SAGE Publications Ltd,Journal of Biomaterials Applications,,Evaluation of porous gradient hydroxyapatite/zirconia composites for repair of lumbar vertebra defect in dogs,,artificial vertebrae - Bone formation - Bone tissue engineering - Gradient composites - High-temperature sintering - Implantation time - Lumbar vertebra - Ultimate compressive strength,30
Bio-Med. Mater. Eng.,"Background: The simulated Doppler blood flow signals are widely used to assess the performance of the clutter filters for removing wall components while reserving low-velocity signals scattered from physiological blood flow approaching the inner vessel-wall injured by a stenosed lesion. Objective: By simultaneously taking into account the natural attributes of the Doppler equipment, blood flow as well as vessel wall of pulsatile carotid arteries with a stenosis, a computer simulation method is presented to produce the compound Doppler ultrasound blood flow signals. Methods: The in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) axial as well as radial blood flow signals are simulated by superposing a series of cosine functions regulated by the spectrograms estimated from the axial and radial velocity profiles firstly obtained through the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, respectively. Meanwhile, the I/Q Doppler signals echoed from pulsatile near (anterior) and far (posterior) walls are reproduced based on their radial movements during a cardiac cycle. Ultimately, those confirmed quadrature signals are summed to generate the compound Doppler signals including the contribution from both blood flow and stenosed vessel-wall. Results: The compound Doppler ultrasound signals echoed from both axial and radial blood flows as well as vessel walls with obstruction grades of 0% (normal arteries), 10% and 25% are simulated respectively. The real signals from the left carotid artery with an approximately 10% stenosis degree are also collected for further assessing the believability of simulated versions. Conclusions: The simulated and clinical tests demonstrate that the proposed computer simulation method can produce compound Doppler signals with confirmed qualitative and quantitative characteristics resembled with the clinical versions, which could be used as an theoretical data source for evaluating the performance of the signal separation between pulsatile blood flows and vessel walls with mild stenosed-lesions. © 2016 IOS Press and the authors.",,20163502749901,,"Gao, Lian (1); Zhang, Yufeng (1); Zhou, Yi (1); Hu, Xiao (1); Deng, Li (1); Zhang, Kexin (2); Cai, Guanghui (1); Zhang, Junhua (1) ","(1) Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Cardiovascular Department, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical College, Kunming, Yunnan; 650031, China ",BMENEO,"461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 751.1 Acoustic Waves - 752.1 Acoustic Devices - 753.1 Ultrasonic Waves - 921.2 Calculus - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations",,,,,Acoustic devices - Blood - Blood vessels - Cosine transforms - Hemodynamics - Navier Stokes equations - Non Newtonian flow - Ultrasonic waves,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yufeng(yfengzhang@yahoo.com) ",10.3233/BME-161573,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18783619,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013FA008, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Grant (61261007), (61361010), (61561049) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Grant (2013FA008) from the Key Program of Yunnan Natural Science Foundation.",,09592989,2-3,"August 12, 2016",English,Underwater acoustics,,26.0,131-148,,2016,"IOS Press, Nieuwe Hemweg 6B, Amsterdam, 1013 BG, Netherlands",Bio-Medical Materials and Engineering,,Compound Doppler ultrasound signal simulation for pulsatile carotid arteries with a stenosis,,Carotid artery - Doppler blood flow signals - Doppler signals - Doppler ultrasound signals - Incompressible Navier Stokes equations - physiological pulsation - Quantitative characteristics - Radial velocity,27
Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng.,"In this paper, we study a dynamic fluid–structure interaction (FSI) model for an elastic structure immersed and spinning in the fluid. To describe the motion of a rotating elastic structure, we develop a linear constitutive model, that is suitable for the application of the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method in FSI simulations. Additionally, a new ALE mapping method is designed to generate the moving fluid mesh while the deformable structure spins in a non-axisymmetric fluid channel. The structure velocity is adopted as the principle unknown to form a monolithic saddle-point system together with fluid velocity and pressure. Using the mixed finite element method and Newton's linearization, we discretize the nonlinear saddle-point system, and prove that the discrete saddle-point system is well-posed. The developed methodology is applied to a self-defined elastic structure and a realistic hydro-turbine under a prescribed angular velocity. Numerical validation is also conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the models and the numerical methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,20164302932073,,"Yang, Kai (1); Sun, Pengtao (2); Wang, Lu (3); Xu, Jinchao (4); Zhang, Lixiang (5) ","(1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, 496 Lomita Mall, Stanford; CA; 94305, United States (2) Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nevada Las Vegas, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas; NV; 89154, United States (3) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Avenue, Livermore; CA; 94550, United States (4) Department of Mathematics, Pennsylvania State University, University park; PA; 16802, United States (5) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, 68 Wenchang Road, Yunnan, China ",CMMECC,601.1 Mechanical Devices - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Elasticity - Lagrange multipliers - Numerical methods - Rotating machinery,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Sun, Pengtao(pengtao.sun@unlv.edu) ",10.1016/j.cma.2016.09.020,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 20135314130002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: 51279071, Acronym: PSU, Sponsor: Pennsylvania State University; Number: 91430215, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: DMS-1418806, Acronym: NSF, Sponsor: National Science Foundation; Number: DE-SC0009249, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: DE-SC0014400, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","All the authors were partially supported by the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department Research Award: Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Mathematics and Mechanics with Applications in Energy Engineering.

Tumu Gongcheng Xuebao,"The expansive soil is characterized with the moisture change induced swelling and drying shrinkage, which may further lead to the crack propagation, and the strength, permeability and deformation properties of expansive soil are generally influenced by crack patterns. Based on the elasticity theory, the moisture change instead of matric suction was adopted to analyze the stress state and deformation properties of expansive soil, and the analytical solution of moisture-change induced stress was deduced with the consideration of moisture change. The initial cracking model based on moisture change was established in combination with the static equilibrium and the shear strength theory of saturated soil. The analytical expressions for the depth, spacing and width of initial cracks induced by water loss were achieved, and furthermore, the proposed model was validated by the test results of crack propagation. The sensitive analysis was also conducted for the relationships between spacing and width of initial cracks and elasticity modulus, shrinkage coefficient, distribution coefficient of moisture change and cohesion etc. of soil. © 2016, Editorial Office of China Civil Engineering Journal.

Guangxue Xuebao,"Optical efficiency differences between the evacuated tube receiver and a triangular cavity receiver are theoretically analyzed. Furthermore, the calculation expressions of the critical installation position for the optimal effective absorptivity of the cavity receiver are given, which is validated through TracePro software simulation. Simulation results show that the optical efficiency of cavity receiver can reach89.1%, while the evacuated tube's efficiency is 77.1%. Meanwhile, the installation position deviations in the vertical or parallel direction have similar impacts on efficiencies of both receivers, but the cavity's efficiency curve is slightly asymmetrical, which indicates that the best vertical installation position is 5~20 mm below focal length. It is also observed that mirror deflection error has greater influence on receiver efficiency, and the deflection angle should be controlled within 0.4°. Beyond this range, the descend degree of cavity receiver efficiency is less than the evacuated tube, which is confirmed by experimental test results. In addition, the thermal efficiencies of both receivers would meet at equilibrium point of 55.0%, in the case of ideal installation condition and heat collecting temperature of 168.6. Below this critical temperature, cavity receiver has a higher efficiency. © 2016, Chinese Laser Press.

Shipin Kexue/Food Sc.,"The aroma components of sun-dried and baked black teas, three replicates each, extracted with headspace solidphase microextraction (HS-SPME) were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Their similarities and differences were compared by using principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis (CA). A total of 76 aroma components were identified in these two kinds of black tea, mainly including alcohols, ketones, and esters compounds. Among them, alcohol compounds were the most abundant components in sun-dried black tea (57.43%) and baked black tea (60.45%), mainly including linalool, linalool oxides, geraniol, nerolidol, etc. The aroma components of sundried and baked black teas were very similar and difficult to distinguish from each other. However, PCA and CA showed that sun-dried and baked black teas could be clearly distinguished according to their volatile characteristics, which illustrated that drying methods have influences on aroma components of black tea. Therefore, HS-SPME-GC-MS in combination with multivariate statistical methods could provide a feasible and rapid technique to differentiate between sun-dried and baked black teas based on their volatile components and relative contents. © 2016, China Food Publishing Company.

Shipin Kexue/Food Sc.,"Fresh tea leaves from four different varieties picked in summer and those picked in three different seasons from tea populations from Huangshan mountain region, all of which were collected from the growing area of Qingdao, were processed into green tea by spreading, fixing, rolling, drying and aroma improvement. Using headspace solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, aroma components and proportions were analyzed. A total of forty-five main aroma components of different varieties from Qingdao green tea were identified.

Int. J. Signal Process. Image Process. Pattern Recogn.,"To improve the Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) algorithm such as artificial threshold setting and the choice and ordering of continuous points on circle, a novel compass detection algorithm is proposed. The algorithm uses four compasses as the test mask and calculates threshold value based on image intensity feature. Four compasses are used to pre-detect corners. In order to improve the location accuracy of corners, pseudo response on skewed edges is eliminated. Finally, multiple adjacent responses are tackled by keeping only points which have extremal value of Laplacian. Comparative experiments between FAST and the proposed algorithm are carried out with respect to validity, robustness and efficiency. The results show that the detected corners by the proposed algorithm are accurately located and well-distributed. © 2016 SERSC.",,20162302465358,,"Li, Jia (1); Wang, Jinliang (1); Duan, Ping (1) ","(1) College of Tourism and Geographical Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing,,,,,Edge detection - Signal detection,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Jinliang(wang_jinliang@hotmail.com) ",10.14257/ijsip.2016.9.5.12,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,20054254.0,5.0,2016,English,Algorithms,,16.0,121-134,,2016,Science and Engineering Research Support Society,"International Journal of Signal Processing, Image Processing and Pattern Recognition",,Compass detection algorithm based on image corner,,Adaptive thresholds - Comparative experiments - Corner detection - Detection algorithm - FAST - Image intensities - Location accuracy - Skewed edge,9.0

"Proc. IEEE Inf. Technol., Netw., Electron. Autom. Control Conf., ITNEC","A peak-picking method has been proposed and integrated into baseline AMDFs for pitch detection. Many of the known peak-picking methods for AMDF/ACF based PDAs expect to search the sole peak located at pitch period. However, it is a fact that correct pitch information is also contained in the peaks located at positive integer multiple of pitch period, whose existence are strong evidence of the validity of detected pitch as well. The proposed peak-picking method uses clustering analysis searching these peaks as many as possible. A necessary condition and some constraints are used to select the optimal cluster produced by clustering analysis. The proposed method shows a very good adaptability and noise-robustness. 5 improved AMDFs are employed to evaluate performance of proposed peak-picking method.

J. Agric. Food Chem.,"Exploring novel anticancer agents that can trigger non-apoptotic or non-autophagic cell death is urgent for cancer treatment. In this study, we screened and identified an unexplored anticancer activity of gypenoside L (Gyp-L) isolated from Gynostemma pentaphyllum. We showed that treatment with Gyp-L induces non-apoptotic and non-autophagic cytoplasmic vacuolation death in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Mechanically, Gyp-L initially increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which, in turn, triggered protein ubiquitination and unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in Ca2+release from endoplasm reticulum (ER) inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-operated stores and finally cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death. Interruption of the ROS-ER-Ca2+signaling pathway by chemical inhibitors significantly prevented Gyp-L-induced vacuole formation and cell death. In addition, Gyp-L-induced ER stress and vacuolation death required new protein synthesis. Overall, our works provide strong evidence for the anti-HCC activity of Gyp-L and suggest a novel therapeutic option by Gyp-L through the induction of a unconventional ROS-ER-Ca2+-mediated cytoplasmic vacuolation death in human HCC. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,20161002079113,,"Zheng, Kai (1, 4); Liao, Chenghui (1); Li, Yan (5); Fan, Xinmin (1); Fan, Long (1); Xu, Hong (2); Kang, Qiangrong (1); Zeng, Yong (5); Wu, Xuli (1); Wu, Haiqiang (1); Liu, Lizhong (1); Xiao, Xiaohua (3); Zhang, Jian (1); Wang, Yifei (4); He, Zhendan (1) ","(1) Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen; Guangdong; 518060, China (2) College of Life Sciences, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen; Guangdong; 518060, China (3) First Affiliated Hospital of School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen; Guangdong; 518060, China (4) College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou; Guangdong; 510632, China (5) First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650032, China ",JAFCAU,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 482.2 Minerals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Biosynthesis - Cell death - Gypsum - Oxygen - Proteins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Jian(jzhanghappy@szu.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05668,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205118.0,"Number: 2015A030310529, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 2015A030313558, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Number: 2015M570726, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: ZDSYS201506031617582, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20140418091413497, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: KQCX20140522111508785, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JCYJ20140414170821276, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: CXZZ20150601110000604, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: SFG2013-180, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: CXZZ20150529165110750, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31500285, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31540012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 30570421, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by Grants from the Shenzhen Strategic Emerging Industry Development Project Fund (ZDSYS201506031617582, SFG2013-180, KQCX20140522111508785, CXZZ20150601110000604, JCYJ20140414170821276, JCYJ20140418091413497, and CXZZ20150529165110750), the Natural Micromolecule Drug Innovation Engineering Laboratory Fund [Shenfagai (2013) 180], the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant 2015M570726), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31500285, 31540012, and 30570421), and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2015A030310529 and 2015A030313558).",,218561.0,8.0,"March 2, 2016",English,Cell signaling,,43.0,1702-1711,,2016,American Chemical Society,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,,"Gypenoside L, Isolated from Gynostemma pentaphyllum, Induces Cytoplasmic Vacuolation Death in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells through Reactive-Oxygen-Species-Mediated Unfolded Protein Response",,Calcium release - Gynostemma pentaphyllum - gypenoside L - Hepatocellular carcinoma cell - Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - Reactive oxygen species - Unfolded protein response - vacuolation death,64.0

Biomater. Sci.,"Great progress has been made in the field of vascular tissue engineering, with some artificial vascular grafts already exhibiting promising outcomes in animal models. However, these studies were mostly conducted using healthy animals, which are not representative of actual clinical demands. Indeed, patients who require artificial vascular graft implantation are often accompanied by other comorbidities, such as hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes which should also be taken into consideration when assessing the potential of vascular grafts that are intended for clinical applications. In the present study, we established a rat model with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for performance evaluation of an electrospun PCL vascular graft. Our data showed that rats with T2D had elevated incidents of adverse event rates, including exacerbated platelet adhesion, inflammation, early calcification and impaired regeneration compared to the non-diabetic controls. Thus, we report that T2D exacerbates the regeneration process after in vivo implantation of vascular grafts. More advanced grafts are in demand for clinical use in patients with clinical complications such as T2D. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,20163902852547,,"Wang, Zhihong (1, 2); Zheng, Wenting (2); Wu, Yifan (2); Wang, Jianing (2); Zhang, Xiuyuan (1); Wang, Kai (2); Zhao, Qiang (2); Kong, Deling (1, 2); Ke, Tingyu (3); Li, Chen (1) ","(1) Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterials Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin; 300192, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Chemical Science and Engineering (Tianjin), College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin; 300071, China (3) Department of Endocrinology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650101, China ",,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 462.4 Prosthetics,,,,,Biomineralization - Rats - Tissue engineering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ke, Tingyu(cli0616826@126.com) ",10.1039/c6bm00178e,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20474849.0,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Number: 13JCYBJC39300, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31400833, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31300732, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81260229, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81530059, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) projects (no. 81530059, 31400833, 31300732, 81260229) and Tianjin Research Programme of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology project (no. 13JCYBJC39300).

Renew. Energy,"β-caryophyllene is a common sesquiterpene compound currently being studied as a promising precursor for the production of high-density fuels. Acute demand for high-density fuels has provided the impetus to pursue biosynthetic methods to produce β-caryophyllene from reproducible sources. In this study, we produced β-caryophyllene by assembling a biosynthetic pathway in an engineered Escherichia coli strain of which phosphoglucose isomerase gene has been deleted. The 1- deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) or heterologous mevalonate (MVA) pathways were employed. Meanwhile, geranyl diphosphate synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-caryophyllene synthase genes were co-overexpressed in the above strain. The final genetically modified strain, YJM59, produced 220 ± 6 mg/L of β-caryophyllene in flask culture. We also evaluated the use of fed-batch fermentation for the production of β-caryophyllene. After induction for 60 h, the YJM59 strain produced β-caryophyllene at a concentration of 1520 mg/L. The volumetric production fermented in the aerobic fed-batch was 0.34 mg/(L·h·OD600) and the conversion efficiency of glucose to β-caryophyllene (gram to gram) was 1.69%. Our results are the first successful attempt to produce β-caryophyllene using E. coli BL21(DE3), and provide a new strategy that is green and sustainable for the production of β-caryophyllene. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,20162902608858,,"Yang, Jianming (1); Li, Zhengfeng (2); Guo, Lizhong (1); Du, Juan (1); Bae, Hyeun-Jong (3) ","(1) Key Lab of Applied Mycology, College of Life Sciences, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao; 266109, China (2) Hongta Tobacco (Group) Co.

Huagong Jinzhan/Chem. Ind. Eng. Prog.,"To evaluate the top-blown macromixing time method,hydrodynamic experimental study of top-blown gas stirring was carried out. The RGB color model was used to determine the macromixing time in stirred vessels based on the law of distribution of tracer particles with time evolution. By defining the threshold to separate each pixel,we established the mixed pixel ratio M(%) value as the index to determine the mixing time and observed the change law of M(%) value to determine the mixing time by the method of 3σ. The mixing time is 13.30 seconds when X(the threshold) equals 90% under the first experimental condition of the spray gun's insertion depth 0.5 and the flow rate 1 expressed by nondimensional strength unit. The analysis results showed that the RGB color model can be used to determine the mixing time based on the distribution of tracer particles in the mixing process. The deviation of the mixing time was not more than 10% measured by Betti numbers and electrical conductivity. A new insight was provided to solve the engineering problem such as various multiphase mixed effect and some experimental basis are offered to improve the life span of ISA furnace,strengthen its smelting production and optimize its technological process. © 2016, Chemical Industry Press.
