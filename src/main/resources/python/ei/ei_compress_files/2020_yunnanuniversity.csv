Chemosphere,"The present study proposes the use of endophytic fungi for mercury bioremediation in in vitro and host-associated systems. We examined mercury resistance in 32 strains of endophytic fungi grown in culture medium supplemented with toxic metal concentrations. The residual mercury concentrations were quantified after mycelial growth. Aspergillus sp. A31, Curvularia geniculata P1, Lindgomycetaceae P87, and Westerdykella sp. P71 were selected and further tested for mercury bioremediation and bioaccumulation in vitro, as well as for growth promotion of Aeschynomene fluminensis and Zea mays in the presence or absence of the metal. Aspergillus sp. A31, C. geniculata P1, Lindgomycetaceae P87 and Westerdykella sp. P71 removed up to 100% of mercury from the culture medium in a species-dependent manner and they promoted A. fluminensis and Z. mays growth in substrates containing mercury or not (Dunnett's test, p © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193807456541,124874.0,"Pietro-Souza, William (1); de Campos Pereira, Felipe (2); Mello, Ivani Souza (3); Stachack, Fernando Ferrari Frutuoso (4); Terezo, Ailton Jose (4); Cunha, Cátia Nunes da (2); White, James Francis (5); Li, Haiyan (6); Soares, Marcos Antônio (2) ","(1) Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Mato Grosso, Lucas Do Rio Verde; Mato Grosso, Brazil (2) Department of Botany and Ecology, Laboratory of Biotechnology and Microbial Ecology, Institute of Biosciences, Federal University of Mato Grosso, Cuiabá; Mato Grosso, Brazil (3) Department of Forest Engineering, Federal University of Mato Grosso, Cuiabá; Mato Grosso, Brazil (4) Fuel Analysis Centre (CEANC), Federal University of Mato Grosso, Cuiabá; Mato Grosso, Brazil (5) Department of Plant Biology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick; NJ, United States (6) Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",CMSHAF,454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 461 Bioengineering and Biology - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801.2 Biochemistry,,,,,Aspergillus - Bioaccumulation - Biochemistry - Bioremediation - Biotechnology - Histology - Soil pollution control - Tissue,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Soares, Marcos Antônio(drmasoares@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124874,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18791298.0,"Number: 409062/2018-9, Acronym: CNPq, Sponsor: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e Tecnol&oacute;gico; Number: 568258/2014, Acronym: FAPEMAT, Sponsor: Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o de Amparo &agrave; Pesquisa&nbsp;do Estado de&nbsp;Mato Grosso; ","We thank the Instituto Nacional de &Aacute;reas &Uacute;midas (INAU) for providing the logistic support for field collections, and Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o de Amparo &agrave; Pesquisa do Estado de Mato Grosso (FAPEMAT, grant 568258/2014) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e Tecnol&oacute;gico (CNPq, grant 409062/2018-9) for the financial support.",,00456535,,February 2020,English,Mercury (metal),,75,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Chemosphere,Mercury resistance and bioremediation mediated by endophytic fungi,Curvularia geniculata - Lindgomycetaceae - Mercury concentrations - Mercury resistance - Metal bioaccumulation - Phytoextraction - Resistance mechanisms - Westerdykella,240
Sci. Total Environ.,"In this study, geochemical fractionation is used to establish the relationship between sediment phosphorus (P) pools and anthropogenic activities based on the dated sediment from a suite of lakes in China. Our extraction results showed that the inorganic P fractions, including Ca-P (46% of TP) and Fe/Al-P (24%), constitute most of the P in sediments. Soil erosion dynamics and geographic location are the dominant factors controlling the historical distribution and partitioning of Ca-P in sediments, while over the last few decades, industrial and domestic effluents were the leading factor controlling Fe/Al-P. The organic P (Po) fractions, NaHCO3-Po, HCl-Po, and Ful-Po accounted for only 11%, 16% and 12% of Po on average, respectively, whereas Hum-Po and Res-Po made up the dominant Po fraction (59%) and were the main factors controlling Po dynamics due to fertilizer and livestock breeding. Thus, the historical fraction of P in the sediment core can be used as an indicator of anthropogenic activities. Ca-P decreased in the top layers of the cores because of the implementation of the Soil and Water Conservation Law in China since 1991. However, Fe/Al-P and Po continuously increased in the lakes from the economic backward area over the last few decades, which is largely due to enhanced point sources of pollution and an increase in the intensity of agricultural practices. As a potential P source, the massive accumulation of Fe/Al-P and Po would be released into the overlying water to further facilitate eutrophication via increasing pH and alkaline phosphatase and decreasing in the dissolved oxygen concentration. Therefore, in order to control eutrophication more effectively and efficiently, it is essential that the accumulation of sediment Fe/Al-P and Po be decreased immediately and domestic wastewater, poultry excreta, and fertilizer loss must be more carefully controlled, especially in economically backward areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194507621241,134242.0,"Ni, Zhaokui (1, 2); Wang, Shengrui (1, 3, 4); Wu, Yue (1, 2); Pu, Jia (1) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education on Groundwater Pollution Control and Remediation, College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing; 100875, China (2) Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing; 100012, China (3) China Three Gorges University, College of Hydraulic & Environmental Engineering, Yichang; 443002, China (4) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake- Watershed, Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650034, China ",STEVA8,"444 Water Resources - 452.3 Industrial Wastes - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control",,,,,Agriculture - Alkalinity - Calcium compounds - Dissolved oxygen - Effluents - Eutrophication - Fertilizers - Iron compounds - Lakes - Phosphatases - Phosphorus - Sodium bicarbonate - Soil conservation - Water conservation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shengrui(wangsr@bnu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134242,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18791026.0,"Number: B18006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project; Number: 312232102, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018YFD0900805, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research; Number: 230200069, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Open-End Fund for the Valuable and Precision Instruments of Central South University; ","This research was jointly supported by the National High&ndash;level Personnel of Special Support Program (People Plan, grant number 312232102 ), the National Key Research & Development Program of China ( 2018YFD0900805 ), the 111 Project ( B18006 ), and the Open-End fund of the Kunming China International Research Center for Plateau&ndash;Lake (grant number 230200069 ).",,00489697,,10 January 2020,English,Sediments,,65,,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Science of the Total Environment,Response of phosphorus fractionation in lake sediments to anthropogenic activities in China,Agricultural practices - Anthropogenic activity - Dissolved oxygen concentrations - Geochemical fractionations - Phosphorus fractionation - Sediment core - Soil and water conservation - Soil erosion dynamics,699

Appl. Math. Model.,"Magnetic energy release conversion, plasma heating and charged particle energization-acceleration in the magnetic fluctuation-induced self-generating-organization region and the plasma turbulence-induced self-feeding-sustaining region are key issues for large temporal-spatial scale turbulent magnetic reconnection (LTSTMR; observed current sheet thickness to characteristic electron length, electron Larmor radius for low-β and electron inertial length for high-β, ratios on the order of 1010∼1011; observed evolution time to electron cyclotron time ratios on the order of 1010∼1011) that ranges from Earth's magnetosphere to solar eruptions and other astrophysical phenomena. As the first part of a two-paper series, this paper introduces a relativistic hybrid particle-in-cell and lattice Boltzmann (RHPIC-LBM) model that describes the continuous kinetic-dynamic-hydro fully coupled LTSTMR evolution process. First, based on the governing equations of resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the relativistic discrete distribution functions for a magnetic field (D3Q7), electric field (D3Q13), electromagnetic field (D3Q13), charged particle (D3Q19) and neutral particle (D3Q27) of different plasma species are obtained for the RHPIC-LBM lattice grid. Then, the numerical process, algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart and GPU-CPU heterogenous framework of the RHPIC-LBM are described. Finally, this model is tested and validated on Tianhe-2 from the National Supercomputer Center in Guang Zhou (NSCC-GZ) with 10,000 ∼ 100,000 CPU cores and 50∼120 hours per case. We investigate the solar atmosphere LTSTMR activities, including the picoscale (10−2 m ∼105 m), nanoscale (105 m ∼106 m), microscale (106 m ∼107 m), macroscale (107 m ∼108 m) and large hydroscale (108 m ∼109 m). All the simulation results are consistent with observations and theories. The validated model is applied to explore the turbulence evolution of the interactions of the magnetic helical structures in the 3D LTSTMR self-generating-organization magnetic field region and self-feeding-sustaining plasma region in Part II. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",20194807748765,,"Zhu, Bojing (1, 2); Yan, Hui (3); Zhong, Ying (3); Chen, Jingkun (3); Du, Yunfei (3); Cheng, Huihong (4, 5); Yuen, David A.

Chem. Eng. J.,"Organic phase change materials are flammable, which limits their applications in heat storage and conversion. In the presented study, a phosphorus-grafted hexadecanol was blended with pentaerythritol phosphate (PEPA) to prepare flame-retardant phase change material (FRPCM). The thermal properties of FRPCM were evaluated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimetry. The flame-retardant mechanism was examined by thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests. The FRPCM maintains a promising heat storage capacity (186.9 J/g) and thermal stability after grafting and blending. The flame retardance analysis reveals that the grafted phosphorus group helps to promote char formation. PEPA extends the time before exposed combustible material ignites. The cone calorimeter test demonstrated that the peak heat release rate and total heat release are further decreased by more than 50%, owing to the synergistic effect between the phosphorus group and PEPA. The SEM results showed that a porous structure is formed during combustion. Self-extinguishment testing indicates that the FRPCM is extinguished in a much shorter time than is hexadecanol. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193407347568,122500.0,"Chen, Renjie (1, 3, 4, 5); Huang, X.

Astron. Comput.,"Anisotropic thermal conduction plays an important role in determining the structure of the hot plasma in the solar corona. When hot plasma appears, the conductivity rises with temperature and becomes highly nonlinear. Explicit solvers for parabolic problems often lead to much smaller time-steps limited by a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition in comparison with hyperbolic Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. In this work, we present a pseudo-linear, directionally-split, semi-implicit method allowing for large time-steps as well as the optimized parallelization algorithm, integrated with the MHD solver. Our scheme can perfectly preserve the monotonicity and the geometry of shocks and discontinuities in complex MHD problems. Two sets of numerical tests show that an increase in time step of ∼600 can be easily achieved with an acceptable error by our scheme compared to explicit methods, and the use of large time-steps can still follow fast dynamic processes reliably. In addition, the extendibility studies have proven that the associated parallel efficiency is comparably high. This method is also useful for any kind of time-dependent conductivity problems for the solar applications in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194407613208,100341.0,"Ye, J. (1, 2); Shen, C.

Chem. Eng. J.,"In this study, platelet membrane (PLTM) biomimetic hollow MnO2 nanoparticles were prepared and these were investigated for delivery of bufalin. Additionally, these nanoparticles, in response to the tumor microenvironment, showed rapid drug release and generated the hydroxyl radicals (HO[rad]) by the Fenton reaction between Mn2+ and endogenous H2O2 for use in MRI-guided anti-tumor activity. Firstly, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were used to reduce KMnO4 to HMnO2 nanoparticles followed by acetone etching. After bufalin loading, these NPs were biomimetically cloaked with PLTM to form PLTM-HMnO2@Bu NPs. In vitro release profiles showed that the NPs responded to acid pH and glutathione (GSH) to induce decomposition of MnO2, resulting in rapid release of bufalin and yielding the MRI contrast agent Mn2+. In vivo MRI studies revealed an obvious T1 contrast enhancement at the tumor site because of a combination of the EPR and active targeting effects. The PLTM-HMnO2 NPs led to effective inhibition of tumor growth, attributing to Fenton-like Mn2+ conversion of endogenous H2O2 in the tumor to highly toxic HO[rad] and this anti-tumor efficacy was enhanced when combined with chemotherapy. These results indicate that the PLTM biomimetic HMnO2 nanoparticles are promising drug delivery systems for MRI-monitoring and enhanced targeted treatment of tumors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194107505975,122848.0,"Wang, Haijun (1); Bremner, David H.

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"Interval-censored failure time data often occur in many areas and their analysis has recently attracted a great deal of attention. On the other hand, most of the existing literature for them can only deal with time-independent covariates. Sometimes one may face time dependent covariates and furthermore the covariates could also suffer measurement errors. For the situation, one approach is to conduct a joint analysis for which many methods have been developed in the literature under various framework. One drawback of these methods is that they usually assume that there are no more measurements on the covariates after the failure time and it is apparent that this may not be true. In this paper, a new joint analysis approach is proposed that can take into account the extra observations. In particular, for estimation, a MCEM algorithm is developed that is much more stable and converges much faster than the existing algorithms. To assess the finite sample performance of the proposed method, an extensive simulation study is conducted and suggests that it works well for practical situations. Also the method is applied to an AIDS study that motivated this investigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194207549747,106848.0,"Yi, Fengting (1); Tang, Niansheng (1); Sun, Jianguo (2) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Statistical Modeling and Data Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Statistics, University of Missouri, Columbia; MO; 65211, United States ",CSDADW,922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Regression analysis - Sampling,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Sun, Jianguo(sunj@missouri.edu) ",10.1016/j.csda.2019.106848,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 11671349, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors wish to thank Professor Ana Colubi, Co-Editor-in-Chief, the Associate Editor and two reviewers for their many helpful and insightful comments and suggestions that greatly improved the paper.

Signal Process,"Person re-identification (PRID) refers to a technology of matching person across non-overlapping camera views. Metric learning is one of the most commonly used methods in PRID. However, most of them do not explore the label information carried by the labeled training samples, which limits the improvement of recognition performance. To this end, we propose a joint learning method by integrating the discriminative metric learning, the support vector machine (SVM) and the identity discriminator into one model, so as to realize joint construction of metric learning and identity discriminator. In this process, the label information carried by the training samples is fully exploited and the latent identify space of pedestrians is constructed by predicting the person's identity. To mitigate the appearance ambiguity caused by the variations in camera views, body poses, illumination and occlusion, we develop an extreme distance regularization term and introduce it into the joint learning framework to refine the solution spaces of the metric learning and discriminator. Finally, we present a similarity measure method by combining the advantages of the metric learning and the identity discriminator. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods. © 2019",20193707417396,107277.0,"Zhao, Dandan (1, 2); Wang, Hongbin (2); Yin, Hongpeng (1); Yu, Zhengtao (2); Li, Huafeng (2) ","(1) School of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 40044, China (2) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",SPRODR,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 742.2 Photographic Equipment",,,,,Cameras - Sampling,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Hongbin(whbin2007@126.com) ",10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.107277,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2016FB105, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FB109, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016FD039, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017FB094, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 61302041, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61562053, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61563025, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61966020, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61966021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: KKSY201403020, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: KKSY201403116, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: KKSY201503063, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant (61966021, 61966020, 61562053, 61302041, 61563025), the Yunnan Natural Science Funds under grant (2016FB105, 2017FB094, 2016FD039, 2016FB109), the Project of Innovative Research Team of Yunnan Province, and Kunming University of Science and Technology to introduce talent fund (KKSY201403116, KKSY201503063, KKSY201403020).",,01651684,,January 2020,English,Support vector machines,,78,,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Signal Processing,Person re-identification by integrating metric learning and support vector machine,Benchmark datasets - Distance regularizations - Latent identity - Metric learning - Non-overlapping camera views - Person re identifications - Similarity measure - State-of-the-art methods,166
J. Catal.,"As a promising alternative to the Haber–Bosch process for producing NH3, the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in the aqueous electrolyte has attracted much attention. However, the presence of sluggish reaction kinetics and competitive hydrogen evolution could result in poor activity and unsatisfactory selectivity. Herein, self-supported NbSe2 nanosheet arrays have been prepared and tested as electrocatalysts for NH3 electrosynthesis with a Faradaic efficiency of 13.9 ± 1.0% at −0.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) and a yield rate of 89.5 ± 6.0 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.45 V vs RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 under ambient conditions. Moreover, this electrocatalyst showed excellent durability during the 60-h electrolysis (no stable decay of Faradaic efficiencies and NH3 yield rates). Furthermore, density functional theory calculations disclosed that NbSe2 can effectively catalyze the dissociation of the adsorbed N2 molecule and thus promote the NRR process. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",20194607681437,,"Wang, Yong (1); Chen, Anran (1); Lai, Shuhua (2); Peng, Xianyun (2); Zhao, Shunzheng (3); Hu, Guangzhi (1); Qiu, Yuan (2); Ren, Junqiang (4); Liu, Xijun (2); Luo, Jun (2) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, School of Energy, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Center for Electron Microscopy and Tianjin Key Lab of Advanced Functional Porous Materials, Institute for New Energy Materials and Low-Carbon Technologies, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin; 300384, China (3) Department of Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing; 100083, China (4) State Key Laboratory of Advanced Processing and Recycling of Nonferrous Metals, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou; 730050, China ",JCTLA5,761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering - 922.1 Probability Theory - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Ammonia - Density functional theory - Efficiency - Electrocatalysts - Electrolytes - Electrolytic reduction - Hydrogen - Nanosheets - Reaction kinetics - Selenium compounds - Sodium sulfate,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hu, Guangzhi(guangzhihu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jcat.2019.10.029,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10902694.0,"Number: 2017YFA0700104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51761165012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by National Key R&D Program of China ( 2017YFA0700104 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21603161 , 21677171 and 51761165012 ).

Sep. Purif. Technol.,"Cadmium telluride waste contains a portion of rare metals. In this paper, a new, clean and efficient vulcanization-vacuum distillation process is used to separate the rare metal Te from cadmium telluride. Taking CdTe (99.99%) and S (99.99%) as examples, the feasibility of this process was verified on a laboratory scale. Recovery of cadmium telluride waste was simplified to two-step vulcanization and vacuum distillation process. The effects of temperature and time on vulcanization-vacuum distillation were investigated. The experimental results show that the purity of Te obtained by vacuum distillation was 99.92%, and the purity of cadmium sulfide was up to 99.5%. This method provides theoretical guidance for the recycling of cadmium telluride photovoltaic modules. Compared with the traditional methods, this process has a short refining process, does no generate waste water or waste gas, and is environmentally friendly. The Te and CdS obtained from vulcanization-vacuum distillation can be utilized as raw materials for semiconductor production after subsequent processing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193107259385,115864.0,"Zhang, Xiaofeng (1, 2, 3); Huang, Daxin (1, 2, 3); Jiang, Wenlong (1, 2, 3); Zha, Guozheng (1, 2, 3); Deng, Juhai (1, 2, 3); Deng, Pan (1, 2, 3); Kong, Xiangfeng (1, 2, 3); Liu, Dachun (1, 2, 3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clear Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory for Nonferrous Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",SPUTFP,"452.3 Industrial Wastes - 513.1 Petroleum Refining, General - 633.1 Vacuum Applications - 712.1.1 Single Element Semiconducting Materials - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 818.1 Natural Rubber - 818.3 Rubber and Elastomer Processing",,,,,Cadmium sulfide - Distillation - II-VI semiconductors - Metal recovery - Petroleum refining - Photovoltaic cells - Recycling - Rubber - Semiconducting tellurium - Sulfur compounds - Vacuum applications - Vulcanization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Dachun(2502395170@qq.com) ",10.1016/j.seppur.2019.115864,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18733794.0,"Number: 2014HA003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Cultivating Plan Program for the Leader in Science and Technology of Yunnan Province; Number: 2016YFC0400404, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2017FB082, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; Number: 2014RA4018, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Program for Nonferrous Metals Vacuum Metallurgy Innovation Team of Ministry of Science and Technology; Number: 2017YJS066, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Scientific Research Foundation of Hunan Provincial Education Department; Number: KKZ3201552016, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: CNMRCUTS1605, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1502271, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work has been founded by the Fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers U1502271 ], the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant numbers 2016YFC0400404 ], the Cultivating Plan Program for the Leader in Science and Technology of Yunnan Province [grant numbers 2014HA003 ], the Program for Nonferrous Metals Vacuum Metallurgy Innovation Team of Ministry of Science and Technology [grant numbers 2014RA4018 ], Postgraduate project of scientific research foundation of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education [grant numbers 2017YJS066 ], Personal Training Project of Kunming University of Science and Technology [grant numbers KKZ3201552016 ], Personal Training Project of State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization [grant numbers CNMRCUTS1605 ], Science and technology planning project of Yunnan Province [grant numbers 2017FB082 ].

Lect. Notes Electr. Eng.,"Images are possibly degraded by various reasons, the typical forms of degradation are: blur, noise, low resolution, and etc. Image restoration techniques try to recover the degraded images to the original images with maximum fidelity. Image restoration is a challenging task and also an import research area in image processing. During the decades, researchers have proposed many restoration methods such as inverse filter, Weiner filter, wavelet analysis, support vector machine, and etc. Recently, deep learning has been increasingly popular among researchers and has obtained remarkable results. In this paper, we briefly review the approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image restoration. The typical GANs based restoration methods for image super-resolution, image denoising, image inpainting and image deblurring are introduced and discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",20193707412874,,"Zhang, Cai (1); Du, Fei (1); Zhang, Yungang (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",230699.0,"April 24, 2019 - April 26, 2019","Xian, China","13th International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, MUE 2019 and 14th International Conference on Future Information Technology, Future Tech 2019",Deep learning - Deep neural networks - Image denoising - Image enhancement - Inverse problems - Neural networks - Restoration - Support vector machines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yungang(yungang.zhang01@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-981-32-9244-4_24,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),18761119.0,,,9789813292437.0,18761100,,2020,English,Image reconstruction,Advanced Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering - MUE/FutureTech 2019,25,169-175,1 of 1,2020,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,A Brief Review of Image Restoration Techniques Based on Generative Adversarial Models,Adversarial networks - Degraded images - Image deblurring - Image Inpainting - Image restoration techniques - Image super resolutions - Original images - Restoration methods,590
Lect. Notes Electr. Eng.,"This paper considers the task of learning utility functions of certain influence diagram based on the decision maker’s past decisions. We assume that the influence diagram structure and the probability distribution it assigns to random events are known, so that we need only infer the utility function u for its. We also assume that the decision maker is rational. In particular, the decision maker’s past decisions can be viewed as constraints on u. So, if we have a prior probability distribution p(u) over u, we can then condition on these constraints to obtain u. In this paper, an approach for learning utility functions from decision maker’s behavior was proposed. We also show that it is effective. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",20193707412868,,"Lei, Bai (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,912.2 Management - 922.1 Probability Theory,230699.0,"April 24, 2019 - April 26, 2019","Xian, China","13th International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, MUE 2019 and 14th International Conference on Future Information Technology, Future Tech 2019",Probability distributions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lei, Bai(baileix@163.com) ",10.1007/978-981-32-9244-4_23,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),18761119.0,,,9789813292437.0,18761100,,2020,English,Decision making,Advanced Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering - MUE/FutureTech 2019,9,164-168,1 of 1,2020,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,Learning Influence Diagram Utility Function by Observing Behavior,Decision makers - Influence diagram - Observing behavior - Utility functions,590
Adv. Intell. Sys. Comput.,"Dongba hieroglyph is a kind of very primitive picture hieroglyphs; they express meaning by using pictures. This makes the same type words have some similarities in morphology and structure, and they are distinguished only by local differences. In this paper, we analyse the basic structural of the single graphemes in Dongba hieroglyphs. By analysing the writing methods and habits, we give a local feature curve extraction algorithm for Dongba Hieroglyphs based on CDPM (Connected Domain Priority Marking Algorithm) and DCE (Discrete Curve Evolution Algorithm). The algorithm can extract local feature curves which can contain one or more glyphic features, and it can also combine redundant curves based on template curves to facilitate the comparison between the local curves and template. Extracting the local feature curves of Dongba hieroglyph is helpful to analysis the local similarities in different hieroglyphs, classify and retrieve hieroglyph.

Sustainable Cities Soc.,"This study investigated the travel characteristics and influential factors of travel mode choice for healthcare activity by the elderly in core area and suburb. The results of descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic models show that: (1) Bus and walking are main modes for the elderly to seek medical treatment. The elderly in suburb travel longer distance and are more dependent on bus than those in core area. (2) The service efficiency improvements of hospitals could promote the elderly in core area to choose green modes, while those in suburb are more likely to utilize cars to obtain high-quality medical resources. (3) For long-distance travel, the influence of family economic backgrounds on the mode choice is more significant in suburb, and the difference of family economic will further aggravate the internal differentiation in long-distance travel among the elderly in suburb. (4) Interestingly, the elderly in core area tend to utilize cars to seek for healthcare when they live with their offspring, while those in suburb tend to use cars and taxis when they have serious illness and require companion. Finally, relevant policies and suggestions were proposed to improve the accessibility and fairness of healthcare travel for the elderly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20194107509846,101868.0,"Du, Mingyang (1); Cheng, Lin (1); Li, Xuefeng (1); Yang, Jingzong (2) ","(1) School of Transportation, Southeast University, Nanjing; Jiangsu; 211189, China (2) School of Information, Baoshan University, Baoshan; Yunnan; 678000, China ",,461.7 Health Care,,,,,,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cheng, Lin(gist@seu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.scs.2019.101868,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51578150, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51578150).

Mater.,"Nanoparticles film of copper metal hexacyanoferrates (CuHCF) was fabricated to electrochemically separate Co2+ in aqueous solutions under various conditions such as applied potential, solution pHs, initial concentrations, contact time and coexisting ions. Results showed that the removal efficiency conducted in reduction potential was obviously higher than that in oxidation potential. The optimal pH for Co2+ adsorption occurred at 8.0. Coexisting ions studies revealed that Co2+ could be removed from aqueous solutions containing Li+, Cu2+ and Al3+. Considering that cobalt and lithium are the main metallic elements in LiCoO2, the effect of different ionic strengths (IS) of LiNO3 (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10) on adsorption was further investigated. Results showed that IS of LiNO3 had little impact on the removal efficiency of Co2+, which indicated the potential of selective recovery of cobalt from LiCoO2 in spent lithium-ion batteries. X-ray energy-dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed that the Co2+ could be adsorbed effectively onto CuHCF film. The adsorption was well described by Langmuir isotherm and the maximum sorption capacity is 218.82 mg/g. The kinetic rate of Co2+ adsorption was rapid initially and attained equilibrium within 60 min, and the data well fitted the Redlich-Peterson and the Elovich model, implying a chemisorption dominated process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194007485957,121252.0,"Long, Xinxin (1); Chen, Rongzhi (1); Tan, Jihua (1); Lu, Yifeng (2); Wang, Jixiang (1); Huang, Tijun (2); Lei, Qin (1) ","(1) College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yuquan Road 19A, Beijing; 100049, China (2) School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University, East Outer Ring Road, Kunming; 650500, China ",JHMAD9,544.1 Copper - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Cobalt - Copper - Copper compounds - Ionic strength - Ions - Isotherms - Lithium compounds - Lithium-ion batteries - Metal nanoparticles,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Rongzhi(crz0718@ucas.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121252,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18733336.0,"Number: 2017B030314057, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Provincial Applied Science and Technology Research and Development Program; Number: 2184128, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; Number: 21806166, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Authors acknowledge the research staffs in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences to provide technical assistance on FE-SEM, XRD, FTIR, EDS and XPS test and analysis.

Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"Traditional Chinese medicine Panax notoginseng is a valuable geo-authentic herbal material. The difference of growth environment in different producing areas has significant influence on the quality of traditional Chinese medicine, and origin identification is an important part of the quality assessment of P. notoginseng. In this study, Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) and near infrared (NIR) sensor technologies combined with single spectra analysis and multi-sensor information fusion strategy (low-, mid- and high-level) for the origin identification of 210 P. notoginseng samples from five cities in Yunnan Province, China. FT-MIR spectra were considered to play a greater role in data analysis than NIR spectra. Random forest (RF) was used to establish classification models. The result of the random forest Boruta (RF-Bo) model and the random forest variable selection (RF-Vs) model based on high-level multi-sensor information fusion strategy was satisfactory. In addition, the RF-Bo model based on high-level multi-sensor information fusion strategy was faster and simpler in data analysis and the accuracy was 95.6%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194107517988,117619.0,"Zhou, Yuhou (1); Zuo, Zhitian (2); Xu, Furong (1); Wang, Yuanzhong (2) ","(1) College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming; 650200, China ",SAMCAS,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Data handling - Decision trees - Information analysis - Information fusion - Infrared devices - Medicine - Sensors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Furong(xfrong99@163.com) ",10.1016/j.saa.2019.117619,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2018FF001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",This work was sponsored by Yunnan Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Joint Project (Grant Number: 2018FF001 (&minus;004) ).

Ceram Int,"In this work, perovskite manganites, La0.7(Ag0.3-xNax)0.3MnO3 (LANMO, x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2), were synthesized using facile sol-gel method. Structural, electrical, and magnetoresistive (MR) properties of LANMO samples with different sodium contents were investigated. XRD and Rietveld refinement revealed that all samples crystallized in distorted rhombohedral system with R3‾c space group. The doping of sodium increased average particle sizes and A-site cation vacancies and also reduced formal charges of Mn. Electrical transport properties showed that peaks for temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and corresponding temperatures (Tk) improved significantly due to increased Na content. TCR and MR values of 10.4% K−1 and 24.5% for x = 0.1 were obtained at room temperature (297.1 and 299.2 K, respectively).

Soil Tillage Res.,"China is the top potato producing country in the world, and Yunnan Province (in Southwest China) makes a significant contribution (10.1 %) to the total production. The uneven rainfall distribution causes seasonal spring drought in the region. To resolve this issue, we evaluated the effects of cultivation modes on the soil temperature, soil water content, and potato yield. Four cultivation modes were evaluated: A1, flat-planting at sowing, double ridges after emergence; A2, double ridges in plastic film covered with soil, potato planted along the larger ridge side; A3, double ridges in plastic film mulching covered in soil; and A4-control (CK), double ridges, consisting of two different plastic film covering modes (A2, A3) and two covering modes without a plastic film (A1, A4). The field experiments were conducted for three years (2014, 2015, and 2016) in three regions (S1, S2, and S3) of Yunnan in southwestern China. The results showed that the effects of cultivation patterns on the soil temperature and humidity were not the same in the three ecological regions. Before mound closure, compared to the CK treatment, higher soil temperature was observed at the S1 and S2 regions using the A3 mode, which was 5.15 °C and 3.4 °C, respectively. The soil moisture was 4 % (S1), 50.8 % (S2), and 10.0 % (S3) higher with the A2 mode than under the CK mode in the three ecological zones, but the soil moisture was 27.1 % lower with the A3 mode than that with the CK mode at S2. Multiple regression analysis revealed the optimum surface soil temperature (18.9–20.8 °C) and water content (58.6 %–70.4 %) for seedling emergence and potato tuber yield. The emergence, tuber growth, and yield were mainly related to the soil temperature and soil water content at S1 and S2, respectively, while at S3, both factors contributed significantly. Overall yield differed significantly at the cultivation sites, but the average yield was similar in each year at each site. The highest stable potato yield occurred with the A3 mode at S1, and with the A2 mode at S2 and S3. Our research provides suitable methods for potato production in different rain-fed and seasonally arid areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194707719347,104502.0,"Liang, Shu-Min (1); Li, Yan-Shan (1); Rashid, Muhammad Abdul Rehman (1, 4); He, Sheng-Ding (2); Wang, Peng-Jun (3); Yin, Zi-You (1); Lu, Li-Li (1); Zhan, Kang (3); Wang, Shao-Lin (2); Wang, Xing-Ting (3); Zhao, Zhi-Jian (1); Yang, Qun-Qing (2); He, Ping-Gen (2); Bai, Jian-Ming (1); Xu, Fa-Hai (3); Ren, Cai (5); Jiang, Wei (1); Li, Xian-Ping (1); Sui, Qi-Jun (1); Yang, Qiong-Fen (1) ","(1) Industrial Crops Research Institute/Potato Engineering Technology Research Center of Yunnan, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming; Yunnan; 650200, China (2) Lijiang Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Lijiang; Yunnan; 674100, China (3) Potato Seeds Research and Development Center, Agricultural Technology Extension Center of Xuan-wei, Xuan-wei; Yunnan; 655400, China (4) University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Sub-campus Burewala, 61010, Pakistan (5) College of Grassland and Environment Sciences, Xinjiang Agricultural University, Xinjiang; Urumqi; 830052, China ",SOTRD5,443 Meteorology - 443.3 Precipitation - 444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 817.1 Polymer Products - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Arid regions - Drought - Ecology - Plastic films - Rain - Regression analysis - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Xian-Ping(lxianping@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.still.2019.104502,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,"This study was supported by major project of new product development of Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department, Yunnan, China (2013BB005); Special project for Applied Basic Research Programs of Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China (YJM201708); National Science & Technology Pillar Program of Ministry of Science and Technology, People's Republic of China during the Twelfth Five-year Plan Period (2012BAD06B00); Cultivating and introducing of high-level scientific and technological talents project of Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department, Yunnan, China (2011CL133).",,01671987,,March 2020,English,Soil moisture,,37,,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Soil and Tillage Research,Effects of planting patterns on rainwater use efficiency and potato tuber yield in seasonally arid areas of southwestern China,Plastic mulching - Potato - Seasonal droughts - Soil temperature - Yields,197

Chaos Solitons Fractals,"Cooperation is a ubiquitous trait among individuals of a species which interbreeds in nature and forms part of groups [1]. Various theories and models have been developed to explain the origins, maintenance, and continuation of cooperation within a generic population. Among these theories is the prisoner's dilemma (PD), which is a well-known framework for investigations on agents’ behavior and strategies [2]. In a traditional PD game, pairwise players are assigned the same initial endowment, and they have no access to (nor knowledge of) the opponents’ wealth throughout the course of the game. In real life, however, circumstances operate which (in most of the cases) unequally, asymmetrically or hierarchically distribute the income and resources, and the group members may be aware (completely or partially) of their opponents’ power and capacity before making their own decision to cooperate or defect. We experimentally reveal the impact of inequality and visibility by means of comparing the results of four sessions where players (1) may have equal or unequal initial endowments and (2) may be visible or invisible to opponents as far as their wealth information is concerned. Our observations disclose that wealth information makes no significant difference to the promotion of cooperation when the initial wealth distribution is fair. In the case of initially unequal endowments, hiding the payoff information enhances the frequency of cooperation while visibility of the opponent's wealth harms group synergy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193707435188,109398.0,"Zhang, Mi (1); Ma, Yongjuan (2); Tao, Yi (3); Wang, Zhen (4); Shi, Lei (2); Wang, Rui-Wu (1) ","(1) Center for Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an; 710072, China (2) Statistics and Mathematics College, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (3) Key Laboratory of Animal Ecology and Conservation Biology, Centre for Computational Biology and Evolution, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China (4) Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning (OPTIMAL), Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an; 710072, China ",CSFOEH,741.2 Vision,,,,,Mathematical techniques,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shi, Lei(shi_lei65@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109398,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 31270433, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1302267, Acronym: IUSS, Sponsor: National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",We are grateful to the support from the NSFC-Yunnan United fund [grant number U1302267]; the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [grant number 31325005]; and the National Natural Science Foundation of China grants [grant number 31270433].

Mater Sci Semicond Process,"The influence of synthesis conditions on the formation of α and β polymorphs of AgVO3, their crystalline, structural, textual and optical properties and photocatalytic activity for dye degradation was investigated. The as-prepared polymorphs were characterized by using XRD, FTIR, EDX, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, BET and UV–vis. analyses. The analytical results indicated that a metastable α-AgVO3 was formed in the precipitation method, whereas it was irreversibly converted into thermodynamically stable β-AgVO3 by a hydrothermal method at 120 °C. The hydrothermal treatment was found to be decisive for the formation of β-form with high crystallinity and phase purity. The increase of hydrothermal temperature to 150 °C and 180 °C could not contributed to a significant variation in the crystalline, structural, textural and optical properties of the β-AgVO3. Moreover, a plausible mechanism for the phase transformation was briefly discussed. A combination of the needle and rod-like nanostructures of α form was completely changed to nanorods in β form after hydrothermal treatment. The optical band gap of α and β AgVO3 polymorphs was found to be 1.91 eV and 1.98 eV respectively. The photocatalytic activity of the silver vanadates for the degradation of Rhodamine B indicated that β-AgVO3 nanorods were better than α-AgVO3 polymorphs. This could be attributed to the significant effects of its stable crystalline structure rather than specific surface area. Moreover, due to the reduced grain boundaries in β-form, their electron-hole recombination rate was lowed compared to α form. The degradation efficiency reached to 56% within 180 min under visible light irradiation. However, the increase of hydrothermal temperature does not have a significant effect in the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the β-AgVO3 nanorods were successfully reused for five cycles of photodegradation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20194607670861,104824.0,"Pudukudy, Manoj (1); Jia, Qingming (1); Wang, Hong (1); Shan, Shaoyun (1); Rajendran, Ramesh (2) ","(1) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Department of Physics, Periyar University, Salem; Tamilnadu; 636011, India ",,408 Structural Design - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Chromium compounds - Crystalline materials - Crystallinity - Degradation - Energy gap - Grain boundaries - Nanorods - Optical properties - Phase transitions - Photodegradation - Precipitation (chemical) - Reusability - Silver compounds - Structural properties,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pudukudy, Manoj(manojpudukudy@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.mssp.2019.104824,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2019M653845XB, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 10988880, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 21766016, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2019M653845XB ), Postdoctoral Research Funding of Kunming University of Science and Technology (Grant No. 10988880 ) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21566014 and 21766016 ).

Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"A blue emission glutathione stabilized Au nanoclusters prepared by an Au/Histidine complex with ligand-exchanges method was used for sensing of copper ions. We found that the glutathione stabilized Au NCs which has fluorescence emission hundred times higher than the Au/Histidine complex and has a highly selective fluorescence quenching response to copper ion. Other common metal ions, such as mercury, lead, iron and zinc, which could obviously quench or enhance the fluorescence of Au/Histidine complex, do not interfere the sensing of copper using glutathione stabilized Au nanocluster. The possible quenching mechanism and the dynamic quenching process for copper detection were also discussed. The results indicated that copper in the range from 0.5 to 300.0 μM could be linearly detected and the detection could be finished quickly in 5 min.

Pattern Recogn.,"Wearable/portable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the long-term end use are a focus of recent BCI research. A challenge is how to update the BCI to meet changes in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, since the resource are so limited that retraining of traditional well-performed models, such as a support vector machine, is nearly impossible. To cope with this challenge, less-demanding adaptive online learning can be considered. We investigated an adaptive projected sub-gradient method (APSM) that is originated from the set theoretic estimation formulation and the projections onto convex sets theory. APSM provides a unifying framework for both adaptive classification and regression tasks. Coefficients of APSM are adjusted online as data arrive sequentially, with a regularization constraint made by projections onto a fixed closed ball. We extended the general APSM to a shrinkage form, where shrinkage closed balls were used instead of the original fixed one, expecting a more controllable fading effect and better adaptability. The convergence of shrinkage APSM was proved. It was also demonstrated that as shrinkage factor approached to 1, the limit point of shrinkage APSM would approach to the optimal solution with the least norm, which could be especially beneficial for generalization of the classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated, and compared with those of the general APSM, the incremental support vector machine, and the passive aggressive algorithm, through an event-related potential-based BCI experiment. Results showed the advantage of the proposed method over the others on both the online classification performance and the easiness of tuning.

Microporous Mesoporous Mater.,"A series of Fe–Ti-Ox catalysts calcined at different temperatures (signed as Fe–Ti-x, and x symbolized the calcination temperature of 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C, respectively) were prepared and studied for the catalytic hydrolysis of HCN in the presence of H2O. The results implied that Fe–Ti-4 (the calcination temperature was 400 °C) showed the best catalytic hydrolysis efficiency of HCN and the abundant productions (CO and NH3). With the calcination temperature increasing, the catalytic hydrolysis of HCN activity decreased dramatically, which was related to the reduction of specific surface areas and redox property, the formation of rutile TiO2 and decline in quantity of Fe2+ species. Besides, Fe–Ti-Ox catalysts with amorphous states of TiO2 could enhance catalytic hydrolysis of HCN, which depended on the effect of calcination temperature during the preparation process of Fe–Ti-Ox catalysts. © 2019",20193907467910,109753.0,"Song, Zhongxian (1); Huang, Zhenzhen (1); Liu, Biao (1); Liu, Hongpan (2); Zhu, Xinfeng (1); Xia, Futing (3); Kang, Haiyan (1); Mao, Yanli (1); Liu, Xueping (1); Zhao, Baolin (1); Zhang, Qiulin (4) ","(1) Henan University of Urban Construction, Henan Province Key Laboratory of Water Pollution Control and Rehabilitation Technology, Pingdingshan; 467000, China (2) College of Materials and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences.

J Mater Process Technol,"Microstructure and mechanical properties of high-pressure die-cast (HPDC) copper were investigated. The microstructure of the casting changed from surface to center due to the difference of the cooling rate. The as-cast microstructure comprised primary α-Cu grains and [Cu + Cu2O] eutectics. The primary α-Cu grains exhibited three types of morphologies including equiaxed, dendritic, and columnar. The mechanical properties of the casting were significantly influenced by the microstructure of the surface layer. The casting exhibited an ultimate tensile strength of 234 MPa (highest) when the skin layer comprised fine columnar dendrites, together with a yield strength of 87 MPa, and an elongation level of 25.4%. The samples exhibited an excellent elongation of ∼56% with a skin of developed columnar grains. The difference of the skin layer was found mainly caused by the variation of the initial die temperature in HPDC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193707422501,116377.0,"Yang, H.M. (1, 2, 3); Guo, Z.

Int J Approximate Reasoning,"Granule description has become one of the hot research topics in granular computing (GrC). Rough set theory (RST), as an important research technique for granular computing, can describe any target granule (any subset of a universe of discourse) by the lower and upper approximations. But, there is no measure to evaluate the quality of granule description in RST. Moreover, one can acquire different granule descriptions by decomposing a multi-scale information table into different single-scale information tables. Then, it is important to find the most appropriate single-scale information table for meeting specific granule description accuracy requirement. Inspired by the above problem, this paper is to discuss optimal granule level selection based on the granule description accuracy. First of all, a new granule description accuracy is defined by combining GrC and RST. After that, optimal granule level selection is investigated in a multi-scale information table subject to preserving granule description accuracies for a target granule and a group of target granules, respectively. Specially, for the case of a group of target granules, we put forward optimal granule level selection methods based on three different criteria, commonly used by people in daily life. In addition, considering that the data in real-life will be updated as time goes by, we discuss the impact on the optimal granule level when new objects are added gradually. Finally, the time complexity of the proposed algorithms is analyzed, the reasonability of setting the parameters is explained, some numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our methods, and a comparison of our algorithms and the existing ones is made. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",20194607676694,,"Wan, Qing (1, 2); Li, Jinhai (3, 4); Wei, Ling (2, 5); Qian, Ting (2, 6) ","(1) School of Science, Xi'an Polytechnic University, Shaanxi; 710048, China (2) Institute of Concepts, Cognition and Intelligence, Northwest University, Shaanxi; 710069, China (3) Data Science Research Center, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650500, China (4) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650500, China (5) School of Mathematics, Northwest University, Shaanxi; 710069, China (6) School of Science, Xi'an Shiyou University, Shaanxi; 710065, China ",IJARE4,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Approximation algorithms - Granular computing - Granulation - Numerical methods - Rough set theory,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Jinhai(jhlixjtu@163.com) ",10.1016/j.ijar.2019.11.001,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 19JK0380, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Education Department of Shaanxi Province; Number: 61772021, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 11971211 , 61562050 , 61573173 , 61772021 , 61976130 and 11801440 ) and the Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (No. 19JK0380 ).",,0888613X,,January 2020,English,Information granules,,52,85-105,,2020,Elsevier Inc.,International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,Optimal granule level selection: A granule description accuracy viewpoint,Granule description - Hot research topics - Lower and upper approximations - Multi-scale informations - Numerical experiments - Optimal granule level - Rough set theory (RST) - Universe of discourse,116
Chem. Eng. J.,"Biochar has attracted much attention as a green cost-effective adsorbent for heavy metal removals. However, previous studies generally found that biochar was only effective in a narrow low pH range for Cr(VI) removal, and less attention was paid to biochar which can be effectively operated in a wider range of pH. This study showed that the jute fiber-based biochar pretreated H3PO4 can availably remove and reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in wastewater over a broadened operating pH range of 1–6, in which the intrinsic pH of Cr(VI) solution was included. For this, XRD, Raman, SEM, elemental analysis and N2 adsorption- desorption techniques were utilized to characterize the structure and compositions of the biochars. FTIR, XPS, Boehm titration and zeta potential measurements were performed to determine the surface group and charge distributions. It was revealed that in comparison with the biochar activated by KOH, H3PO4-treated biochar offered sufficient acidic groups such as phosphonic acid and carboxyl on the surface, from which the supplied protons could maintain the pH within a stable range of 1.9–3.4. XPS analysis exhibited that the electron-rich C–O, P–O and C–P bonds acted electron donating moieties to reduce high potential Cr(VI). Cr(VI) uptake experiments showed that Freundlich multilayer chemisorption occurred on the heterogeneous surface. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model suggested the surface reaction was the rate-controlling step. The examination for simulated samples confirmed that the H3PO4-treated biochar could control Cr(VI) pollution at the inherent pH in the environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193707432558,122739.0,"Chen, Mingxin (1); He, Feifei (2); Hu, Dongwen (1); Bao, Chongzhuo (1); Huang, Qiang (1) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Agriculture, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",CMEJAJ,"531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 819.1 Natural Fibers - 911.2 Industrial Economics",,,,,Adsorption - Cost effectiveness - Heavy metals - Jute fibers - pH - Pollution control - Potassium hydroxide - Reduction - Surface reactions - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Qiang(huangqiang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.cej.2019.122739,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51964045, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51964045 ) and Program for Innovative Research in University of Yunnan Province, and the technical support from the Modern Analysis and Testing Center of Yunnan University .

Sol. Energy,"A new solar adsorption refrigeration system integrated with a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) adsorber was proposed. Comparative experiments were conducted to investigate the system behaviour with the enhanced and natural mass transfer cycle under different weather conditions in Kunming, China. The parameter λ (the refrigerant utilization ratio) was defined to describe and compare the effective utilization ratio of the refrigerant in a refrigeration cycle for some different adsorption refrigeration system with a different quantity of the adsorbent and refrigerant. The results show that the system performance level with the enhanced mass transfer cycle is always higher than the system performance level with the natural mass transfer cycle under different weather conditions. On sunny day with a clear sky, the volume of the desorbed refrigerant and the COPsolar with the enhanced mass transfer cycle were increased by 39.2% and 39.0%, respectively, compared with the natural mass transfer cycle. The refrigerant utilization ratio in the CPC adsorption refrigeration system could be improved by 32.5% and 51.2% for the natural and enhanced mass transfer cycle compared with the non-CPC adsorption refrigeration system, respectively. While on sunny day with a partly cloudy sky, the volume of the desorbed refrigerants and the COPsolar with the enhanced mass transfer cycle were improved by 51.7% and 52.8%, respectively, compared with the natural mass transfer cycle.

Chaos Solitons Fractals,"Past experiences have an important impact on people's behavioral decisions. In this paper, we propose an epidemiological model to study the impact of historical payoff on the vaccination behavior on scale-free network. The individual's fitness is not affected by historical payoff when an individual's payoff is higher than his neighbor's average payoff. On the contrary, individual's fitness depends on a certain extent on the previous round of his own payoff. Through numerical simulation, our results show that the historical payoff has negative effect on the vaccination behavior on scale-free network. We will explain these results in terms of network heterogeneity in this article.

J. Hydrol.,"Water isotopes in precipitation provide new insight on the controlling factors for moisture source variations on the Tibetan Plateau. However, understanding the intra-annual water isotope cycle is difficult for a region lack of winter precipitation. Here, we reported water vapor δ18O and δ2H time series over two and half years at Lhasa on the southern Tibetan Plateau. We compare our values with concurrent daily precipitation isotopes to assess the seasonal controls of vapor isotopes and possible correlation to precipitation isotopes. Results show an intra-seasonal dependence of water vapor δ18O on large scale meteorological regime. During the winter months, vapor water δ18O shows positive dependence on regional-scale temperature, confirming a Rayleigh-distillation controlling moisture transport. During the summer months, lower vapor δ18O is weekly in association with the heavy precipitation over tropical Indian Ocean and on the Tibetan Plateau, and this relation is further enhanced by the evaporation of precipitation at the sampling site. We also found a weak seasonal variation of vapor d-excess, likely resulted from climate seasonality over the large moisture sources region. Moreover, the isotope dataset contains a high-frequency of fluctuations for both δ18O and d-excess lasting several days during the summer monsoon season. These high frequency fluctuations are in phase with precipitation events, confirming significant local evaporation effects on the short-term water cycle, which further complicated the control of near surface water vapor isotopes. These findings improve our regional scale understanding of hydrological cycle on the southern Tibetan Plateau, and will potentially improve our understanding of isotope variations in proxy archives in the Tibetan Plateau. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194307566315,124237.0,"Tian, Lide (1, 2, 3); Yu, Wusheng (2, 4); Schuster, Paul F.

Renew. Energy,"Preparation of methyl palmitate, isopropyl palmitate, isobutyl palmitate, and isoamyl palmitate was carried out using pyridine n-butyl bisulfate ionic liquid as catalyst in a self-designed reactor to catalyze esterification reaction of palmitic acid with methanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol, respectively. According to the single-factor experimental results, an orthogonal test of four factors and three levels was carried out for branched-chain alkyl esters of palmitic acid under different reaction time, reaction temperature, and catalyst dosage. Verification test was conducted under the optimal conditions, and the conversion in all the cases was up to 97%. Analysis of the reaction kinetics of methyl palmitate, isopropyl palmitate, isobutyl palmitate, and isoamyl palmitate was carried out by the integral method. Reaction order, frequency factor, activation energy, and reaction kinetic model were determined. Compared to methyl palmitate, the kinematic viscosity of the branched-chain alkyl esters of palmitic acid was slightly higher; however, the solidifying point (SP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) decreased with increasing degree of branched-chain. The CFPP reduced by up to 15 °C. Therefore, the use of branched-chain alcohol instead of methanol ester exchange descaling method can effectively reduce the SP and CFPP of biodiesel to improve its cold flow properties. © 2019",20193807447903,,"Ni, Zihao (1, 2); Zhai, Yuling (1, 2); Li, Fashe (1, 2); Wang, Hua (1, 2); Yang, Kai (1, 2); Wang, Bican (1, 2); Chen, Yu (1, 2) ","(1) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity,,,,,Activation energy - Association reactions - Catalysts - Esterification - Esters - Ionic liquids - Kinetics - Metal cleaning - Methanol - Reaction kinetics - Saturated fatty acids,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhai, Yuling(zhaiyuling00@126.com) ",10.1016/j.renene.2019.08.138,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18790682.0,"Number: 2018FB092, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: U1602272, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51766007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","*Corresponding author: Yu-ling Zhai (1986-), doctor of engineering, mainly engaged in energy conversion and utilization.

J Alloys Compd,"SnO2 is regarded as a promising negative material candidate for contemporary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the nanostructured SnO2 electrodes suffer from rapid capacity fades during lithiation and delithiation at a high-current density due to active materials aggregating and cracking. Herein, we designed and fabricated a novel multilayered hollow TiO2@SnO2@C sphere electrode though a facile three-step sol-gel coating process and hydrothermal strategy. The SnO2 nanoparticles are well confined between an outermost high-conductivity carbon layer and innermost stable hollow TiO2 nanospheres that form the pillar structure of the entire composite. Attributed to the internal spherical titanium dioxide as a support layer, the structural integrity of the composite and the possible anti-inward rupture can be effectively improved. As a result, the as-prepared TiO2@SnO2@C electrode exhibits a remarkable reversible capacity of 484 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 300 cycles and delivers outstanding capacity of 263 mAh g−1 at 3 A g−1. Moreover, this unique SnO2 hollow sphere structure with TiO2 as the innermost stable pillar will have implications for the design of high-power-density negative materials for future lithium-ion batteries. © 2019",20193907471715,152342.0,"Wang, Sai (1); Yu, Xiaohua (1); Liu, Jianxiong (1); Dong, Peng (2); Zhang, Yingjie (1, 2); Zhu, Chengyi (1); Zhan, Zhaolin (1); Zhang, Yannan (2) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Lithium-ion Batteries and Materials Preparation Technology, Key Laboratory of Advanced Battery Materials of Yunnan Province, Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",JALCEU,761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 812.3 Glass - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Carbon - Electrodes - Ions - Nanoparticles - Nanospheres - Sol-gel process - Sol-gels - Spheres - Tin dioxide - TiO2 nanoparticles - Titanium dioxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yannan(zyn_legolass@163.com) ",10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152342,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2018FB087, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51665022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51764029 , 51665022 , and 51601081 ) and Yunnan Natural Science Foundation (No. 2018FB087 ) are gratefully acknowledged.",,09258388,,25 January 2020,English,Lithium-ion batteries,,48,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,Encapsulation of SnO2 nanoparticles between the hollow TiO2 nanosphere and the carbon layer as high-performance negative materials for lithium-ion batteries,High current densities - High power density - Hollow Sphere Structures - Negative materials - Reversible capacity - Sphere electrodes - Spherical titanium dioxides - Volume expansion,814
J. Colloid Interface Sci.,"In this work, water-stable Al-MIL-101 analogues were successfully synthesized by adjusting the Fe/Al ratio to obtain excellent phosphorus removal efficiencies. The introduction of Fe3+ into the precursor solution allowed the final structure of aluminum metal-organic frameworks (Al-MOFs) to be tuned without introducing Fe into the final structure. The formation of Al-MIL-101 analogues with different morphologies and surface areas was accomplished by adjusting the Fe/Al molar ratio in the precursor solution. Compared with pure Fe-MIL-101 or Al-MIL-101, Al-MIL-101 analogues exhibited ultra-fast phosphorous adsorption kinetics and high phosphorous adsorption capacities. Al-MIL-101, produced with an Fe/Al feed molar ratio of 0.5, achieved a maximum phosphorus uptake capacity of 90 mg P/g, which is much higher than the phosphorus absorption reported in most literatures. More importantly, the Al-MIL-101 analogue obtained using an Fe/Al molar ratio of 0.5 exhibited an excellent phosphorus removal efficiency, even after multiple adsorption/desorption cycles. These results indicate that Al-MOFs produced by adjusting the Fe amount in the precursor solution are promising candidates for the removal of phosphate from water. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",20194407593359,,"Li, Shengjian (1); Lei, Ting (1); Jiang, Fang (1); Liu, Meng (1); Wang, Yating (1); Wang, Shixiong (1); Yang, Xiangjun (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource (Yunnan University), Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",JCISA5,545.1 Iron - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Adsorption - Crystalline materials - Efficiency - Iron - Morphology - Organometallics - Phosphorus,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shixiong(wangshixiong@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.077,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10957103.0,"Number: 2019HA005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","This work was financially supported by Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (No. 2018FB014 ), Major project of Kunming Science and Technology bureau (No. 2017-1-S-12305 ) and Free exploration fund for academician (No. 2019HA005 ).

Solid State Ionics,"The phonon variations, photoluminescence emission and electrical properties were systematically studied in Er3+ doped Bi3YO6 (Bi3Y1−xErxO6) oxide-ion conductors. The unit cell parameters (a and V) undergo a first increase and subsequent decrease trend with x, which is attributed to the fluctuations of the O occupation at 48i site. Five fundamental and new phonon mode splitting by Er3+ were observed by reflective FT-IR Reflectance spectroscopy, suggesting the locally structural distortion associated with the Er3+ octahedral occupancy. The Bi3Y1−xErxO6 ceramics of x = 0.2 exhibits the most intensive photoluminescence emission and a smallest activation energy of 1.1 eV. The high oxide-ion conductivity (>0.02 S/cm at 600 °C) was achieved, which can rival the most studied Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) system. The conductivities for all the Bi3Y1−xErxO6 ceramics present a curvature above 550 °C and a sudden decrease at x = 0.4.

J. Energy Chem.,"The side reaction between the active material and liquid-electrolyte cause structural damage and particle pulverization is one of the important factors leading to the capacity decay of LiNi0.80Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) materials in Li ion batteries (LIBs). Surface modification is an effective strategy for NCA cathodes, which could alleviate the degradation associated with surface processes. Herein, a surface structure rearrangement of NCA cathode secondary particles was reported by in-situ forming a solid electrolyte LiBO2. The LiBO2 is beneficial for alleviating the stress during charge/discharge process, thereby slowing down the rate of cracks formation in the secondary particles, which facilitates the Li+ de-intercalation as well as prevents penetration of the liquid-electrolyte into the interior of the particles. As a result, the surface structure rearrangement NCA (RS-NCA) delivers a high discharge capacity of 202.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, and exhibits excellent cycle stability with discharge capacity retaining 148 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 2 C.

Appl. Math. Comput.,"Punishment plays an important role in promoting cooperation. In real society, individuals tend to punish other players based on certain conditions rather than punish them directly. Thus, we introduce a conditional neutral punishment mechanism and study how this mechanism affects the evolution of cooperation. Namely, an individual can punish his/her neighbors with the opposite strategy when his/her payoff is lower than the average payoff of his/her neighbors. The simulation results show that this mechanism promotes cooperation effectively even with antisocial punishment. By adopting such a mechanism, cooperative punishers form shields to protect cooperators inside, while defective punishers hide behind defectors without punishing anyone. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",20194307570894,124798.0,"Song, Qun (1); Cao, Zhaoheng (2, 3); Tao, Rui (2, 3); Jiang, Wei (4); Liu, Chen (5); Liu, Jinzhuo (2, 3) ","(1) School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an; 710072,, China (2) Key Laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650091, China (3) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650504, China (4) Unit 78102 of the Chinese people's liberation army, Chengdu; 610000, China (5) Center for Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an; 710072, China, China ",AMHCBQ,951 Materials Science,,,,,Computational methods - Mathematical techniques,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Chen(liuc317@nenu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.amc.2019.124798,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: U1803263, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: III, Sponsor: Institute of Infection and Immunity; Number: 61866039, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2017ZZX08, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","We appreciate the support from (I) National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no.

Ceram Int,"For the application of inorganic phosphors in solid-state lighting field, exploring a synthesis route with low energy consumption and low cost is the current research focus. In this study, a low-temperature solid-state synthesis route for a novel Li2NaBP2O8:Eu3+ (LNBP:Eu) phosphor is reported. The phase structure, morphology, and elemental composition of its powder phase are characterized. According to photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data, the occupancy site and oxidation state of doping europium are discussed. Under near-UV (395 nm) excitation, the powder phase exhibits reddish-orange emission with a dominant 5D0 → 7F1 transition of europium. The intensity of visible photoluminescence is closely influenced by the europium doping content. The optimal content is 0.04 mol, and concentration quenching is ascribed to energy transfer among the nearest-neighbor europium ions. Moreover, chromatic properties are investigated in detail. The obtained data show that the LNBP:Eu powder phase is a prospective phosphor for application in near-UV-converted warm white light-emitting diodes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",20193707416506,,"Zhu, Jing (1, 2); Xiang, Jiyuan (1); Yang, Dan (1); Fang, Zhenyu (1); Zheng, Youkui (1); Mao, Yong (1); Zhao, Heyun (1) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory for Micro/nano Materials & Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",CINNDH,525.3 Energy Utilization - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics,,,,,Energy transfer - Energy utilization - Light emitting diodes - Phosphors - Photoluminescence - Temperature - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Jing(jzhu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.041,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2018ZE023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: U1502272, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Jing Zhu is grateful for the financial assistance from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21761034 and U1502272 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2018FB017 and 2018ZE023 ), and the Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University .

SCI. CHINA Phys. Mech. Astron.,"In this paper, we investigate the statistical signal-processing algorithm to measure the instant local clock jump from the timing data of multiple pulsars. Our algorithm is based on the framework of Bayesian statistics. In order to make the Bayesian algorithm applicable with limited computational resources, we dedicated our efforts to the analytic marginalization of irrelevant parameters. We found that the widely used parameter for pulsar timing systematics, the 'Efac' parameter, can be analytically marginalized. This reduces the Gaussian likelihood to a function very similar to the Student’s t-distribution. Our iterative method to solve the maximum likelihood estimator is also explained in the paper. Using pulsar timing data from the Yunnan Kunming 40-m radio telescope, we demonstrate the application of the method, where 80-ns level precision for the clock jump can be achieved. Such a precision is comparable to that of current commercial time transferring service using satellites. We expect that the current method could help developing the autonomous pulsar time scale. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.",20193507375459,219512.0,"Li, ZhiXuan (1, 3, 4); Lee, KeJia (2); Caballero, Ricardo Nicolaos (2); Xu, YongHua (1, 3, 4); Hao, LongFei (1, 4); Wang, Min (1, 4); Wang, JianCheng (1, 4) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650216, China (2) Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (4) Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650216, China ",,657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 713.4 Pulse Circuits - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922 Statistical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments,,,,,Clocks - Frequency standards - Maximum likelihood estimation - Pulsars - Signal processing - Time series analysis - Timing circuits,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lee, KeJia(kjlee@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11433-019-9428-4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18691927.0,,,,16747348,1.0,"January 1, 2020",English,Iterative methods,,27,,,2020,Science in China Press,"Science China: Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy",Measuring clock jumps using pulsar timing,Bayesian algorithms - Bayesian statistics - Computational resources - Marginalization - Maximum likelihood estimator - Statistical signal processing - T distribution - Time-scales,63
Chem. Eng. J.,"CO2 sorption at high temperature is recently attracting increasing attention. In the study, lithium silicate (Li4SiO4) based sorbents were synthesized using sepiolite as silicon source. The effect of the purity, crystallite size, and specific surface area of Li4SiO4 synthesized by different methods on the CO2 sorption performance were studied systematically. Moreover, the CO2 uptake of Li4SiO4 sorbents was improved by using K2CO3. The relationship between the CO2 uptake performance and doping amount of K2CO3 under different CO2 partial pressure was investigated in detail. Results show that the doping amount of K2CO3 was 17.5 wt%, 12.5 wt% and 15 wt%, the CO2 sorption value of synthesized Li4SiO4 samples was 27.67 wt%, 30.69 wt%, 32.95 wt%, respectively.

Renew. Energy,"The resistance of biodiesel fuels to autoxidation can be improved by mixing them with antioxidants. In this study, the effectiveness of 10 conventional antioxidants added to rubber seed oil biodiesel was investigated. According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015 version), the soluble interval was evaluated and Rancimat method using EN 14112 was adopted to determine the antioxidative effect of conventional antioxidants in rubber seed oil biodiesel. Moreover, this study also revealed the oil-soluble properties of conventional antioxidants in biodiesel at different temperatures and investigated the change rule of their oil-soluble properties. The results indicated that 10 common antioxidants could improve the antioxidative performance of rubber seed oil biodiesel to a certain extent; however, their effects were quite different. At room temperature (20 °C), conventional antioxidants exhibited relatively poor oil-soluble properties, with great discrepancy. The decreasing order of oil-soluble properties of 10 conventional antioxidants in rubber seed oil biodiesel is as follows: BHA > TBHQ > D-TBHQ > PA > PG > OG > VC > MT > AP > GA. With increasing temperature, the oil-soluble properties of 10 antioxidants somewhat improved; however, their soluble interval changed only slightly. A weak relationship was observed between the antioxidative performance and oil-soluble properties of 10 conventional antioxidants. Noteworthy, in practical production applications, the antioxidative performance and oil-soluble properties of antioxidants are important factors in the selection of appropriate antioxidants. © 2019",20192607105091,,"Ni, Zi-hao (1, 2); Li, Fa-she (1, 2); Wang, Hua (1, 2); Wang, Shuang (1, 2); Gao, Sheng-yang (1, 2); Zhou, Li (1, 2) ","(1) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",,523 Liquid Fuels - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 818.1 Natural Rubber,,,,,Biodiesel - Oils and fats - Rubber,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Fa-she(asanli@foxmail.com) ",10.1016/j.renene.2019.04.045,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18790682.0,"Number: 2018FB092, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resources Utilization; Number: 51766007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Corresponding author: Fa-She Li (1978-), Shandong province, doctor of engineering, professor, mainly engaged in energy and power research.

Renew. Energy,"The degradation rate of lignocellulose and methane (CH4) content must be improved through anaerobic fermentation process engineering in order to promote the proper operation of anaerobic organic waste removal without secondary pollution and low cost. The present study investigates mesophilic anaerobic fermentation of dairy manure (DM) under weak magnetic and low operation voltage (0.3–0.8 V). The results showed that the effect of electric and magnetic fields (EMF) can significantly enhance the fermentation, and improve the CH4 content of biogas and accelerate the degradation rate of lignocellulose. Fe-C microelectrolysis intensified the anaerobic fermentation of DM, the highest CH4 content was 87%, the cellulose degradation rate was 36%, increased by 125%, and the lignin degradation rate was 23%, increased by 203%, under loading 0.5 V voltage and weak magnetic field. Metagenome sequence results showed that EMF and Fe-C microelectrolysis can not only promote the microbial diversity, but also increase the abundance of functional microorganisms at various stages. This finding provides theoretical support and foundation for the extraordinary efficiency degradation of lignocellulose and the electric and magnetic regulation of anaerobic fermentation microorganism system. © 2019",20193507379233,,"Qu, Guangfei (1); Lv, Pei (1); Cai, Yingying (1); Tu, Can (1); Ma, Xi (1); Ning, Ping (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science & Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",,"461.8 Biotechnology - 461.9 Biology - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives - 821.5 Agricultural Wastes - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics",,,,,Cellulose - Cost engineering - Degradation - Fermentation - Fertilizers - Iron compounds - Lignin - Magnetic fields - Manures - Methane - Microorganisms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ning, Ping(ningpinglab@163.com) ",10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.050,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18790682.0,"Number: 2014ZX07105-001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China National Critical Project for Science and Technology on Water Pollution Prevention and Control; Number: 21467011, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors greatly acknowledge the funding support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21467011 ) and the National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project (No. 2014ZX07105-001 ).,,09601481,,February 2020,English,Biodegradation,,60,2758-2765,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Renewable Energy,Enhanced anaerobic fermentation of dairy manure by microelectrolysis in electric and magnetic fields,Anaerobic fermentation - Effective microorganisms - Electric and magnetic fields - Lignocellulose degradation - Methane content,146
Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"This paper addresses the feature screening issue for ultrahigh-dimensional data with responses missing at random. A novel nonparametric feature screening procedure is developed to identify the important features via the conditionally imputing marginal Spearman rank correlation. The proposed nonparametric screening approach has several desirable merits. First, it is nonparametric without assuming any regression form of predictors on response variable. Second, it is robust to outliers and heavy-tailed data. Third, under some regularity conditions, it is shown that the proposed feature screening procedure has the sure screening and ranking consistency properties. Simulation studies evidence that the proposed screening procedure outperforms several existing model-free screening procedures. An example taken from the microarray diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma study is used to illustrate the proposed methodologies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193607396975,106828.0,"Li, Xiaoxia (1); Tang, Niansheng (1); Xie, Jinhan (1); Yan, Xiaodong (1) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Statistical Modeling and Data Analysis, Yunnan University, Kunming, 650500, PR China; School of Economics, Shandong University, Jinan, 250100, PR China ",CSDADW,903.1 Information Sources and Analysis,,,,,,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Niansheng(nstang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.csda.2019.106828,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 11671349, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11731101, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors are grateful to the Editor and two referees for their valuable suggestions that greatly improved the manuscript.

Phys A Stat Mech Appl,"This study examines whether firm life cycle stages affects idiosyncratic risk, market risk and total risk using data of Chinese listed non-financial firms from 2007 to 2016, and further explores the relationship between idiosyncratic risk and cash flow volatility by using an interaction term. To check propensity, we further divided our main sample into SOEs (State-owned Enterprises) and non-SOEs. Findings imply that all three risks are significantly higher during introduction, growth and decline stages because their competitive advantages, resource base, and capabilities are limited. Results showing risks are lower during mature stage. Further, we examine cash flow volatility and found that, respective of firm life cycle stages, it varies in affecting these types of risks.

Chem. Eng. J.,"Heavy metal is a serious environmental issue mostly because of their toxicity and bioaccumulation. The recovering and recycling of the adsorbents became a bottleneck in heavy metal removal through adsorption. A hybrid adsorbent MnFe2O4@CAC showed great application potential because of its easy regeneration. However, as for other commonly used adsorbents, the removal performance of different types of heavy metals are distinctively different, but the mechanism is still unclear. To address this knowledge gap, the electron-scale behavior and adsorption mechanism of six divalent cations (Cu(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Hg(II)) on MnFe2O4@CAC were investigated in-depth combining experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The experimental results showed the order of adsorption: Ni(II) > Cu(II) > Co(II) > Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Hg(II). The reaction from transition state to the final product was the rate-determining step for the Cu(II), Pb(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) adsorption, while the reaction from reactant to intermediate controlled the adsorption rate of Cd(II) and Hg(II). The main adsorption mechanisms were surface complexation and ionic exchange, which were further confirmed by the spectroscopic (Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, FT-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS) characterizations and DFT calculations. In addition, the electron density of state (DOS) results indicated the 4s orbit of the cations most easily to be occupied by the d electrons of MnFe2O4. The order of adsorption affinity agreed well with the apparent adsorption, and was decided by the electronic empty orbit and ionic electron cloud size of the cations. The results of the current study provide an in-depth understanding on the adsorption mechanism of heavy metals and offer a theoretical guidance for improving their removal efficiency. © 2019",20193607396603,122656.0,"Chen, Quan (1, 2); Tang, Zhenya (1, 2); Li, Hao (1, 2); Wu, Min (1, 2); Zhao, Qing (3); Pan, Bo (1, 2) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science & Engineering, Kunming University of Science & Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Lab of Soil Carbon Sequestration and Pollution Control, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (3) Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang; 110016, China ",CMEJAJ,531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Adsorption - Biochemistry - Cobalt compounds - Copper compounds - Density functional theory - Electron affinity - Electrons - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Heavy metals - Ion exchange - Lead compounds - Mercury compounds - Nickel compounds - Positive ions - Reaction intermediates - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pan, Bo(panbocai@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.cej.2019.122656,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2017YFD0801000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 2018HC065, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFD0801000), National Natural Scientific Foundation of China (U1602231, 41725016 and 41663013), and Yunnan Provincial Scientific Innovation Team of Soil Environment and Ecological Safety, Kunming University of Science and Technology (2018HC065).",,13858947,,1 February 2020,English,Cadmium compounds,,50,,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Chemical Engineering Journal,An electron-scale comparative study on the adsorption of six divalent heavy metal cations on MnFe2O4@CAC hybrid: Experimental and DFT investigations,Adsorption affinity - DFT calculation - Electronic transfers - Heavy metal cations - Spectroscopic evidence,381
Adv. Intell. Sys. Comput.,"Software evolution is an important research direction and research focus in the field of software engineering. During the process of software dynamic evolution, the existence of conflicts between evolutionary components and original components is one of the key factors determining whether the dynamic evolution process is corrected or not. To solve this problem, resource management method is introduced and the concept of resource in software evolution process is redefined. According to the different patterns of resources used, sequence, selection and conflict relationship models among components are defined. And at last, a conflict-capture algorithm, which is used to capturing the components involved in the conflict relationships, based on recourse management. The results of this paper lay a theoretical foundation for maintaining consistency before and after evolution and ensuring the correctness of dynamic evolution. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",20191906902758,,"Gao, Tilei (1, 2); Li, Tong (3); Zhu, Rui (1); Jiang, Rong (2); Yang, Ming (2) ","(1) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650000, China (2) School of Information, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650000, China (3) Key Laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650000, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 912.2 Management",225489.0,"August 17, 2018 - August 19, 2018","Shanghai, China","8th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Networks, CENet 2018",Computer networks - Natural resources management - Resource allocation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Ming(83300934@qq.com) ",10.1007/978-3-030-14680-1_58,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61263022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61303234, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61379032, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61662085, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61763048, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61379032, 61763048, 61263022, 61303234, 61662085), National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 12XTQ012), Science and Technology Foundation of Yunnan Province (No. 2017FB095), Yunnan Province Applied Basic Research Project (No. 2016FD060), Science Research Project of Yunnan Education (Nos. 2017ZZX001, 2017ZZX227), Key Project of Scientific Research of Yunnan Education (2015Z018), Provincial Scientific and Technological Innovation Team Project of Yunnan University (2017HC012), the 18th Yunnan Young and Middle-aged Academic and Technical Leaders Reserve Personnel Training Program (No. 2015HB038).",9783030146795.0,21945357,,2020,English,Computer software,"The 8th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Networks, CENet 2018",18,530-537,1 of 1,2020,Springer Verlag,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,A research about a conflict-capture method in software evolution,Conflict capture - Dynamic evolution - Evolutionary components - Relationship model - Resource management - Software Evolution - Software evolution process - Theoretical foundations,905

Agric. Water Manage.,"In order to select environmentally friendly mulching materials and to increase rainwater utilization in a semiarid region of Northwest China, a field experiment was conducted using a randomized complete design to determine effects of three furrow-mulching materials (liquid film (LF), maize straw (MS) and biodegradable film (BF)) on soil temperature, moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), crop (maize and sorghum) yields and water use efficiency (WUE) with no-mulching (NM) as a control, during three consecutive crop growing seasons in years 2013-2015. Silage, grain, and biomass yields and WUE for maize were 1.75, 1.87, 1.82 and 1.76 times greater than corresponding yields and WUE for sorghum during the study period. BF increased topsoil temperature and soil water storage, while MS decreased topsoil temperature but increased soil water storage. Compared with NM, the increase in average topsoil temperature at the furrow bottoms of BF was 1.05–1.37 ºC during the growing seasons for maize, while it was 1.07–1.25 ºC during the growing seasons for sorghum. During the growing seasons, the decrease in topsoil temperature at the furrow bottoms for MS was 1.22–1.81 ºC for maize, while it was 1.34–1.59 ºC for sorghum. BF and MS decreased furrow soil evaporation but increased crop transpiration, while they did not shift the total water loss from ET. BF resulted in high soil temperature and moisture, increased crop yields, and WUE. Although low temperatures impaired emergence and crop development, high soil moisture increased crop yields and WUE with MS. Compared with NM, BF treatments resulted in increased mean silage, mean grain and mean biomass yields for maize of 17.0%, 17.7% and 13.7%, respectively, while corresponding yields for sorghum increased by 12.9%, 17.0% and 11.7%, respectively. The mean silage, grain, and biomass yields for maize with MS increased by 9.3%, 12.1% and 8.0 %, respectively, while corresponding yields for sorghum increased by 5.6%, 14.3% and 6.7%, respectively. Mean WUEs for maize and sorghum with BF significantly increased by 4.8 and 2.6 kg ha−1mm−1, respectively, while those values with MS significantly increased by 3.8 and 2.8 kg ha−1mm−1. MS provided a lower increase (12.1 %–14.3 %) in grain yields compared with BF (17.0 %-17.7%) in the study. LF had similar soil temperature and water moisture as with no mulching, and did not significantly increase either crop yields or WUE. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194807763895,105928.0,"Zhang, Dengkui (1); Wang, Qi (1); Zhou, Xujiao (1); Liu, Qinglin (2); Wang, Xiaoyun (1); Zhao, Xiaole (1); Zhao, Wucheng (1); He, Chenggang (3); Li, Xiaoling (4); Li, Guang (5); Chen, Jin (6) ","(1) College of Grassland Science, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou; 730070, China (2) Gansu Provincial Key Laboratory of Aridland Crop Science, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou; 730070, China (3) College of Tobacco Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China (4) College of Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou; 730070, China (5) College of Forestry, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou; 730070, China (6) Dingxi Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Dingxi; 743000, China ",AWMADF,443 Meteorology - 444 Water Resources - 446.1 Water Supply Systems - 461.9 Biology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Arid regions - Biomass - Cultivation - Efficiency - Evapotranspiration - Liquid films - Soil moisture - Temperature - Transpiration - Water supply,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Qi(wangqigsau@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105928,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18732283.0,"Number: 41461062, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41661059, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41661059 and 41461062).

Appl. Math. Model.,"Quantitatively analyzing the role of turbulence in the magnetic fluctuation-induced self-generating-organization region and the plasma turbulence-induced self-feeding-sustaining region, which is closely related to the evolution of null points and the magnetic helical structure, represents the key issues in understanding the magnetic energy release-conversion, plasma heating, and charged particles energization and acceleration in three-dimensional large temporal-spatial scale turbulent magnetic reconnection (3D LTSTMR). The first part of this two-paper series developed and validated the continuous kinetic-dynamic-hydro fully coupled temporal-spatial scale relativistic hybrid particle-in-cell and lattice Boltzmann (RHPIC-LBM) model and code for investigating the fine structure evolution of the 2.5D solar atmosphere LTSTMR activities. Based on the model and code developed in Part I, in this paper, we investigate the turbulence of the magnetic helical structure, current density vector fields, self-generating-organization magnetic potential vector fields, self-feeding-sustaining plasma motion, and the ion and electron acceleration of 3D LTSTMR with 100,000 CPU cores on the Tianhe-2 from National Supercomputer Center in Guang Zhou (NSCC-GZ). According to the simulation evidence, we discovered and confirmed the following results: (i) Slipping magnetic reconnection (MR) exists in the adjacent magnetic field lines (MFLs) during the compress-stretch-slip process on the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs and MFLs drastically change and form a linkage span) and the adjacent MFLs’ break-rejoin MR exists on the separatrix surfaces (SLs). Both are consistent to observations; (ii) The slipping MR (defined as 1st type MR) and the MFLs’ break-rejoin MR (defined as 2nd type MR) are closely linked with the oblique and resistive tearing instabilities, respectively. In the 3D model, the 1st type MR forms O-type null points, while the 2nd type MR forms X-type null points. The magnetic energy conversion is dominated by turbulence-induced oblique instabilities in the 3D model instead of the resistive tearing instabilities in the 2D/2.5D model, which is consistent with the 3D observations; (iii) Magnetic energy conversion occurs in the interaction of the plasmoid-to-flux rope, plasmoid-to-plasmoid, and flux rope-to-flux rope. The turbulent acceleration is an independent acceleration mechanism in LTSTMR, induced by the interaction of waves-to-waves and waves-to-particles, which is different from the original hybrid acceleration mechanism (composed of parallel electric fields, betatron, shock and Fermi); (iv) Particles can be energized and accelerated at a longer time scale (−30 s) and can be accelerated to relativistic energies after being pre-accelerated by a Fermi-Betatron-shock wave acceleration process. These results are in agreement with the observations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",20192206994065,,"Zhu, Bojing (1, 2); Yan, Hui (3); Zhong, Ying (3); Chen, Jingkun (3); Du, Yunfei (3); Cheng, Huihong (4, 5); A Yuen, David (6) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650216, China (2) Center for Astronomical Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100012, China (3) National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou; 510006, China (4) Key Laboratory of Computing Geodynamics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (5) College of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (6) Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics Department, Columbia University, New York; 10027, United States ",AMMODL,525.5 Energy Conversion Issues - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 932.1.1 Particle Accelerators - 932.3 Plasma Physics,,,,,3D modeling - Acceleration - Betatrons - Charged particles - Electric fields - Energy conversion - Magnetic bubbles - Magnetic fields - Plasma turbulence - Rope - Shock waves - Supercomputers,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Bojing(bjzhu@ynao.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.apm.2019.05.027,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: QYZDJ-SSWSLH012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: XDA17040507, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2016ZT06D211, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: 11333007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the strategic priority research program of CAS (XDA17040507, XDA15010900), the national basic research program of China ( 2013CBA01503 ), the key program of NSFC ( 11333007 ), joint funds of NSFC ( U1631130 ), frontier science key programs of CAS (QYZDJ-SSWSLH012), the program for innovation team of Yunnan Province, the program for Guangdong introducing Innovative and entrepreneurial teams (2016ZT06D211), and the special program for applied research on super computation of the NSFC -Guangdong joint fund (second phase) under No. U1501501 .

Sep. Sci. Technol.,"To selectively separate arsenic from arsenic-containing copper dust, this paper reports a new method of treating the dust by carbothermal reduction and roasting it with coke powder at low temperatures. The effects of different roasting temperatures, coke powder additions and roasting times are discussed. Optimum conditions were obtained to selectively separate arsenic from other valuable metals. The volatilization rate of arsenic was 97.02% and the content of arsenic in the slag was 0.31%. Other valuable metals were not volatile under the conditions of a 350°C roasting temperature, coke powder addition of 30%wt, coke powder particle size of 0.15–1 mm, and a roasting time of 150 min. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",20185206307592,,"Li, Xuepeng (1); Liu, Dachun (1); Wang, Juan (2); Song, Jianxun (3) ","(1) National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan, China (2) School of Mathematics, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan, China (3) Henan Province Industrial Technology Research Institute of Resources and Materials, Zhenzhou University, Zhenzhou, China ",SSTEDS,451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 524 Solid Fuels - 544.1 Copper - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Arsenic - Calcination - Coke - Copper - Dust - Particle size - Powder metals - Slags - Temperature - Vaporization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Dachun(240139925@qq.com) ",10.1080/01496395.2018.1559860,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205754.0,"Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the Project (U1502271) supported by National Natural Science Foundation?of China.,,01496395,1.0,"January 2, 2020",English,Carbothermal reduction,,18,88-97,,2020,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Separation Science and Technology (Philadelphia),Selective removal of arsenic from arsenic-containing copper dust by low-temperature carbothermal reduction,Arsenic trioxide - Coke powder - Low temperatures - Optimum conditions - Roasting temperature - Selective removal - Valuable metals,55
Phys E,"The synergy effect on structural properties, electronic properties, and optical properties when changing strain and the number of layers at the same time of 2D black phosphorus (BP) are calculated in this paper by using first-principles calculations. The results show that with the number of the layer increased, the band-gap shows a decreasing trend, whereas the absorption edge shows a trend of red-shift. When we put different in-layer biaxial strain from −10% compressive strain (a/a0 = 90%) to 10% tensile strain (a/a0 = 110%) on all few-layer BP layers, the electronic, optical and structural properties change. In terms of electronic property, few-layer BP shows an increasing trend of the band-gap, and at the same time, a distinct change of chemical bond has been observed. As for the optical property, an anisotropic variation of the absorption and reflectivity occurs. And for the structural property, there is a noticeable regular anisotropic change of the stacking order. In our opinion, the increasing number of layers affects band splitting around the Γ point and entire BZ, which leads to the decrease of the gap. The changing of the layer from 5 L to 1L and the strain from −10% compressive strain to 10% tensile strain affect the stacking order and the change of near-band-states of few-layer BP, which further impacts the band-gap, chemical bond and its transition from metal to semiconductor of BP. Besides, the strain effect leads to the anisotropic change of the structure, which further results in the anisotropic change in the optical properties of the few-layer BP. This study implies that we can alter the function of the few-layer material by setting up the suitable strain and the number of the layer in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194307578994,113791.0,"Chen, Qing-Yuan (1); Liu, Ming-yang (1); Cao, Chao (2); He, Yao (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, NO.2 Green Lake North Road, Wu Hua Qu, Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, NO.16 Xue Lin Street, Xia Sha Gao Jiao Yuan Qu, Hangzhou; Zhe Jiang Province; 310036, China ",PELNFM,"408 Structural Design - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921 Mathematics - 931.1 Mechanics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Anisotropy - Calculations - Chemical bonds - Electronic properties - Energy gap - Phosphorus - Red Shift - Structural properties,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","He, Yao(yhe@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.physe.2019.113791,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013HA019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 61751405, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2018ZE023, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.

Phys A Stat Mech Appl,"We investigate the stochastic resonance dynamic behavior characteristics of price drawdown time series driven by internal and external periodic information and discuss the influence of information resonance on price drawdown risk, based on price drawdown, periodic Heston model and signal power amplification. A theoretical model of the periodic price drawdown time series is proposed to describe the energy price drawdown time series with the periodic Heston model. Then the signal power amplification (SPA) is employed to measure the stochastic resonance phenomenon in the internal and external periodic information environment of complex energy dynamics system. Combined with the real data of WTI spot price of NYMEX, the least square method of drawdown time series distribution is used to estimate the parameters of the model. The probability density functions of drawdown between the theoretical model and the real data are compared, and a good agreement can be found between both the simulated data from the proposed model and the real data. After the stochastic simulation of signal power amplification under internal and external periodic information respectively, the results show that: (i) In the functions of SPA versus price volatility parameters (noise correlation strength or periodic information strength), inverse resonance phenomenon can be observed, that is to say, there is the best system price volatility parameter, noise correlation strength and information strength corresponding to the least risk of the price drawdown; (ii) In the SPA versus amplitude of volatility fluctuations, the correlation induce multiple inverse stochastic resonance phenomenon can be observed; (iii) The increase of growth rate strengthens SPA and weakens drawdown risk of energy market prices. © 2019",20194307579022,123098.0,"Dong, Yang (1); Wen, Shu-hui (1); Hu, Xiao-bing (3, 4); Li, Jiang-Cheng (2) ","(1) Faculty of Management and Economics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650032, China (2) School of Finance, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (3) China-France Research Center of Applied Mathematics for ATM, China (4) College of Electronic Information and Automation, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin; 300300, China ",PHYADX,701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 703.1 Electric Networks - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Amplification - Circuit resonance - Commerce - Costs - Density functional theory - Financial markets - Least squares approximations - Magnetic resonance - Power markets - Probability density function - Stochastic systems - Time series,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wen, Shu-hui(swen33@163.com) ",10.1016/j.physa.2019.123098,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 19YJAZH045, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; ",This work was supported by the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No.: 19YJAZH045).,,03784371,,15 February 2020,English,Stochastic models,,74,,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,Stochastic resonance of drawdown risk in energy market prices,Econophysicss - Information environment - Least square methods - Maximum drawdown - Signal power amplification - Stochastic resonances - Stochastic simulations - Theoretical modeling,540
Ceram Int,"Micron-sized lanthanum oxide powders are prepared by the calcination of lanthanum carbonate hydrate in microwave field. The decomposition process of lanthanum carbonate hydrate was analyzed by TG-DSC and indicates the reaction undergoes three stages, resulting in the generation of lanthanum oxide at 770 °C. For microwave assisted calcination, XRD patterns demonstrate that hexagonal La2O3 structure is initially formed after calcination at 650 °C for 2 h, and FT-IR analyses confirm the decomposition of precursor is complete after calcination at 750 °C for 2 h. SEM investigations reveal that 800 °C is the optimal calcination temperature to generate La2O3 powders with uniform morphologies. In comparison, conventionally calcination experiments are carried out in electrical furnace. Both XRD and FT-IR analyses are in consistence with TG-DSC, which indicate the temperature required for fully decomposition of lanthanum carbonate hydrate by conventional heating is higher than that of microwave heating. SEM images present irregular morphologies and wide particle size distribution of conventionally prepared samples. All the techniques are utilized to prove the feasibility of decomposing La2(CO3)3 to generate La2O3 in microwave field and highlight the advantages of microwave heating. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",20193707416448,,"Chen, Kaihua (1, 2); Guo, Shenghui (1, 2); Zeng, Yangqing (3); Huang, Weichao (3); Peng, Jinhui (1, 2); Zhang, Libo (1, 2); Yin, Shaohua (1, 2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Chinalco Guangxi Nonferrous Jinyuan Rare Earth Co., Ltd., Wanggao Industrial Zone in Hezhou, Guangxi; 542603, China ",CINNDH,711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Calcination - Carbonation - Hydrates - Hydration - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Powders - Scanning electron microscopy - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yin, Shaohua(yinsh@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.244,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 201708740007, Acronym: CSC, Sponsor: China Scholarship Council; Number: 51664035, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51664035 and No. 51504116 ) and China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201708740007 ).,,02728842,1.0,January 2020,English,Lanthanum oxides,,32,165-170,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Ceramics International,Facile preparation and characterization of lanthanum oxide powders by the calcination of lanthanum carbonate hydrate in microwave field,Comparison - Conventional heating - Decomposition process - Facile preparation - Irregular morphology - Microwave assisted - Microwave field - Optimal calcination,46

Vacuum,"In this paper, we proposed a modified zone vacuum melting process for producing high-purity aluminum. By modifying the effective redistribution coefficients, axial segregation of impurities are investigated. The impurities distribution along the ingots are obtained with different conditions, such as pass number, zone travel rate, initial impurity concentration. Based on the analysis, optimization of the vacuum purification process design is proposed. The samples with aluminum content of more than 5 N (99999.2 ppm) were obtained, and the optimum purification efficiency is significant when the zone melting rate is 1 mm/min, especially in the middle of the sample (No.3, No.4), which the removal rate of Fe, Zn and Cu is more than 70%, and the removal rates are 73.63%, 82.13% and 75.75%, respectively.

Mar. Pet. Geol.,"The origin of widespread organic-rich shales on the early Cambrian Yangtze Platform of Nanhua Basin (South China) has been attributed to high primary productivity. To test this hypothesis, we generated multiple paleoproductivity (OCAR and PAR), paleoredox (Corg/P ratios), upwelling/restriction (CoEF × MnEF, Co (ppm) × Mn (%), Mo/TOC, and Cd/Mo ratios), and terrigenous flux proxies (Al and unreactive Fe (FeU)) for the lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation in the outer-shelf Jinsha section, which records a typical transition from the organic-rich black shales to overlying organic-lean mudstones or siltstones. These new data were integrated with published paleoredox proxies (iron speciation and redox-sensitive trace metals) for the same section. Our results suggest that the organic-rich (TOC = 4.6 ± 1.8%) lower member (LM; 0–37 m) of the Niutitang Formation records ferruginous conditions, high productivity levels, and low siliciclastic fluxes, and that the organic-poor (TOC = 0.1 ± 0.1%) upper member (UM; 37–329 m) was characterized by dominantly oxic conditions, declining productivity levels, and high siliciclastic fluxes. Our results suggest a redox shift from ferruginous to oxic conditions and enhanced terrigenous fluxes in response to falling sea level from the LM to the UM. Secular variations in primary productivity and redox conditions are strongly correlated, which is consistent with a positive feedback: high primary productivity led to increasing water-column anoxia, which enhanced organic P recycling, stimulating further productivity. Variations in primary productivity may reflect variable upwelling intensity in a semi-restricted shelf setting linked to sea-level changes. Taken together, these findings suggest that a combination of primary productivity, redox conditions, and terrigenous fluxes driven by sea-level changes played a key role in organic matter accumulation on the early-Cambrian western Yangtze Platform. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193407327800,,"Jin, Chengsheng (1, 2, 3); Li, Chao (3); Algeo, Thomas J.

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"Imbalanced data, in which the data exhibit an unequal or highly-skewed distribution between its classes/categories, are pervasive in many scientific fields, with application range from bioinformatics, text classification, face recognition, fraud detection, etc. Imbalanced data in modern science are often of massive size and high dimensionality, for example, gene expression data for diagnosing rare diseases. To address this issue, a fused screening procedure is proposed for dimension reduction with large-scale high dimensional imbalanced data under repeated case-control samplings. There are several advantages of the proposed method: it is model-free without any model specification for the underlying distribution; it is relatively inexpensive in computational cost by using the subsampling technique; it is robust to outliers in the predictors. The theoretical properties are established under regularity conditions.

Int J Prod Econ,"Innovation performance assessment of new products in a high-technology industry is conducive to assessing the quality of innovation. Therefore, it improves the operational efficiency of enterprises. It is of great significance for innovation policy-making. This paper presents a theoretical framework for evaluating innovation performance in which the contribution of new product development funds is divided into several elements, including invention, utility model, and appearance design patents. Based on this framework, the elasticity of invention patents to new product sales revenue is divided by the elasticity of new product development funds to new product sales revenue, and the result is used as an indicator to evaluate the innovation performance of new products. Taking the interprovincial panel data of China's high-technology industry as an example, the relationships between the variables, including number of invention patents, new product development funds, R&D funds, and new product sales revenue, were studied comprehensively by using a panel data simultaneous equation model, Granger causality tests, a panel threshold regression (PTR) model, and a Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model. The results showed that the overall innovation performance of new products in China's high-technology industry, which reached only 42.9%, was unsatisfactory. Despite the poor performance of invention patents, the high-technology industry in China showed strong developmental potential and is entering a transformation period for innovation quality improvement. The overall performance of investments in developing new products was satisfactory. The contribution of new product development funds increased as the enterprise scale increased and as new product sales revenue increased. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20192507067813,,"Yu, Liping (1); Duan, Yunlong (2); Fan, Tianting (2) ","(1) School of Management and E-Business, Zhejiang GongShang University, Hangzhou; 310018, China (2) International Business School, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China ",IJPCEY,913.1 Production Engineering - 913.6 Product Development; Concurrent Engineering - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Economics - Elasticity - Product design - Product development - Sales - Statistical tests,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Duan, Yunlong(duanyl1977@126.com) ",10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.06.002,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,"We would like to thank the anonymous referee and the editor for their helpful suggestions and insightful comments, which have significantly improved the content and presentation of the paper.

Adv. Intell. Sys. Comput.,"Object detectors based on CNN are now able to achieve satisfactory accuracy, but their ability to deal with some targets with geometric deformation or occlusion is often poor. This is largely due to the fixed geometric structure of the convolution kernel and the single inflexible network structure. In our work, we use dual branch parallel processing to extract the different features of the target area to coordinate the prediction. To further enhance the performance of the network, this study rebuilds the feature extraction module. Finally, our detector learns to adapt to a variety of different shapes and sizes. The proposed method achieves upÂ to 81.76% mAP on the Pascal VOC2007 dataset and 79.6% mAP on the Pascal VOC2012 dataset. 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",20192006922576,,"Li, Jianjun (2); Zheng, Kai (2); Zhang, Xin (2); Luo, Zhenxing (1); Tang, Zhuo (1); Chang, Ching-Chun (3); Lin, Yuqi (4); Tang, Peiqi (2) ","(1) Science and Technology on Communication and Information Security Control Laboratory of the 36th Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Jiaxing, China (2) School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China (3) Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom (4) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Computer Technology Application/Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence,225499.0,"December 14, 2018 - December 16, 2018","Guilin, China","2nd International Conference on Security with Intelligent Computing and Big-data Services, SICBS 2018",Big data - Convolution - Deformation - Intelligent computing - Object recognition,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Jianjun(jianjun.li@hdu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-030-16946-6_64,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61871170, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Fund of China (No. 61871170) and the National Equipment Development Pre-research Fund: 6140137050202.,9783030169459.0,21945357,,2020,English,Object detection,Security with Intelligent Computing and Big-data Services - Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Security with Intelligent Computing and Big Data Services SICBS-2018,28,784-797,1 of 1,2020,Springer Verlag,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,A Dual-Branch CNN Structure for Deformable Object Detection,Branch structure - Convolution kernel - Convolution neural network - Deformable object - Geometric deformations - Geometric structure - Network structures - Parallel processing,895
Sol. Energy,"Strawberry production is greatly affected by environmental factors, especially temperature and light. A solar greenhouse with opaque photovoltaic (OPV) modules and a solar combined air source heat pump system was built for strawberry production. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of differences in both temperature and light factors caused by OPV modules and solar heating on strawberry growth and quality in a constructed greenhouse. The ‘Jingzangxiang’ strawberry was selected and planted in the greenhouse. The indoor temperature with the heating system was 5.3–7.3 °C higher than the ambient temperature at the coldest period in the city of Kunming. At noon, the chlorophyll content of the shaded strawberry plants was 1.3 times higher than that of the unshaded plants in sunny weather, and the average shaded photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was 230 μmol·m−2·s−1 in the greenhouse, where 25.9% of the roof was covered with OPV modules. Under this shading treatment, the optimum light range of PAR for the ‘Jingzangxiang’ strawberry was 387–437 μmol·m−2·s−1, and the optimum temperature range during the daytime was 20.5–27.4 °C. The largest single strawberry fruit weighed 33.9 g, and the soluble solids content of the shaded strawberry fruit was 16.4%, which was higher than that of the unshaded strawberry samples. Furthermore, the yield of the shaded samples was 1.2 times that of the unshaded samples. In summary, strawberry plants shaded by OPV modules were superior to unshaded strawberry plants in terms of growth, quality and yield. This research provides experimental support and information on the optimal temperature and light ranges for the growth of the ‘Jingzangxiang’ strawberry in solar greenhouse. © 2019",20194807758275,,"Tang, Yilian (1); Ma, Xun (1); Li, Ming (1); Wang, Yunfeng (1) ","(1) Solor Energy Research Institute, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",SRENA4,451 Air Pollution - 615.2 Solar Power - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 821.6 Farm Buildings and Other Structures,,,,,Air source heat pumps - Greenhouse effect - Greenhouses - Photovoltaic cells - Solar heating - Solar power generation - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ma, Xun(maxun@ynnu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.solener.2019.11.070,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51867022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51867022 ).,,0038092X,,1 January 2020,English,Fruits,,45,318-328,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Solar Energy,The effect of temperature and light on strawberry production in a solar greenhouse,Effect of temperature - Environmental factors - Photosynthetically active radiation - Photovoltaic modules - Solar greenhouse - Soluble solids content - Strawberry production - Temperature factor,195
Int J Electr Power Energy Syst,"The compensation circuits are the core to improve the flexibility of practical application of half-wavelength transmission lines (HWTL), which are restricted to the fixed transmission length due to the constant fundamental frequency. This paper proposes a mode-phase transformation based method to design the parameters of compensation circuits after comparison of frequency responses of three kinds of compensation circuits, e.g., T segments, Π segments and L segments. At first, the compensation circuit parameters are obtained in the modal system that separates the coupling multiconductor system into isolated circuits to avoid the complexity of the three-phase system. Then, the compensation circuit parameters can be transformed into multiconductor system by modal-phase transformation, which accomplishes the compensation circuit parameter design in three-phase system. Lastly, the parameters acquired by the proposed method are compared with the natural HWTL. Comprehensive simulations are undertaken which validate that the proposed method is more suitable for tuning HWTL. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193607397180,105520.0,"Cao, Pulin (1); Shu, Hongchun (1); Yang, Bo (1); Li, Shengnan (2); He, Tingyi (2); Yang, Lei (2); Han, Yiming (1); Yu, Tao (3) ","(1) Faculty of Electric Power Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Electric Power Research Institute of Yunnan Power Grid Co., Ltd., Kunming; 650217, China (3) College of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou; 510640, China ",IEPSDC,703.1 Electric Networks - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 801.4 Physical Chemistry,,,,,Electric network parameters - Electric power transmission - Frequency response - Phase transitions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Bo(yangbo_ac@outlook.com) ",10.1016/j.ijepes.2019.105520,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51807085, Acronym: NNSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51977102, Acronym: NNSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61963020, Acronym: NNSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundations of China under Grant 51807085, 51977102 and 61963020, and in part by the Yunnan Provincial Talents Training Program under Grant KKSY201604015.",,01420615,,February 2020,English,Electric lines,,31,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,Analysis of electrical length compensation types for tuned half-wavelength transmission lines,Compensation circuits - Electrical length - Fundamental frequencies - Half wavelength - Modal systems - Multiconductor systems - PI segment - Three phase system,115
Int J Electr Power Energy Syst,"With the integration of large-scale renewable energy, preventive maintenance (PM) of modular multi-level converter (MMC) has become a critical technique for guaranteeing the secure operation of long-distance transmission systems. However, existing PM strategies result in errors and extra costs because of ignoring the time-varying operational conditions (e.g. wind speed, air temperature and power current alternating) and constant redundant sub-modules (SM). To reduce PM-related costs with an acceptable level of reliability considering different operational conditions, a dynamical PM strategy is proposed. Compared with the traditional PM strategy, adjustable redundant SMs in every operational stage and PM interval are added to dynamically coordinate reliability and PM-related costs of MMC. The reliability model of MMC proposed in this paper considers the impact of different operational conditions based on multi-term thermal cycles of components and operating characteristics of MMC. Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the reliability of MMC, and the genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the PM interval and the number of redundant SM in every operational stage. Case studies show that the PM results vary with different operational conditions. Besides, compared with existing strategies, the proposed dynamic PM strategy could reduce the PM-related costs with an acceptable level of reliability by dynamically adjusting the PM interval and redundancy on every stage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20194007486796,105560.0,"Feng, Fei (1); Yu, Juan (1); Yang, Zhifang (1); Dai, Wei (1); Zhao, Xingpan (2); Kamel, Salah (1, 5); Wang, Jianxiao (3); Fu, Guobin (4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment & System Security and New Technology, College of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400030, China (2) Chuxiong Power Supply Bureau of Yunnan Power Grid, Chuxiong; 67500, China (3) Electrical Engineering Department, North China Electric Power University, Beijing; 102206, China (4) Electric Power Research Institute, State Grid Qinghai Electric Power Company, Xining; 810008, China (5) Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Aswan University, Aswan; 81542, Egypt ",IEPSDC,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 913.5 Maintenance - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Cost reduction - Electric power transmission - Genetic algorithms - Monte Carlo methods - Redundancy - Reliability - Thermal cycling - Wind,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Juan(148454745@qq.com) ",10.1016/j.ijepes.2019.105560,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: cstc2017jcyj-yszxX0011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2017YFB0902200, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 5228001700CW, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Foundation of State Grid Corporation of China; ","This work was supported in part by the Project Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant 2017YFB0902200 , the Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China under grant 5228001700CW , the academician-mentoring Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of Chongqing under grant cstc2017jcyj-yszxX0011 .

Sustainable Cities Soc.,"Solar heat utilization in medium temperature range (80–250) has attracted more and more attentions in the field of building and industry energy conservation. A heat transfer model for a novel parabolic trough solar collecting system with V-shaped cavity absorber is established based on the thermal resistance network method. Experimental validation was performed in different weather conditions to investigate the calculation accuracy of the proposed model. The analysis results demonstrate that the model calculation error mainly lies in the influence of wind speed deviation and the difference between the theoretical and actual temperature rise rate with the sudden changes of solar direct normal irradiation (DNI). By carrying out bias correction, the model calculated results were perfectly consistent with the experimental results. Based on the proposed model, the effects of different environmental factors on the outlet temperature and collecting efficiency were compared, and the comparison results can be used to correct the proposed model in different weather and environmental conditions, which make the proposed heat transfer model more reliable to the practical operation situation. As a result, the proposed model may provide a theoretical basis for the operation optimization of the solar collecting system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193907479853,101837.0,"Bie, Yu (1, 2); Li, Ming (2); Chen, Fei (1); Królczyk, Grzegorz (3); Li, Zhixiong (4) ","(1) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Solar Energy Research Institute, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (3) Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Automation Products, Opole University of Technology, Opole; 45758, Poland (4) Department of Marine Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266100, China & School of Mechanical, Materials, Mechatronic and Biomedical Engineering, University of Wollongong, NSW; 2522, Australia ",,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 702.3 Solar Cells,,,,,Collector efficiency - Heat resistance - Historic preservation - Wind,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhixiong(zhixiong.li@ieee.org) ",10.1016/j.scs.2019.101837,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2017FB092, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; Number: 51979261, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: DE190100931, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 05300205020516009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: tsqn201812025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Taishan Scholar Foundation of Shandong Province; Number: 2015DFA60120, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is supported by the Collaborative Innovation Center of Research and Development of Renewable Energy in the southwest area in China (No.: 05300205020516009 ), NSFC China (No.: 51979261 ), Taishan Scholar in China ( tsqn201812025 ), the Project on Co-establishing China-Laos Joint Lab for Renewable Energy (No.: 2015DFA60120 ), the Science and Technology Planning Project in Yunnan Province, China (Grant No.: 2017FB092 ) and Australia ARC DECRA (No.: DE190100931 ).",,22106707,,January 2020,English,Heat transfer,,24,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Sustainable Cities and Society,Heat transfer mathematical model for a novel parabolic trough solar collecting system with V-shaped cavity absorber,Environmental conditions - Environmental factors - Experimental validations - Heat transfer characteristics - Heat transfer model - Parabolic trough solar collectors - Solar heat utilization - Thermal resistance networks,52
Adv. Intell. Sys. Comput.,"The side information plays an important role in video reconstruction for distributed compressed video sensing. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted KSVD dictionary learning based side information extraction method. First, the similarity between the non-key frame and its neighboring key frames is calculated in the measurement domain. According to the calculated similarities, different weighted factors are allocated to the motion estimation module to generate the side information. Then the dictionary is generated by the side information and KSVD algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existed non-weighted side information algorithm in terms of peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by 0.2–0.5 dB and visual perception. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",20192707144619,,"Jingmei, Zhao (1); Rui, Chen (2) ","(1) Yunnan Open University, Kunming City; Yunnan Province; 650223, China (2) Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing; Jiangsu Province; 211167, China ",,461.4 Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing,227569.0,"July 3, 2019 - July 5, 2019","Sydney, NSW, Australia","13th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing, IMIS 2019",Image compression - Image reconstruction - Image segmentation - Motion estimation - Signal to noise ratio - Web services,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Rui, Chen(chenrui@njity.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-030-22263-5_64,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783030222628.0,21945357,,2020,English,Ubiquitous computing,Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing - Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing IMIS-2019,17,675-681,1 of 1,2020,Springer Verlag,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Side Information Generation Algorithm Based on Weighted KSVD Dictionary,Compressive sensing - Dictionary learning - Peak signal to noise ratio - Side information extractions - Side information generations - Sparse representation - Video reconstruction - Visual perception,994
Chem. Eng. J.,"A novel adsorbent (UiO-66-TA) was presented by modifying metal-organic framework composites with thioctic acid. UiO-66-TA were characterized by fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), thermogravimetric (TG), Brunner-Emment-Teller (BET) measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which indicating that it had excellent morphology and specific surface area. The adsorption performances of UiO-66-TA for Au(III) were studied. The results showed that UiO-66-TA had a strong adsorption capacity under acidic conditions and the optimal pH was 2.0. Isotherm and kinetic adsorption were also conducted and found that the experimental values correspond to Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order isotherm model, indicating that the mechanism is mainly chemical adsorption on a uniform surface. Wastewater experiment showed that UiO-66-TA can be used for highly selective recovery Au(III) in actual life. The regeneration and thermodynamic experiments indicated that UiO-66-TA can be reused and were a spontaneous endothermic process. XPS analysis and the zeta potential proved that the main adsorption mechanisms were ion exchange and chelation. DFT calculation found that there are two ways to combine Au with S on UiO-66-TA and their distances are 2.38 Å and 2.39 Å, indicating that the gold and sulfur play a major role in chelation. In summary, UiO-66-TA was a hopeful adsorbent and could be used to collect gold ions from wastewater in a sustainability perspective. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193407349508,122511.0,"Wang, Chen (1, 2); Lin, Guo (4); Zhao, Jiling (1, 2); Wang, Shixing (1, 2); Zhang, Libo (1, 2); Xi, Yunhao (1, 2); Li, Xiteng (1, 2); Ying, Ying (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (4) School of Materials and Metallurgy, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan; Hubei; 430081, China ",CMEJAJ,452.3 Industrial Wastes - 547.1 Precious Metals - 601.3 Mechanisms - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.1 Probability Theory - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Adsorption - Carboxylic acids - Chelation - Coenzymes - Crystalline materials - Density functional theory - Field emission microscopes - Gold - Ion exchange - Isotherms - Mechanisms - Morphology - Organometallics - Scanning electron microscopy - Wastewater - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shixing(wsxkm@126.com) ",10.1016/j.cej.2019.122511,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: U1702252, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1702252).,,13858947,,15 January 2020,English,Gold compounds,,42,,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Chemical Engineering Journal,Highly selective recovery of Au(III) from wastewater by thioctic acid modified Zr-MOF: Experiment and DFT calculation,Adsorption capacities - Adsorption mechanism - Adsorption performance - Chemical adsorption - Experimental values - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Fourier transform infrared - Metal organic framework,380
Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"The application of fluorescent carbon dots in bio-imaging has huge positive significance in the field of biomedicine. By taking this advantage, herein we prepared nitrogen, sulfur and iodine doped carbon dots (N,S,I-CDs) by a facile hydrothermal reaction using C3N3S3, potassium iodate (KIO3) and ethylenediamine (EDA), and the obtained N,S,I-CDs show bright blue fluorescence with a high fluorescence quantum yield of about 32.4%. The prepared N, S, I-CDs could interact with the folic acid (FA) with high selectivity, lead to development of a high sensitive method for the FA detection from 0.1 to 175 μM wide linear range with a detection limit of 84 nM (S/N = 3) and also applied them in U-2 OS cells imaging. Moreover, this sensor possessed a good sensitivity, linearity and reversibility in the temperature range of 10–80 °C, and successfully applied for the temperature sensing in cell HT-29 samples. This investigation illustrates that as-prepared N, S, I-CDs probe may have great potential as a high-performance platform for the accurate recognition of temperature in cells and could provide a new tool for the detection of FA in cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193207275458,117444.0,"Mu, Zhao (1); Hua, Jianhao (1); Yang, Yaling (1) ","(1) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan Province; 650500, China ",SAMCAS,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 944.5 Temperature Measuring Instruments,,,,,Carbon - Cells - Chemical detection - Cytology - Energy transfer - Fluorescence - Iodine compounds - Organic acids - Potassium compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Yaling(yilyil8@163.com) ",10.1016/j.saa.2019.117444,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: 2018M20172118065, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; ","This study was supported by the Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( 2018M20172118065 ), Yunnan Province, China.

Water solubility of chrysin was promoted up to 4411.98 μg·mL−1 after formation of inclusion complexes with ACDs, better than that of β-CD and its derivatives, i.e., HP- and SBE-β-CD. In vitro antioxidant activity of chrysin was also improved after inclusion complexation by the DPPH scavenging assay. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity of solid inclusion complexes towards three human cancer cell lines, A549, HT-29 and HCT116 were enhanced significantly. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193707427771,110161.0,"Song, Shuang (1); Gao, Kai (1); Niu, Raomei (1, 2); Wang, Jin (3); Zhang, Jihong (4, 5); Gao, Chuanzhu (1); Yang, Bo (1); Liao, Xiali (1) ","(1) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Jiangsu Xinchen Pharmaceutical Co., LTD, Lianyungang; 222047, China (3) School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Bioresources of Saline Soils, Yancheng Teachers University, Yancheng; 224007, China (4) Faculty of Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (5) Research Centre for Pharmaceutical Care and Quality Management, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650500, China ",,461.9 Biology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 944.6 Temperature Measurements,,,,,Antioxidants - Cell culture - Chemical analysis - Cyclodextrins - Cytotoxicity - Differential scanning calorimetry - Flavonoids - Nuclear magnetic resonance - Scanning electron microscopy - Solubility - Suspensions (fluids) - X ray diffraction analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liao, Xiali(xialiliao@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.msec.2019.110161,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18730191.0,"Number: 21642001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81560601, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: BK20160443, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","This work was financial supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) (Nos. 21642001 & 81560601), Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects (Nos. 2018FB018 & 2018FA047) and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20160443), which are gratefully acknowledged.

Scripta Mater,"A martensitic transformation (MT) with paramagnetic behavior has been developed in Co50Fe2.5V31.5Ga16 quaternary Heusler alloy near room temperature. Accompanying the transformation, this alloy shows a good two-way shape memory effect, which results in a considerable relative volume change between two phases. Because of this, it has been also found that the MT is strongly sensitive to the applied hydrostatic pressure. By utilizing an indirectly estimated method, the obtained maximum reversible isothermal entropy (ΔST) and adiabatic temperature change (ΔTad) resulted from hydrostatic pressure induced MT, respectively, achieve ∼31 J/kg K and 6 K under 5 kbar, performing a large barocaloric effect. © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.",20194207544360,,"Liu, Hongwei (1, 2); Li, Zhe (2); Zhang, Yuanlei (2); Ni, Zhenting (1, 2); Xu, Kun (2); Liu, Yongsheng (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai; 200090, China (2) Center for Magnetic Materials and Devices and Key Laboratory for Advanced Functional and Low Dimensional Materials of Yunnan Higher Education Institute, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; 655011, China ",SCMAF7,531.2 Metallography - 543.6 Vanadium and Alloys - 545.2 Iron Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 631.1.1 Liquid Dynamics - 632.1 Hydraulics - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena,,,,,Cobalt alloys - Gallium alloys - Hydraulics - Hydrostatic pressure - Iron alloys - Paramagnetism - Vanadium alloys,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhe(zheli@mail.qjnu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.scriptamat.2019.10.003,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2018FA031, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 19020501000, Acronym: STCSM, Sponsor: Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; Number: 51861032, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 51661029 , 11674215 , 51861032 , 51971128 ).

Ecol. Model.,"Despite the great effort of nutrient loading reduction, lake rehabilitation often suffers from the impacts of internal nutrient cycling. However, the mechanisms of internal nutrient cycling, specifically the feedback of algal blooms on nutrients cycling is still an open question. Management of Lake Dianchi, the most eutrophic lake in China, has involved a series of costly measures but without significant algal bloom decreasing. In view of the difficulty to evaluate the importance of internal cycling only by monitoring data, a three-dimensional model-based flux tracking approach was performed to identify the contributions of internal cycling. The results highlighted the role of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) benthic fluxes with high seasonal fluctuations, contributing ∼29 %(N) and ∼18 %(P) of total input. The scenario analysis indicated that N loading reduction was more efficient for lake restoration. Furthermore, A positive feedback was detected between algae biomass and benthic P flux. Benthic P flux varied from adsorption to release when algae biomass increased. This phenomenon implied that a close link existed between N and P cycles with algae acting as a strong integrator. Due to the positive feedback loop between benthic P flux and algal blooms as well as the high efficiency of N loading reduction, controlling both N and P loadings will benefit lake restoration, especially eutrophic lakes with heavy sediment nutrient loadings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194707730804,108881.0,"Zou, Rui (1, 5, 6); Wu, Zhen (1, 7); Zhao, Lei (2); Elser, James J.

Appl Therm Eng,"It is hoped that horizontal liquid fuel spray burners can be better applied to small heating and heat transfer equipment in high-altitude areas. The morphology and temperature characteristics of diesel horizontal spray flame were investigated in a low-pressure chamber (0.05–0.10 MPa). The results show that when the air-fuel ratio is constant, the horizontal projection length of the and uplifted feature of the flame are proportional to the atmospheric pressure, which is completely contrary to the change rule when only the volume flow of air is kept constant. When the air-fuel ratio is constant, the flame trajectory at different atmospheric pressures can be normalized into two equations with 0.08 MPa as the dividing line. The dimensionless flame fluctuation length β can reveal the stability of the horizontal spray flame. An increase of β indicates that the diameter of the flame holder and swirling intensity need to be moderately increased at high altitudes. That is also confirmed from the perspective of the air entrainment coefficient. In addition, an accurate flame length prediction model is established. Dimensionless temperature analysis reveals that the air-fuel ratio needs to be closer to the stoichiometric ratio when compared with normal pressure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20194407593599,114555.0,"Xie, Kai (1); Cui, Yunjing (2); Qiu, Xingqi (1); Wang, Jianxin (3) ","(1) College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao; 266580, China (2) College of Electromechanical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao; 266580, China (3) Yunnan Aerospace Industry Co.

Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"Dried sclerotium of Macrohyporia cocos is a well-known and widely-consumed traditional Chinese medicine and is also used as dietary supplement. According to the differential treatment between cultivation and wild habitats in the market, the comparison and quantitative analysis of wild and cultivated M. cocos were performed using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and ultra-fast liquid chromatography combined with partial least squares discriminant analysis and partial least squares regression (PLSR). 636 samples were used for the spectral scan and chromatographic analysis. Results indicated that contents of dehydrotumulosic acid, poricoic acid A and dehydrotrametenolic acid in cultivated samples were significantly different from wild samples in two medicinal parts. Differences of dehydropachymic acid and pachymic acid just existed in inner part samples (P 95.14% efficiency using spectral data. ATR-FTIR combined with PLSR provided satisfactory performance for content predictions of poricoic acid A and dehydrotrametenolic acid. This study demonstrated that growth patterns could affect the quality of inner part and epidermis of M. cocos, and ATR-FTIR was a promising technique for the identification of wild and cultivated M. cocos and the rapid determination of triterpene acids contents. © 2019",20194107509773,117633.0,"Wang, Qinqin (1, 2); Zuo, Zhitian (1); Huang, Hengyu (2); Wang, Yuanzhong (1) ","(1) Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming; 650200, China (2) College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming; 650500, China ",SAMCAS,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 822.3 Food Products - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922 Statistical Methods,,,,,Chromatographic analysis - Dietary supplements - Discriminant analysis - Least squares approximations - Liquid chromatography - Medicine - Reflection - Spectrum analysis - Supersaturation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Hengyu(hhyhhy96@163.com) ",10.1016/j.saa.2019.117633,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 31860584, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31860584 and 31460538 ).

Mater Sci Semicond Process,"In this work, djembe like ZnO microstructures was successfully synthesized by surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method and its composite with g-C3N4 was prepared by an ethanolic reflux method for the first time. Moreover, the structural, morphological, electrical, optical properties and its photocatalytic activities were studied. The result revealed that the formation heterojunction between djembe like ZnO and g-C3N4, decreased the optical band gap energy thereby the light absorption was shifted towards visible region. The photocatalytic performance was studied by dye degradation experiment under visible light irradiation. The degradation efficiency of the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite for MB and RhB degradation was found to be ~95% and ~97% respectively, which is higher than that of the same for pure ZnO and g-C3N4. The scavenger studies indicated the active role of hydroxyl radicals in the degradation process. Furthermore, djembe like ZnO/g-C3N4 composite was successfully reused for five cycles of photodegradation without any drastic change in its activity and crystalline properties. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20194107501765,104754.0,"Prabhu, S.

J Am Ceram Soc,"Making illumination light sources become comfortable to the human eye is a long-term effort, which justifies the current research on warm white-light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs). In this work, a novel phosphor for w-LEDs, namely SrGa12O19: Dy3+(SGO: Dy3+), with a low-color temperature (CT) was designed and synthesized. The crystal structure, the luminescence properties, the thermoluminescence properties and the stability of SGO: Dy3+ were investigated. We demonstrate outstanding luminescent characteristics and excellent stabilities. The intensity of emission light keep remained when excited by a flickering light source with a chopping speed or off-time of a few seconds, which indicates that the SGO: Dy3+ phosphor has anti-flicker properties that will be useful for potential applications, as LEDs driven by alternating current (AC-LED). The chromaticity coordinates and the correlated color temperature (CCT) of SGO: Dy3+ phosphors with different Dy3+ concentrations are close with an optimal doping at 4.00 mol% Dy3+ for chromaticity coordinate (0.4269, 0.4348) and a lowest CCT of 3361 K. The perfect weatherability of this phosphor was also confirmed since the phosphorescence intensity and the color were stable at high temperature and in a high humidity environment. The performance obtained shows that SGO: Dy3+ is a suitable candidate for illumination sources that are beneficial to human health. © 2019 The American Ceramic Society",20193507362601,,"Lai, Junan (1); Long, Zhangwen (1); Qiu, Jianbei (1, 2); Zhou, Dacheng (1, 2); Zhou, Junhe (1); Zhu, Congcong (1); Hu, Songhan (1); Zhang, Ke (1); Wang, Qi (3, 4) ","(1) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (2) Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China (3) Analytic and Testing Research Center of Yunnan, Kunming, China (4) Research Center for Analysis and Measurement, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China ",JACTAW,714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Color - Crystal structure - Defects - Light - Luminescence - Phosphors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Qiu, Jianbei(qiu@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1111/jace.16733,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15512916.0,"Number: 2016FB081, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: KKSY201632046, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 11774138, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11774138, 11664022, 51862020, 11804255, and 11664022), the Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FA021 and 2016FB081), and the project for personal training fun supported by Kunming University of Science and Technology (KKSY201632046).",,00027820,1.0,"January 1, 2020",English,Light emitting diodes,,45,335-345,,2020,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,Warm white light emitting from single composition SrGa12O19:Dy3+ phosphors for AC-LED,Chromaticity coordinates - Correlated color temperature - High-humidity environment - Luminescence properties - Luminescent characteristics - Phosphorescence intensity - Thermoluminescence properties - White light emitting diodes,103

Ecol. Indic.,"In the context of global warming, extreme drought events have occurred more frequently and this is projected to continue in the future in many parts of the world. However, their ecological consequences on shallow lakes are not well studied. Here we compare the succession of diatom assemblages of two medium-sized shallow lakes in southwest China during the past ~70 years, comprising an extreme drought event between ~2009 and ~2013. The diatom community of Lake Chahei showed a clear response to eutrophication from ~1980. The pioneer species Achnanthes minutissima increased strongly with elevated sedimentary total nitrogen content and at the expense of Epithemia sorex. In contrast, the diatom community of Lake Yuxian was stable and constantly dominated by the Fragilaria construens/pinnata complex. For both lakes, the most striking change occurred with the extreme drought event when environmental conditions and diatom compositions were homogenised. With strongly shrinking lake areas, peaks in the proportion of silt were observed in the sediments, suggesting increased particle burial rates and decreased light availability. These conditions selected for motile and presumably heterotrophic species mainly of the genera Navicula and Nitzschia which exhibited abrupt increases in their relative abundances at both lakes. Meanwhile, the degree of community homogeneity (inferred by Jaccard's similarity index) of the formerly distinct diatom assemblages increased strongly between both lakes. Hence, the extreme drought event has overridden and homogenised previous abiotic conditions and led to a decrease in beta diversity between the two study sites. Navicula and Nitzschia species may be reliable (paleo)indicators for extreme drought events in comparable shallow lake systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193807447965,105662.0,"Klamt, Anna-Marie (1); Hu, Kui (1); Huang, Linpei (1); Chen, Xiaolin (1); Liu, Xiaolong (1); Chen, Guangjie (1) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Plateau Geographical Processes and Environment Change, School of Tourism and Geography, Yunnan Normal University, 768 Juxian St., Kunming; 650500, China ",,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Drought - Eutrophication - Global warming - Homogenization method - Paleolimnology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Guangjie(guangjiechen@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105662,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2017YFA0605202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research; Number: 41771239, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are grateful to the comments of two reviewers that helped to improve a previous version of this manuscript.

Inf. Fusion,"Due to importantly beneficial effects on physical and mental health and strong association with many rehabilitation programs, Physical Activity Recognition and Measure (PARM) has been widely recognised as a key paradigm for a variety of smart healthcare applications. Traditional methods for PARM relies on designing and utilising Data fusion or machine learning techniques in processing ambient and wearable sensing data for classifying types of physical activity and removing their uncertainties. Yet they mostly focus on controlled environments with the aim of increasing types of identifiable activity subjects, improved recognition accuracy and measure robustness. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabling technology is transferring PARM studies to an open and dynamic uncontrolled ecosystem by connecting heterogeneous cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps and various groups of users [35]. Little is currently known about whether traditional Data fusion techniques can tackle new challenges of IoT environments and how to effectively harness and improve these technologies. In an effort to understand potential use and opportunities of Data fusion techniques in IoT enabled PARM applications, this paper will give a systematic review, critically examining PARM studies from a perspective of a novel 3D dynamic IoT based physical activity collection and validation model. It summarized traditional state-of-the-art data fusion techniques from three plane domains in the 3D dynamic IoT model: devices, persons and timeline. The paper goes on to identify some new research trends and challenges of data fusion techniques in the IoT enabled PARM studies, and discusses some key enabling techniques for tackling them. © 2019",20193807456395,,"Qi, Jun (1, 2); Yang, Po (3); Newcombe, Lee (2); Peng, Xiyang (1); Yang, Yun (1); Zhao, Zhong (4) ","(1) Department of Software Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Department of Computer Science, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom (3) Department of Computer Science, Sheffield University, Sheffield, United Kingdom (4) Department of Neurology, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,"461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 903.2 Information Dissemination - 911.2 Industrial Economics",,,,,Application programs - Cost effectiveness - Data fusion - Dynamics - Health - Information fusion - Learning systems - Pattern recognition - Reviews - Three dimensional computer graphics - Wearable technology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Qi, Jun(ruth1012@live.com) ",10.1016/j.inffus.2019.09.002,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,15662535,,March 2020,English,Internet of things,,97,269-280,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Information Fusion,An overview of data fusion techniques for Internet of Things enabled physical activity recognition and measure,Activity monitoring - Activity recognition - Health care application - Internet of thing (IOT) - Lifelogging - Machine learning techniques - Physical activity - Rehabilitation programs,55
Food Chem.,"A pure glycoprotein (BGP4-I) was obtained from tartary buckwheat seeds by aqueous extraction followed by DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography. The average molecular weight of BGP4-I, as determined by high performance gel permeation chromatography, was 123.43 kDa. The structure of BGP4-I was characterized based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, etc. Based on the nano-liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the amino acid sequence of BGP4-I, belongs unequivocally to the glycosyl hydrolase family 1 in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database by alignment studies. The specific activity of BGP4-I was 18.44 μmol/min/mg on the substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside. Furthermore, BGP4-I is unique in its specificity for some substrates. These results suggest that the BGP4-I from tartary buckwheat seeds is a novel specific β-glucosidase setting the foundation for potential applications in the food industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20194407593753,125671.0,"Zhou, Yuhui (1); Ma, Yanli (1); Li, Lirong (1); Yang, Xilian (1) ","(1) Yunnan Food Safety Research Institute, Kunming University of Science and Technology, 727 Jingming South Road, Chenggong District, Yunnan; 650500, China ",FOCHDJ,461.9 Biology - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Chromatographic analysis - Circular dichroism spectroscopy - Crops - Dichroism - Drug products - Electrospray ionization - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Gel permeation chromatography - Glycoproteins - Ion chromatography - Ion exchange - Mass spectrometry - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Substrates,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Lirong(lilirong-lily@126.com) ",10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.125671,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18737072.0,"Number: 31460424, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The author especially thank for valuable and critical comments by the teachers I met.

Chemosphere,"This study investigated the effects of microcystin (MC) on the regulation of thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism in juvenile zebrafish exposed to MC-LR. The results showed that acute MC-LR exposure at concentrations ranging from 50 μg/L to 400 μg/L led to significant reductions in thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels in juvenile zebrafish. The transcription levels of genes involved in TH synthesis, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh), thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), thyroid peroxidase (tpo) and transthyretin (ttr), were significantly decreased followed by an increase after MC-LR exposure. Transcription of the TH nuclear receptors (tr-α and tr-β) was significantly reduced during the exposure period. Moreover, the activities of iodothyronine deiodinase type (ID1) and iodothyronine deiodinase type (ID2) showed initially decreased and then increased trend, while the activity of iodothyronine deiodinase type (ID3) significantly decreased during MC-LR exposure. In addition, the effect of MC-LR on deiodinase activities and T4 contents were important causes of the decreased T3 at the early exposure stage. These results indicated that acute MC-LR exposure significantly interfered with the transcription of genes related to TH synthesis, transport and metabolism, and affected normal function of the thyroid which leads to decrease of T4 and T3 in juvenile zebrafish. Therefore, the thyroid function is susceptible to interference by MC-LR, and it may cause adverse effects on the growth and development of juvenile zebrafish. © 2019",20194207550707,125037.0,"Hu, Qing (1); Liu, Zidong (2); Gao, Yu (1); Jia, Dan (1); Tang, Rong (3); Li, Li (3); Li, Dapeng (3) ","(1) Faculty of Animal Science and Technology, Plateau Aquacultural College, Yunnan Agricultural University, Yunnan; 650201, China (2) Wuhan Fisheries Technology Extension and Instruction Center, Wuhan; 430012, China (3) College of Fisheries, Hubei Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Pond Aquaculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan; 430070, China ",CMSHAF,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology,,,,,Hormones - Metabolism,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Dapeng(ldp@mail.hzau.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125037,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18791298.0,"Number: CARS-45, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System; Number: 31670521, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31602141, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","This work was supported by the Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System ( CARS-45 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (project number: 31670521 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 2662015PY119 ), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (project number: 31602141 ).",,00456535,,February 2020,English,Transcription,,43,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Chemosphere,"Waterborne exposure to microcystin-LR alters thyroid hormone levels, iodothyronine deiodinase activities, and gene transcriptions in juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio)",Corticotropin-releasing hormone - Gene transcriptions - Growth and development - Iodothyronine - Thyroid hormones - Thyroid stimulating hormones - Waterborne exposure - Zebrafish,241
Earth Plan. Sci. Lett.,"Precipitation stable isotopes preserve historic changes of evaporation in the source regions and precipitation processes, therefore, they can be used to reveal regional hydrological cycle dynamics and paleoclimate reconstructions. In monsoon regions, strong inverse impacts of convection on precipitation isotope ratios, have created a debate regarding the interpretation of isotope records as local climate proxies. The proportions of stratiform to convective precipitation on water isotopes, together with the influence mechanisms on seasonal and interannual scales remain highly uncertain. To further address the influence of precipitation patterns on water isotopes, we used 10 yrs of precipitation isotope data from the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP) to explore the effects of large-scale cloud cover and local climate on precipitation isotopes. Correlation analysis performed between local precipitation δ18O values and different level cloud data, indicated significant negative correlations between precipitation isotopes and high level cloud cover on both seasonal and interannual time scales. This result suggests that high-level convection in the upper moisture transport stream is a main control on precipitation isotopes in the southern TP. The clear and coherent variations of precipitation isotopes with the Southern Oscillation Index and outgoing longwave radiation confirmed that strong convection activity in the moisture source region and during transport significantly depleted heavy isotopes in vapor, producing substantially decreased precipitation δ18O in the study region. These results agree with earlier findings of tree ring cellulose isotope records that correlate with cloud cover, but we emphasized the important role of larger-scale regional cloud cover. We also delineated different maximum correlation zones for seasonal and interannual time scales, likely due to different mechanisms. These findings further improve the interpretation of paleoisotope records from the Indian summer monsoon region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194107501884,115837.0,"Wang, Di (1, 2); Tian, Lide (1, 2, 3); Cai, Zhongyin (1, 2); Shao, Lili (1, 2); Guo, Xiaoyu (4); Tian, Ran (1, 2); Li, Yike (1, 2); Chen, Yiliang (1, 2); Yuan, Chuan (1, 2) ","(1) Institute of International Rivers and Eco-security, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory of International Rivers and Transboundary Eco-security, Kunming; 650500, China (3) CAS Center for Excellence in Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China (4) Key Laboratory of Tibetan Environment Changes and Land Surface Processes, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China ",,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 443.3 Precipitation,,,,,Atmospheric pressure - Atmospheric thermodynamics - Isotopes - Moisture,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tian, Lide(ldtian@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.epsl.2019.115837,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 41530748, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41661144044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41771043, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge NOAA Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) for provision of the OLR and SOI data.

Appl Surf Sci,"RuOx/TiO2 and RuOx/TiO2-SO42− catalysts were prepared and used for selective catalytic oxidation of ammonia (NH3-SCO). The results indicated that N2 selectivity over RuOx/TiO2 was significantly enhanced after the introduction of SO42−. The introduction of SO42− into RuOx/TiO2 observably increased the amount and strength of acid species on the surface of catalyst. Specifically, the RuOx/TiO2-SO42− sulfated treatment at 2 h possessed the optimal surface acidic property obtaining more than 85% N2 selectivity at 300 °C, which was apparently higher than that of RuOx/TiO2 with 66% N2 selectivity. The strong interaction between sulfated support and RuOx resulted in excellent redox property at high temperature, abundant surface oxygen and more Ru4+ species. Particularly, DRIFTS and NH3-TPD illustrated that the increased N2-selectivity was put down to Brönsted and Lewis acid sites augmented via sulfating treatment of TiO2, promoting the dehydrogenation of adsorbed ammonia species on the catalyst surface, then the formation of more [sbnd]NH2 species could facilitate the reduction of NO to harmless N2, meanwhile, the generation of HNO species also were reduced to N2 by NH. Therefore, the excellent acid properties of RuOx/TiO2-SO42− gave rise to the formation of few nitrate species with an iSCR mechanism, which ensured to the high N2 selectivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194107526383,144044.0,"Zhang, Qiulin (1); Zhang, Tengxiang (1); Xia, Futing (2); Zhang, Yaqing (1); Wang, Huimin (1); Ning, Ping (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Key Laboratory of Resource Clean Conversion in Ethnic Regions, Education Department of Yunnan, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China ",ASUSEE,803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Ammonia - Catalytic oxidation - Ruthenium compounds - Titanium dioxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Qiulin(qiulinzhang_kmust@163.com) ",10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.144044,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 21307047, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21567030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21307047 and No. 21567030).,,01694332,,15 January 2020,English,Catalyst selectivity,,65,,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Applied Surface Science,Promoting effects of acid enhancing on N2 selectivity for selectivity catalytic oxidation of NH3 over RuOx/TiO2: The mechanism study,Acidic properties - Catalyst surfaces - DRIFTS - Mechanism studies - NH3-SCO - Selective catalytic oxidation - Strong interaction - Surface acidity,500
Neurocomputing,"Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is one of the most essential tasks in LBSNs to help users discover new interesting locations, especially when users travel out of town or to unfamiliar areas. Current studies on POI recommendation in LBSNs mainly focus on modeling multiple factors extracted from users’ profiles and checking-in records. Data sparsity and incompleteness of user-POI interaction matrix are very common problems in POI recommendation, especially for the out-of-town scenario. Another challenge is that most information in the LBSNs is unreliable due to users’ different backgrounds or preferences. Because of the close relationship between users, information from trustable friends on Communication-Based Social Networks (CBSNs) is more valuable than that in LBSNs, which can give a preferable suggestion instead of trustless reviews in LBSNs. In this study, we propose a latent probabilistic generative model called HI-LDA (Heterogeneous Information based LDA), which can accurately capture users’ words on CBSNs by taking into full consideration the information on LBSNs including geographical effect as well as the abundant information including social relationship, users’ interactive behaviors and comment content. In particular, the parameters of the HI-LDA model can be inferred by the Gibbs sampling method in an effective fashion. Beyond these proposed techniques, we introduce an POI recommendation framework integrating geographical clustering approach considering the locations and popularity of POIs simultaneously. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on two real heterogeneous LBSN-CBSN networks. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HI-LDA on effective and efficient POI recommendation in both home-town and out-of-town scenarios, when compared with the state-of-the-art baseline approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194007489894,,"Xiong, Xi (1); Qiao, Shaojie (2); Han, Nan (3); Xiong, Fei (4); Bu, Zhan (5); Li, Rong-Hua (6); Yue, Kun (7); Yuan, Guan (8) ","(1) School of Cybersecurity, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu; 610225, China (2) School of Software Engineering, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu; 610225, China (3) School of Management, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu; 610103, China (4) School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing; 100044, China (5) College of Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics, Nanjing; 210023, China (6) School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing; 100081, China (7) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650500, China (8) School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou; 221116, China ",NRCGEO,723.5 Computer Applications,,,,,Beryllium compounds - Heterogeneous networks - Location,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Han, Nan(hannan@cuit.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.neucom.2019.09.060,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18728286.0,"Number: KYTZ201750, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018GXNSFDA138005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province; Number: 2019YFG0106, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; Number: 17YJCZH202, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; Number: J201701, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61772091 61802035, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 18TD0027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61772091 61802035 and 61962006 the Youth Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China under Grant No. 17YJCZH202; the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant Nos. 2018JY0448 , 2019YFG0106 , 2019YFS0067 and 2018GZ0253 ; the Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi under Grant No. 2018GXNSFDA138005; the Innovative Research Team Construction Plan in Universities of Sichuan Province under Grant No. 18TD0027; the Scientific Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Chengdu University of Information Technology under Grant Nos.

Chem. Eng. Res. Des.,"Ionic liquid-based polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) are an environmentally benign separation technology. PIMs are especially suitable for separation of dilute substances, but their application is hindered by their relatively low permeability rate. In this paper, a novel ionic liquid-based PIM system integrated with an electroplating unit was developed to improve the permeability of gold from aurocyanide solutions. Under the optimal conditions, 98.6% of gold(I) was transported, and more than 96.4% of gold was simultaneously deposited on the copper cathode. The gold(I) transport rate was considerably enhanced with in-situ electrodeposition of gold in the stripping phase. With a constant voltage of 1.50 V applied to the stripping solution, the permeability coefficient increased from 9.25 × 10−6 m/s (with no voltage) to 21.5 × 10−6 m/s (with voltage). SEM and EDX analysis show metallic state gold was coated evenly on the surface of the electrode. Results of a stability evaluation experiment show that the PIM can be operated stably for 10 cycles on a continuous run mode. The method of simultaneous transport and in-situ electrodeposition expands the application of the PIM technology for separation, which shows good prospects for the removal and recovery metal ions. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers",20194607667419,,"Sun, Yan (1); Wang, Ziyue (1); Wang, Yating (1); Liu, Men (1); Li, Shengjian (1); Tang, Lihong (1); Wang, Shixiong (1); Yang, Xiangjun (1); Ji, Siping (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource (Yunnan University), Ministry Education, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",CERDEE,"504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 531.1 Metallurgy - 539.3.1 Electroplating - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 813.2 Coating Materials - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Electrodeposition - Electrodes - Electroplating solutions - Gold coatings - Gold deposits - Hydrophobicity - Ionic liquids - Mechanical permeability - Metal ions - Metal recovery - Metals - Polymers - Separation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Xiangjun(yxjun@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.cherd.2019.10.040,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2019HA005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2017-1-S-12305, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51464044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are thankful for the financial supports provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51464044 ), Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (no. 2017YDQN01 ), and Free exploration fund for academician ( 2019HA005 ) and the Key Natural Science Foundation of Kunming ( 2017-1-S-12305 ).",,02638762,,January 2020,English,Gold compounds,,54,136-145,,2020,Institution of Chemical Engineers,Chemical Engineering Research and Design,Improved transport of gold(I) from aurocyanide solution using a green ionic liquid-based polymer inclusion membrane with in-situ electrodeposition,Alkaline cyanide solution - Environmentally benign - Optimal conditions - Polymer inclusion membranes - Polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) - Removal and recoveries - Separation technologies - [A336][SCN],153
Chem. Eng. J.,"Photolysis is one of the main pathways for 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) removal in natural systems. Organic matter in the effluent from biological wastewater treatment facilities contains abundant photosensitive substances, which could play an important role in the photodegradation of micropollutants such as ethinylestradiol. In order to explore the source of such photosensitive substances, extracellular and intracellular polymeric substances from aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were tested for their ability to photodegrade EE2 under anaerobic conditions. Degradation was promoted at higher concentrations of the extracts, except for the extracellular polymers from anaerobic cultivation. The contribution of triplet state substances was more important than that of singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radical. The contributions of various triplet state substances were strongly correlated with their quantum yield coefficients. The fluorescence intensity values of the proteins and amino acids were in line with the observed photodegradation rates mediated by the four cellular polymers. Proteins or amino acids may play an important role in the production of triplet state substances. This study has suggested the sources of photosensitive substances in effluent organic matter and could further explain the fate of estrogens in natural photodegradation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193707426401,122737.0,"He, Huan (1, 2); Han, Fengxia (1); Sun, Shijie (1); Deng, Hongyu (1); Huang, Bin (1, 3); Pan, Xuejun (1, 3); Dionysiou, Dionysios D.

The excellent gas-sensing properties of sensor towards formaldehyde may attribute to the unique 1D fiber-like structure, large specific surface area and the additive of Cd, which can provide more active sites for the reaction between adsorbed oxygen ions and formaldehyde molecules on the surface of sensing materials. In addition, based on the above experimental results, the possible sensing mechanism of sensor towards formaldehyde is discussed in detail. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20193707422905,152170.0,"Zhao, Rongjun (1); Zhang, Xu (1); Peng, Sijia (1); Hong, Ping (1); Zou, Tong (1); Wang, Zidong (1); Xing, Xinxin (1); Yang, Yue (2); Wang, Yude (1, 3) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Key Lab of Quantum Information of Yunnan Province, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",JALCEU,641.1 Thermodynamics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Chemical detection - Chemical sensors - Formaldehyde - Gas detectors - Nanofibers - Specific surface area - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152170,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2017FA025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 41876055, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61761047, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61761047and 41876055), the Department of Science and Technology of Yunnan Province via the Key Project for the Science and Technology (Grant No.2017FA025) and Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Yunnan Province.",,09258388,,15 January 2020,English,Cadmium compounds,,39,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,Shaddock peels as bio-templates synthesis of Cd-doped SnO2 nanofibers: A high performance formaldehyde sensing material,Cd-doped - Formaldehyde-sensing - Gas sensing properties - Hydrothermal methods - Large specific surface areas - Low operating temperature - Operating temperature - Synthesized materials,813
Adv. Intell. Sys. Comput.,"Dongba hieroglyph is a kind of very primitive picture hieroglyphs. Its picture features allow us to analyse the overall and local features of Dongba characters in combination with the existing feature extraction, simplification and segmentation algorithms for shape in computer vision. Moreover, the analysis of the local features of Dongba hieroglyphs play an important role in the study of Dongba hieroglyph’s writing, the evolution process of hieroglyphs and the comparison between similar hieroglyphs. Therefore, in this paper, we first use the Chain-Code Based Connected Domain Priority Marking Algorithm (CDPM) and the Discrete Curve Evolution Algorithm (DCE) to obtain the simplified feature curve of Dongba hieroglyph. Then, we focus on the selection and adjustment of demarcation points and local curve segmentation. And, the experiment proves that our method can further correct the potential errors in the curve segmentation, which is helpful to improve the correct rate of hieroglyph’s local feature extraction. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",20191906902755,,"Yang, Yuting (1); Kang, Houliang (2) ","(1) Culture and Tourism College, Yunnan Open University, Kunming; Yunnan, China (2) College of Humanities and Art, Yunnan College of Business Management, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,802.3 Chemical Operations,225489.0,"August 17, 2018 - August 19, 2018","Shanghai, China","8th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Networks, CENet 2018",Computer networks - Extraction - Feature extraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Yuting(tudou-yeah@163.com) ",10.1007/978-3-030-14680-1_55,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,This research was partially supported by the Scientific Research Fund of Yunnan Education Department (2018JS748).,9783030146795.0,21945357,,2020,English,Evolutionary algorithms,"The 8th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Networks, CENet 2018",16,504-512,1 of 1,2020,Springer Verlag,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Adjustment and correction demarcation points in dongba hieroglyphic feature curves segmentation,Curve segmentation - Demarcation points adjustment - Discrete curve evolution - Evolution process - Feature curves - Local feature extraction - Marking algorithm - Segmentation algorithms,905
Chemosphere,"Methylmercury (MeHg) in rice has attracted growing health concern over the past decade, due to the accumulation of high MeHg levels, which may pose potential health risk to humans. Rice is the staple food in Sri Lanka; nevertheless, the presence of micro pollutants, such as MeHg has been not investigated. Therefore, commercial rice samples from the Sri Lankan market (n = 163) were measured to reveal the total mercury (THg) and MeHg levels. THg (mean: 1.73 ± 0.89 ng/g, range: 0.21–6.13 ng/g) and MeHg concentrations (mean: 0.51 ± 0.37 ng/g; range: 0.03–3.81 ng/g) were low. Compared to the fish MeHg exposure, the rice MeHg exposure was generally lower in different consumption groups, suggesting that rice plays a less role than fish in MeHg exposure in Sri Lanka. Babies (infants and toddlers) at one year old may face fish MeHg exposure (0.17 μg/kg bw/day) higher than the reference dose for MeHg (RfD)-0.1 μg/kg bw/day, which was more than 5 times that of rice MeHg exposure (0.031 μg/kg bw/day). Future studies in Sri Lanka should focus on health impacts under long-term overexposure of MeHg, especially in vulnerable populations. Some diet changes should be made to mitigate MeHg exposure levels in Sri Lankans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193707418231,124749.0,"Xu, Xiaohang (1, 2); Han, Jialiang (1, 2); Abeysinghe, Kasun S.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","The development of metal oxide based high-performance methane (CH4) sensors working at room temperature remains a challenge. In this work, we present a novel visible light photocatalysis-enhanced sensor based on Pd nanoparticle-decorated ZnO/rGO hybrids, enabling high-performance detection of CH4 at room temperature under visible-light illumination. A systematical comparison study indicated that the sensor based on the ternary hybrids exhibited highest p-type responses and fastest response/recovery rates to CH4 at room temperature under 470 nm visible light illumination. The sensor responses varied from 6.3% to 63.4% toward CH4 concentrations of 25 ppm to 1%, and the response and recovery time at 1% CH4 were 74 and 78 s, respectively. Moreover, the sensor exhibited full reversibility, low detection limit, long-term stability as well as excellent selectivity at room temperature. Photocatalytic measurements revealed that the CH4 sensing performances of the hybrids could be well-correlated with their photocatalytic CH4 oxidation activities under visible-light illumination. The superior room temperature CH4 sensing performance of the ternary hybrids under visible light illumination was then attributed to the synergetic effects of visible light-active Pd nanoparticles as the catalytic promoter, the efficient charge transfer rendered by rGO nanosheets as well as the multiple heterojunctions formed within the hybrids. The presently developed ternary hybrid design and the visible light photocatalysis-enhancement strategy open facile pathways to the fabrication of high-performance CH4 sensors working at room temperature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",20194807741461,127334.0,"Xia, Yi (1, 2); Wang, Jing (3); Xu, Lei (4); Li, Xian (5); Huang, Shaojun (1, 2) ","(1) Research Center for Analysis and Measurement, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Analytic& Testing Research Center of Yunnan, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Synthetic and Biological Colloids, Ministry of Education, School of Chemical and Material Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi; 214122, China (4) Faculty of Metallurgical & Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (5) Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Agricultural Information Service Technology of Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing; 100081, China ",SABCEB,535.2.2 Metal Forming Practice - 547.1 Precious Metals - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Charge transfer - Heterojunctions - II-VI semiconductors - Metal working - Methane - Nanoparticles - Palladium - Photocatalytic activity - Precious metals - Zinc oxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Jing(jingwang@jiangnan.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.snb.2019.127334,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: B13025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018ZE027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi; Number: 2019J0034, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Scientific Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department; Number: KKSY201732033, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 2018T20110222, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: JUSRP11816, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: BK20180630, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: 51864030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51802123 , 51522405 , 51864030 ), Yunnan Science and Technology Major Project ( 2018ZE008 and 2018ZE027 ), and Scientific Research Fund of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( KKZ3201752046 and KKSY201732033 ), Scientific Research Fund of Yunnan Education Department ( 2019J0034 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20180630 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( JUSRP11816 ), Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( 2018T20110222 ).Financial support from MOE & SAFEA for the 111 project ( B13025 ), is also gratefully acknowledged.

Ceram Int,"Herein, we fabricated mesoporous ternary hybrids composed of Au-functionalized ZnO nanorods grown on rGO nanosheets. The ZnO nanorods distributed on the rGO nanosheets can act as a pillaring layer to avoid the agglomeration of rGO, leading to the formation of abundant mesopores within the hybrids. The high-surface-area, mesoporous hybrids can offer sufficient active sites and transport channels for efficient adsorption and diffusion of Cr(VI), which was favorable for its photocatalytic reduction due to the adsorption enrichment effects. Moreover, the plasmonic-induced visible-light absorption of Au nanoparticles and efficient charge separation by rGO synergistically contributed to the significantly improved solar-light-driven photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction properties of the ternary hybrids. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",20193807447370,,"Xia, Yi (1, 2, 3); Gang, Ruiqi (1, 2, 3); Xu, Lei (3); Huang, Shaojun (1, 2); Zhou, Liexing (1, 2); Wang, Jing (4) ","(1) Research Center for Analysis and Measurement, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Analytic & Testing Research Center of Yunnan, Kunming; 650093, China (3) The Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (4) Key Laboratory of Synthetic and Biological Colloids, Ministry of Education, School of Chemical and Material Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi; 214122, China ",CINNDH,547.1 Precious Metals - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Adsorption - Gold compounds - Gold nanoparticles - II-VI semiconductors - Light - Light absorption - Mesoporous materials - Nanorods - Nanosheets - Photocatalytic activity - Plasmonic nanoparticles - Plasmonics - Precious metals - Solar energy - Zinc oxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xia, Yi(xiayi0125@qq.com) ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.115,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: B13025, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2018ZE027, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi; Number: KKSY201732033, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 2018T20110222, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: JUSRP11816, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Number: BK20180630, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Number: 51864030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51802123 , 51522405 , 51864030 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20180630 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( JUSRP11816 ), Yunnan Science and Technology Major Project ( 2018ZE008 and 2018ZE027 ), Scientific Research Fund of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( KKZ3201752046 and KKSY201732033 ), Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( 2018T20110222 ).

Waste Manage.,"Two thermal fields, namely, microwave assistance and traditional heating, were used in this study to extract valuable Ti mineral resources from industrial solid waste (i.e., coal gangue) through acid leaching. Moreover, leaching extraction differences between the two thermal fields were analyzed. The leaching optimization experiment in different thermal fields revealed that the microwave power, acid-to-gangue ratio, and microwave radiation time under the microwave thermal field were 800 W, 1.5, and 1.25 h, respectively; the Ti leaching rate in coal gangue under these conditions reached 81.25%. By contrast, the heating temperature, acid-to-gangue ratio, and heating time under the traditional thermal field were 170 °C, 1.4, and 4 h, respectively; the Ti leaching rate in coal gangue under these conditions reached 91.83%. Characterization analysis demonstrated that the phase compositions of Ti in acid-leached coal gangue under the microwave thermal field were Ti2H2(SO4)4·5H2O and H2Ti3O7, whereas those under the traditional thermal field were H2TiO3 and Ti2(SO4)3. Ti-containing compounds were detected from acid leaching residue under the microwave thermal field, whereas those under the traditional thermal field were mainly silicon oxide and calcium sulfate. The SEM graph of acid leaching residue also reflected microstructural differences in acid leaching residue under the microwave and traditional thermal fields.

Adv. Intell. Sys. Comput.,"In order to predict the crime in YD county, data mining and machine learning are used in this paper. The aim of the study is to show the pattern and rate of crime in YD county based on the data collected and to show the relationships that exist among the various crime types and crime Variable. Analyzing this data set can provide insight on crime activities within YD county. By introducing formula and methods of Bayesian network, random tree and neural network in machine learning and big data, to analyze the crime rules from the collected data. According to the statistics released by the YD county From 2012-09-01 to 2015-07-21, The crime of smuggling, selling, transporting and manufacturing drugs, Theft, Intentional injury, Illegal business crime, Illegal possession of drugs, Rape, Crime of fraud, Gang fighting, manslaughter, Robbery made the top ten list of crime types with high number of crimes. The crime rate of drugs was the highest, reaching 46.86%, farmers are the majority, accounting for 97.07%, people under the age of 35 are the subject of crime. Males accounted for 90.17% of crimes committed, while females accounted for 9.83%. For ethnic groups, the top five were han, yi, wa, dai and lang, accounting for 68.43%, 23.43%, 1.88%, 1.67% and 1.25% respectively. By adopting random forest, Bayesian networks, and neural network methods, we obtained the decision rules for criminal variables. By comparison, the classification effect of Random Trees is better than that of Neural Networks and Bayesian Networks. Through the data collection of the three algorithms, the validity and accuracy of the random tree algorithm in predicting crime data are observed. The performance of the Bayesian network algorithm is relatively poor, probably due to the existence of certain random factors in various crimes and related features (the correlation between the three algorithms is low). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",20191906902738,,"Wu, Shaobing (1); Wang, Changmei (2); Cao, Haoshun (1); Jia, Xueming (1) ","(1) Institute of Information Security, Yunnan Police College, Kunming; 650223, China (2) Solar Energy Institute, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",,"723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 971 Social Sciences",225489.0,"August 17, 2018 - August 19, 2018","Shanghai, China","8th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Networks, CENet 2018",Bayesian networks - Computer networks - Data mining - Decision trees - Forecasting - Learning systems - Machine learning,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Changmei(823804919@qq.com) ",10.1007/978-3-030-14680-1_40,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,This study is supported by scientific research projects of National Social Science Foundation (13CFX038).

Opt Lasers Eng,"An optical method for measuring concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients of binary solution is introduced in this paper. The concentration spatial and temporal profiles (Ce(z, t)s) are obtained from a single experiment using an asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens. The concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient is assumed to be a polynomial D(C) = D0 × (1 + α1C + α2C2 + α3C3 + …), where D0 is diffusion coefficient in infinite dilute solution, α1, α2 and α3 are under-determined parameters. The finite difference method (FDM) is applied to solve numerically Fick diffusion equation, the calculated concentration profiles (Cn(z, t)s) by varying the under-determined parameters are compared with the profile Ce(z, t), the parameters(α1, α2, α3, …) corresponding the minimum concentration standard deviation are selected to determine D(C). To verify the proposed method, we have carried out the diffusion experiment of ethylene glycol aqueous solution, the obtained concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with literature values. On the other hand, the obtained polynomial D(C) has been used to calculate refractive index profiles (nn(z, t)s). Based on the nn(z, t)s, ray tracing method has been applied to simulate the diffusion images, which fit the experimental images very well over a wider range of diffusion time, demonstrating that the proposed method is reliable in rapidly measuring concentration-dependent liquid diffusion coefficients with high accuracy and stability. © 2019",20194007492877,105867.0,"Wei, Li (1); Meng, Weidong (1, 2); Chen, Yan (1); He, Bo (1); Zhou, Qing (1); Pu, Xiaoyun (1, 2) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Key Lab of Quantum Information of Yunnan Province, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",OLENDN,502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.1 Algebra - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Finite difference method - Lenses - Liquids - Optical data processing - Polynomials - Ray tracing - Refractive index - Solution mining,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pu, Xiaoyun(xypu@163.com) ",10.1016/j.optlaseng.2019.105867,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 11804296, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant no. 11804296), Joint Key Project of Yunnan Province (Grant no. 2018FY001-020) and Yunnan Provincial Department of Education Fund (Grant no. 2016CYH05).",,1438166,,March 2020,English,Diffusion,,31,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Optics and Lasers in Engineering,Optical measurement of concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients of binary solution using an asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens,Concentration dependent diffusion coefficients - Concentration-dependent - Cylindrical lens - Finitedifference methods (FDM) - Infinite dilute solutions - Liquid diffusion coefficient - Ray-tracing method - Refractive index profiles,126
Appl Therm Eng,"A novel microwave flash evaporation (MFE) system is presented in this paper for the first time, which is expected to solve the inherent problems of conventional flash evaporation (CFE) system, such as high energy consumption, scaling, and long stages etc. In order to demonstrate the performance of such a novel system, some single factor experiments have been carried out by using water as experimental material, and the influence of parameters such as microwave power, initial temperature, and liquid flow rate have been studied. The results show that the evaporation quantity increases with the increase of microwave power, flow rate, and initial temperature. Under experimental conditions, the better operation condition is achieved at flow-rate of 40 L/h, initial liquid temperature of 50 °C, and microwave power of 1.35 kW, the evaporation quantity in the case of MFE is as high as 1.35 L in 20 min, but it is only 0.74 L in 20 min for CFE. The enhanced performance of MFE system is shown by comparing with the CFE system under the same conditions. Moreover, the energy efficiency is calculated and represented by a dimensionless parameter Gain Output Ratio (GOR), and the maximum energy efficiency for MSF system is about 79.38% at the better operation condition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20194907777093,114471.0,"Shihong, Tian (1, 2, 3, 4); Ravindra, A.V.

Dyes Pigm.,"Naphthalene diimides (NDIs), a class of organic dyes with high photochemical activity and strong luminescent characteristics, have attracted considerable interest because of their photoinduced electron transfer to form stable radical anions in the presence of electron donors upon irradiation. In this paper, two novel metal–organic frameworks constructed from NDIs chromophoric and aromatic dicarboxylic acids, [Zn2(DPMNI)(NCA)2·0.5DMF] (1), [Zn(DPMNI)(PTA)·DMF] (2), (H2NCA = 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, H2PTA = p-phthalic acid, DPMNI = N,N′-bis(4-pyridylmethyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide, DMF = N,N′-dimethylformamide), have been synthesized and characterized systematically. Because of the presence of electron-deficient NDI moieties, they exhibit reversible naked photochromic properties upon irradiation and photocontrolled luminescence due to the generation of NDI radicals. The carboxylate groups as electron donors play a key role in the photoinduced electron-transfer process, and the lone pair–π interaction is a preferred pathway to support photoinduced electron transfer from our work. This study has not only convincingly corroborated the relationship between the photoresponsive rate and non-covalent interactions, but also provided a feasible idea to design novel luminescence switching materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193607410349,107856.0,"Liu, Jian-Jun (1); Wang, Ze-Jie (1); Xia, Shu-Biao (1); Liu, Jiaming (2); Shen, Xiang (1) ","(1) Center for Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau Chemical Functional Materials and Pollution Control, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; 655011, China (2) School of Metallurgy Engineering, Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, Ganzhou; 341000, China ",DYPIDX,741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Carboxylation - Crystalline materials - Dimethylformamide - Electron transitions - Electron transport properties - Free radical reactions - Irradiation - Naphthalene - Organic solvents - Organometallics - Photochromism,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Jian-Jun(jjliu302@163.com) ",10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107856,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18733743,"Number: 21961030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51703118, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51764048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work has been supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (21961030, 51764048, and 51703118), Yunnan Province Thousand Youth Talents Plan, Program of Innovative Research Team (in science and technology) in University of Yunnan Province, Application Basis Research Project of Yunnan Province Science and Technology Department (award No. 2017FD144), and National Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (201710684013).",,1437208,,January 2020,English,Luminescence,,71,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Dyes and Pigments,Photochromic and photocontrolled luminescence properties of two metal-organic frameworks constructed from a naphthalene diimide derivative,Aromatic dicarboxylic acids - Electron transfer - Luminescent characteristics - MOFs - Naphthalene diimide - Non-covalent interaction - Photo-induced electron transfer - Photoinduced electron-transfer process,172
Catal Today,"MoS2-based catalysts showed great promise for converting CO/H2/H2S gas mixture into methanethiol (CH3SH). However, the active phases for this reaction were unexplored widely. In the present study, we tackle this issue through investigating the effect of potassium (K) and supports on the nature of MoS2 catalysts via the characterizations of XRD, UV–vis, TPS, XPS, HR-TEM, as well as HAADF-STEM combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) etc. The results suggested that K species can not only lead to formation of different oxidized precursors but also affect the microstructure, surface morphology and electronic properties of active MoS2 phases. Three sulfided species, i.e., pure MoS2, K-decorated MoS2 and K-intercalated MoS2 nanoslabs, were simultaneously detected, and were demonstrated to be derived from the reduction and sulfidation of oxidized precursors via O[sbnd]S exchange mechanism. Furthermore, the activity results showed that pure MoS2 species worked only for the reaction of CO with H2S to COS, while K-decorated MoS2 and K-intercalated MoS2 nanoslabs exhibited unique ability for the hydrogenation of COS to produce CH3SH. K-decorated MoS2 nanoslabs formed mainly on mesoporous SBA-15 support, which possessed higher CH3SH selectivity than that over K-intercalated MoS2 generated primarily on SiO2 support. In addition, the further improvement of CH3SH selectivity depended on the properties of support with respect to the dispersion, the high dispersion facilitated the formation of the increased amount of Mo-coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS). © 2019",20190206367422,,"Lu, Jichang (1, 2); Luo, Yongming (1); He, Dedong (2, 3); Xu, Zhizhi (1); He, Sufang (1); Xie, Delong (2, 3); Mei, Yi (2, 3) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (3) The Higher Educational Key Laboratory for Phosphorus Chemical Engineering of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",CATTEA,512.1.2 Petroleum Deposits : Development Operations - 549.1 Alkali Metals - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Catalysts - Dispersions - Electronic properties - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Layered semiconductors - Petroleum prospecting - Potassium - Silica,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Mei, Yi(meiyi412@126.com) ",10.1016/j.cattod.2019.01.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: U1402233, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21267011 , U1402233 and 21367015 ).",,9205861,,1 January 2020,English,Molybdenum compounds,,70,93-104,,2020,Elsevier B.V.,Catalysis Today,An exploration into potassium (K) containing MoS2 active phases and its transformation process over MoS2 based materials for producing methanethiol,Co-ordinatively unsaturated - Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS) - Exchange mechanism - Mesoporous SBA-15 - Methanethiol - Pure MoS2 - SBA-15 - Transformation process,339
Carbohydr Polym,"A polysaccharide (PFPP) from purple passion fruit peel was optimally extracted, with the highest yield (10.05%, w/w) obtained under 35 °C extraction temperature, 240 W ultrasonic power, 65:1 mL/g liquid-to-solid ratio, 0.6% (w/v) ammonium oxalate, 30 min extraction time and pH 2.0. According to composition analyses, pectic PFPP and its fractions (PFPP-10, -15 and -20) were revealed as linear homogalacturonans interrupted by rhamnogalacturonan I in different lengths and extensities, where low esterification degrees (35.35–39.66%) were indicated via FT-IR. Furthermore, based on macromolecular models, comprehensive analyses on macromolecular and conformational characterizations of PFPP fractions were conducted quantitatively through, e.g., shape factor (1.42–1.79), Mark-Houwink-Sakurada exponent (0.55–0.74), conformational power-law exponent (0.52–0.58), fractal dimension (1.72–1.94) and persistence length (6.73–13.47 nm). Therefore, different semi-flexible coil conformations were proposed schematically, where lower molecular-weight PFPP fractions were less flexible. This could provide a molecular basis for precise re-utilizations of PFPP in food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20194107528260,115406.0,"Guo, Rui (1); Tian, Sen (1); Li, Xujiao (1); Wu, Xuejiao (1); Liu, Xin (1); Li, Deshun (2); Liu, Yanfang (2); Ai, Lianzhong (3); Song, Zibo (4); Wu, Yan (1) ","(1) Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Safety, School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai; 200240, China (2) Institute of Edible Fungi, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Key Laboratory of Edible Fungi Resources and Utilization (South), Ministry of Agriculture, National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi, National R&D Center for Edible Fungi Processing, Shanghai; 201403, China (3) School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai; 200093, China (4) Yunnan Maoduoli Group Food Co., Ltd., Yuxi; 653100, China ",CAPOD8,802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Extraction - Fractal dimension - Fruits - Oxalic acid - Polysaccharides,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Yan(wuy@sjtu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.115406,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2017YFD0400205, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Number: 19DZ2284200, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This study was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFD0400205 ) and the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology, China (Grant No. 19DZ2284200 ).

Fuel,"This study investigated the steam reforming of a series of organic molecules with varied molecular structures (methanol, formic acid, ethanol, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, acetone, furfural, guaiacol), aiming to understand the impacts of functionalities of these organics on their reaction behaviors. The results showed that molecular structures drastically influenced reactivity and tendencies towards coking during steam reforming. Methanol and formic acid could effectively be reformed and coking was insignificant, as no cracking of C[sbnd]C bonds involved in their conversion. Ethanol, acetic acid, acetaldehyde or acetone was more difficult to be reformed, and coking was significant, especially for acetone or acetaldehyde bearing the carbonyl functionality that could be retained in the precursors of coke. The substantial amount of coke formed in steam reforming of furfural and guaiacol originating from their π-conjugated ring structures and the coke was more graphite-like. In comparison, the coke from reforming of ethanol, acetic acid, acetaldehyde or acetone were more disordered. The in situ DRIFTS studies of steam reforming indicated that the C[dbnd]C and [dbnd]C[sbnd]H functionalities were generated even at 100 °C, which could contribute to coking, when they could not be effectively gasified via steam reforming. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193907480142,116214.0,"Zhang, Lijun (1); Yu, Zhenjie (1); Li, Jiaojiao (1); Zhang, Shu (2); Hu, Song (3); Xiang, Jun (3); Wang, Yi (3); Liu, Qing (4); Hu, Guangzhi (5); Hu, Xun (1) ","(1) School of Material Science and Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan; 250022, China (2) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing; Jiangsu; 210037, China (3) School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan; 430074, China (4) Key Laboratory of Low Carbon Energy and Chemical Engineering, College of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao; Shandong; 266590, China (5) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Nature Resource, Ministry of Education, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",FUELAC,"513.3 Petroleum Products - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,,Acetaldehyde - Acetic acid - Acetone - Catalysts - Ethanol - Formic acid - Furfural - Methanol - Molecular structure - Molecules - Petroleum coke - pH - Steam,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hu, Guangzhi(guangzhihu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.fuel.2019.116214,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2018GSF116014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong; Number: 2016YFE0204000, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: ZR2017BB002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Taishan Scholar Foundation of Shandong Province; Number: 51876080, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51876080 ), the Strategic International Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation Special Funds of National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFE0204000 ), the Program for Taishan Scholars of Shandong Province Government, the Recruitment Program of Global Experts (Thousand Youth Talents Plan), the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province ( ZR2017BB002 ) and the Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province ( 2018GSF116014 ).",,162361,,1 January 2020,English,Steam reforming,,54,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Fuel,Steam reforming of typical small organics derived from bio-oil: Correlation of their reaction behaviors with molecular structures,Carbonyl functionality - Coke formation - Nickel catalyst - Organic molecules - Reaction behavior - Ring structures - Situ DRIFT - Small organic molecules,259
Neurocomputing,"We present a method based on a robust two-layer cascade reciprocal pipeline (TCPR) and the context-aware dissimilarity measure (CADM) for feature-based image registration. We first build the two-layer pipeline to find the optimal correspondence and to achieve the image transformation. In the first layer, the neighborhood structures of point sets are used to find and register reliable feature point sets. In the second layer, we create the point-to-point neighborhood structure to recover the remaining inliers for image registration. The CADM with scaling, translation and rotation invariance is then designed for dissimilarity evaluation.

Microbiol Res.,"The role of the gut microbiome in animal health has become increasingly evident. Although the structure of the gut microbiome of A. mellifera is well known, little is known about the dynamic change across different developmental stages. In this study, we explored the dynamic changes of the gut microbiota of A. mellifera at different developmental stages covering the whole life cycle using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that the core (shared) gut microbiota changes significantly among different developmental stages. The diversity of the bacterial community in workers among different ages was significantly different. In addition, by comparing the core gut microbiota among different-aged workers, we found that newly emerged workers had fewer core microbiota. Three genera, Gilliamella, Frischella, and Snodgrassella, were significantly colonized at 1 day poste mergence (dpe); Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Commensalibacter were significantly colonized at 3 dpe and significantly reduced with Gilliamella. Lactobacillus kunkeei and Bartonella were significantly colonized at 12 dpe and were significantly decreased with Lactobacillus helsingborgensis. Commensalibacter and Bifidobacterium were significantly decreased at 25 dpe, and Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, and Porphyromonadaceae were significantly decreased between 19 and 25 dpe. Our results reveal the succession of the gut microbiota of workers from birth to senescence, which provides a theoretical basis for further exploring the roles of gut microbiota during different developmental stages. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH",20194607691952,126370.0,"Dong, Zhi-Xiang (1, 3); Li, Huan-Yuan (1, 3); Chen, Yi-Fei (1, 3); Wang, Feng (1, 3); Deng, Xian-Yu (1, 3); Lin, Lian-Bing (1, 3); Zhang, Qi-Lin (1, 3); Li, Ji-Lian (2); Guo, Jun (1, 3) ","(1) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Ministry Key Laboratory of Pollinating Insect Biology, Institute of Apicultural Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing; 100093, China (3) Engineering Research Center for Application Technology of Green Agricultural Microbes of Yunnan College, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",MCRSEJ,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering,,,,,RNA - Veterinary medicine,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Qi-Lin(zhangql@kust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.micres.2019.126370,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 31660695, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31660695) Appendix A,,9445013,,January 2020,English,Life cycle,,45,,,2020,Elsevier GmbH,Microbiological Research,Colonization of the gut microbiota of honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers at different developmental stages,Apis mellifera - Bifidobacterium - Colonization - Lactobacillus kunkeei - Microbiotas,231
Opt Laser Technol,"A new classification method is proposed in this paper which categorizes the phase-to-depth calibration methods for fringe projection profilometry into pixel-dependent (P-D) ones and pixel-independent (P-I) ones. In P-D methods, depth is expressed as a function of the unwrapped phase, and parameters of the function are different from pixel to pixel. In P-I calibration methods, depth is expressed as a function of both phase and pixel coordinate, and there is only one set of parameters which applies to all pixels. P-D method is resistant to distortion of the projector or the camera but is time-consuming because a number of phase maps need to be recorded; P-I method requires only two or three phase maps but is sensitive to distortion. To address this problem, we further propose a blockwise calibration method. It requires the same number of phase maps as the P-I method and meanwhile can be as resistant to distortion as the P-D method. Simulation results show that when phase maps are contaminated by random additive noise, error produced by the proposed blockwise method is even less than that of the P-D method which uses 18 phase maps. In the experiment the proposed method and the P-D method were utilized to calibrate a fiber-optic fringe projection profilometer and then heights of a 4 mm and a 7 mm gauge block were measured. Difference between results of the two methods was less than the accuracy of the translation stage (0.01 mm), which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20193907464978,105844.0,"Huang, Tingting (1); Fu, Xiao (1); Li, Xiuming (1, 2); Zhang, Cong (1); Duan, Fajie (1); Jiang, Jiajia (1); Tan, Haishu (3) ","(1) State Key Lab of Precision Measuring Technology & Instruments, Tianjin University, Tianjin; 300072, China (2) College of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, Yunnan Open University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (3) Foshan University, Foshan; Guangdong; 528000, China ",OLTCAS,703 Electric Circuits - 741.1.2 Fiber Optics,,,,,Additive noise - Calibration - Fiber optics - Profilometry - Surface fitting,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Duan, Fajie(fjduan@tju.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.optlastec.2019.105844,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2016QNRC001, Acronym: CAST, Sponsor: China Association for Science and Technology; Number: 2017YFF0204800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 17JCQNJC01100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City; Number: 51775377, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Key Research and Development Plan ( 2017YFF0204800 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61501319 , 51775377 and 61505140 ), Tianjin Natural Science Foundation of China ( 17JCQNJC01100 ), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology ( 2016QNRC001 ).",,303992,,February 2020,English,Pixels,,20,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,Optics and Laser Technology,Phase-to-depth calibration in fringe projection profilometry based on blockwise surface fitting,Calibration method - Classification methods - Fringe projection - Fringe projection profilometry - Phase-to-depth calibration - Profilometers - Translation stage - Unwrapped phase,122
Bioelectrochemistry,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been reported to promote symbiotic metabolism in bacteria by accelerating interspecies electron transfer. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated or proven in a cocultures system.

Results showed that addition of MWCNTs accelerated the metabolic rate of the cocultures. Succinate production rate in a test with 1.0 g L−1 MWCNTs was 1.12 mM d−1, 1.67 times higher than without MWCNTs. However, the biotoxicity effect became evident with the addition of much higher levels of MWCNTs addition. This study supports the possibility that carbon nanotubes accelerate interspecies electron transfer and provides a theoretical basis for the MWCNTs application in the process of anaerobic wastewater treatment. © 2019",20194507631947,107346.0,"Zheng, Shiling (1); Li, Zeng (2); Zhang, Peng (3, 4); Wang, Bingchen (1); Zhang, Pengyu (3); Feng, Yujie (2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Biological Resources Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No 17 Chunhui Road, Laishan District, Yantai; Shandong; 264003, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, No.73 Huanghe Road, Nangang District, Harbin; 150090, China (3) Faculty of Environmental Science & Engineering, Kunming University of Science & Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (4) Yunnan Key Lab of Soil Carbon Sequestration and Pollution Control, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",BIOEFK,452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 761 Nanotechnology,,,,,Electron transitions - Metabolism - Nanotubes - Wastewater treatment,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Feng, Yujie(yujief@hit.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.bioelechem.2019.107346,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1878562X,"Number: 2017YFA0207201, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: SKLUWRE, Sponsor: State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment; Number: -, Acronym: HIT, Sponsor: Harbin Institute of Technology; Number: 41807325, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFA0207201 ).

Chemosphere,"Triclosan (TCS) has potentially toxic effects on humans and animals. However, the possible roles and mechanisms of TCS in endothelial cells (ECs) are still unknown. Abnormal damage to ECs and vascular function is a critical process in various cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD), atherosclerosis, stroke, and hypertension. Hence, we explored the potential toxicological roles of TCS in EC functions. Cell Counting Kit-8, apoptosis, transwell, wound healing, and tube-formation experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of TCS on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) function. Additionally, the levels of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR phosphorylation were measured by Western blot. The results indicated that TCS treatment suppressed HUVECs viability, migration and angiogenesis. TCS treatment increased the expression of inflammatory markers and ROS in cultured HUVECs. Moreover, TCS treatment inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR expression. All of these results reveal that TCS induces notable vascular injury and affects the viability, migration and angiogenic capacity of HUVECs, at least in part via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. © 2019",20194107526279,125077.0,"Zhang, Min (1); Zhu, Rongrong (2); Zhang, Libin (3) ","(1) Division of Cardiology, TongRen Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai; 200336, China (2) Division of Spine, Department of Orthopedics, Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China (3) Department of Thoracic Surgery, First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650031, China ",CMSHAF,461.9 Biology,,,,,Cell death - Endothelial cells,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Min(zm19821982@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125077,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18791298,"Number: 2017ZF026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",This project was supported by a grant from Huimin special science and technology (no. 2017ZF026 ).
