Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am.,"We have obtained tomographic maps of Lg coda Q and its frequency dependence at 1 Hz for all of North America assuming that all of our coda Q data can be described by a power law. Our map of Q0displays highest values (700-1000) throughout a large region that coincides with the Canadian Shield and exhibits sharp changes inQ0across much of the boundary separating the high values of the shield from lower values outside it. A second high Q region appears as a small oval of high Q0values (650-700) overlying much of the Ozark uplift in the central United States. A band of low values (200-350) covers most of Central America and Mexico and extends northward from California into western Canada before broadening in Alaska. A north-south-trending band of high η values, extending from northern Canada to the gulf coast, separates the North American Cordillera from stable portions of central North America. We compared our Q0and η determinations with those found in five earlier studies in two regions of the United States. In the present study, in each region these values agree with values found in the earlier studies when earthquake-station distances are greater than 300 km but differ when distances are less than that. The similarity of our Q0measurements to previous direct Lg and Lg coda measurements and the inverse correlation we find of Q0with upper mantle temperatures suggest that we may predominantly be measuring intrinsic Q0. We propose a mechanism for explaining why scattering dominates over intrinsic attenuation for Lg and Lg coda propagation at short distances but can be secondary to intrinsic attenuation at long distances. It can be nicely described using a ray characterization for Lg and understanding that at short distances many near-vertical traveling rays are multiply reflected in the crust and much energy is lost to the mantle. At greater distances (say 300 km), virtually all of the reflected waves exceed the critical angle and so cannot easily be lost to the mantle. © 2015, Seismological Society of America.

Int. J. u e Serv. Sci. Technol.,"Fair resource is a key building block of any shared computing system. Recently fair division theory has emerged as a promising approach for the allocation of multiple computational resources among agents. Recent research has discussed efficiency and fairness requirements and identified a number if desirable scheduling objectives including so-called dominant resource fairness(DRF). DRF is not good between fair and resource utilization. A new allocation model Balancing Fairness and Efficiency with Bottleneck-Aware Allocation(BAA) find good appropriate balance between fairness to the clients and maximizing system utilization. But BAA without taking into account the weight value and maximum number of tasks which are users need to run. We propose the IBAA fair allocation mechanism. IBAA has lots of good properties, it satisfies DSI, PE and EF. We construct IBAA mechanisms that provably satisfy properties, and analyze the performance. We believe that our work informs the design of superior multiusers system, and at the same time expands the scope of fair division theory by initiating the study of dynamic and fair resource allocation mechanisms. © 2015 SERSC.",,,20162502505784,,"Liu, Jun (1); Liu, Xi (2) ","(1) College of Mathematics and Information Science, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; Yunnan, China (2) Colleg of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 912.2 Management - 913.1 Production Engineering",,,,,Cloud computing - Efficiency - Resource allocation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.14257/ijunesst.2015.8.11.39,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,20054246,11,2015,English,Computation theory,,12.0,415-424,,2015,Science and Engineering Research Support Society,"International Journal of u- and e- Service, Science and Technology",,Improve constrained recourse fairness in cloud computing with bottleneck-aware allocation,,Allocation model - Computational resources - Dominant resource fairness - Efficiency and fairness - Fair resource allocation - Recent researches - Resource utilizations - System utilization,8,
IEEE/ACM Trans. Comput. BioL. Bioinf.,"Protein complexes play a significant role in understanding the underlying mechanism of most cellular functions. Recently, many researchers have explored computational methods to identify protein complexes from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. One group of researchers focus on detecting local dense subgraphs which correspond to protein complexes by considering local neighbors. The drawback of this kind of approach is that the global information of the networks is ignored. Some methods such as Markov Clustering algorithm (MCL), PageRank-Nibble are proposed to find protein complexes based on random walk technique which can exploit the global structure of networks. However, these methods ignore the inherent core-attachment structure of protein complexes and treat adjacent node equally. In this paper, we design a weighted PageRank-Nibble algorithm which assigns each adjacent node with different probability, and propose a novel method named WPNCA to detect protein complex from PPI networks by using weighted PageRank-Nibble algorithm and core-attachment structure. Firstly, WPNCA partitions the PPI networks into multiple dense clusters by using weighted PageRank-Nibble algorithm. Then the cores of these clusters are detected and the rest of proteins in the clusters will be selected as attachments to form the final predicted protein complexes. The experiments on yeast data show that WPNCA outperforms the existing methods in terms of both accuracy and p-value.The software for WPNCA is available at 'http://netlab.csu.edu.cn/bioinfomatics/weipeng/WPNCA/download.html' © 2004-2012 IEEE.",,,20150800563468,6867299,"Peng, Wei (1, 2); Wang, Jianxin (1); Zhao, Bihai (1); Wang, Lusheng (3) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (2) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong ",,722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Complex networks - Proteins - Random processes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TCBB.2014.2343954,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,15455963,1,"January 1, 2015",English,Clustering algorithms,,36.0,179-192,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,,Identification of protein complexes using weighted PageRank-nibble algorithm and core-attachment structure,,Core-attachment structures - Global informations - Identification of proteins - PageRank - Protein complexes - Protein interaction networks - Protein-protein interaction networks - Random Walk,12,
ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,"Currently, many types of affinity materials have been developed for the enrichment of glycoproteins potentially considered to be clinical biomarkers; however, they can not effectively distinguish between different glycoproteins and thus lack the functionality that may be the key to the diagnosis of specific diseases. In the present work, a novel interface-free 2D monolithic material has been developed for the separation of multiple types of glycoproteins, in which boronate-functionalized graphene acts as preconcentration segment and poly(guanidinium ionic liquid) acts as separation segment. The resultant 2D material was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and electroosmotic flow analysis to demonstrate successful modification at each step. The performance of this 2D material was evaluated by capillary electrochromatography and allowed the successful online concentration and separation of five standard glycoproteins. The high separation efficiency can be largely attributed to the good orthogonality of boronate-functionalized graphene monolith and poly(guanidinium ionic liquid) monolith. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20153801289138,,"Liu, Cuicui (1); Deng, Qiliang (1); Fang, Guozhen (1); Huang, Xuan (1); Wang, Shuo (1); He, Jinsong (2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin; 300457, China (2) Institute of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Yunnan; 650201, China ",,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 461.9 Biology - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Diagnosis - Electroosmosis - Glycoproteins - Graphene - Ionic liquids - Two dimensional - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fang, Guozhen(fangguozhen@tust.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acsami.5b07668,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19448252,,,,19448244,36,"September 16, 2015",English,Interfaces (materials),,46.0,20430-20437,,2015,American Chemical Society,ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,,A novel poly(ionic liquid) interface-free two-dimensional monolithic material for the separation of multiple types of glycoproteins,,Capillary electrochromatography - Clinical biomarkers - Functionalized graphene - Guanidinium - High separation efficiency - Monolithic material - Online concentrations - Pre-concentration and separations,7,
Neurocomputing,"In this paper we propose a subspace learning algorithm based on supervised manifold learning techniques to address the problem of inferring 3D human poses from monocular video frames. Low-dimensional representations of visual features are computed via spectral embedding, regularized by the pairwise relationship of poses for simultaneously preserving the locality in the feature space and taking account of similarities in the pose space. To deal with the 'out-of-sample' problem, we obtain a global linear projection from the embedding whereby the Euclidean distances between transformed feature vectors can faithfully reflect the corresponding pose distances. To retrieve the most similar candidate from the exemplar database, weighted sum of Euclidean distances of features is employed to achieve better accuracy instead of simply summing up the squared distances of all feature types. The experimental results on HumanEva dataset validate the efficacy of our proposed method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",,,20151900835805,,"Yu, Jun (1); Guo, Yukun (2); Tao, Dapeng (3); Wan, Jian (1) ","(1) Hangzhou Dianzi University, China (2) Xiamen University, China (3) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, China ",NRCGEO,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing,,,,,Three dimensional computer graphics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tao, Dapeng(dapeng.tao@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.neucom.2015.04.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18728286,,,,09252312,,"October 20, 2015",English,Learning algorithms,,45.0,301-308,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Neurocomputing,,Human pose recovery by supervised spectral embedding,,Euclidean distance - Human pose estimations - Linear projections - Low-dimensional representation - Monocular video - Spectral embedding - Squared distances - Supervised manifold learning,166,
Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,"Copy-move forgery is one of the most simple and commonly used forging methods, where a part of image itself is copied and pasted on another part of the same image. This paper presents a new approach for copy-move forgery detection where fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is used. First, the 1-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of the forged image is to reduce its dimension. Next, the low frequency the sub-band is divided into overlapped blocks of equal size. The fractional Fourier transform of each block is calculated and the vector of the coefficients is constructed. All feature vectors are sorted using lexicographical order. Finally, the difference of adjacent feature vectors is evaluated and employed to locate the duplicated regions which have the same feature vectors.

Appl Therm Eng,"A novel solar water-bath solid adsorption ice-making system with activated carbon-methanol as adsorption working pairs was designed and constructed. The experimental results demonstrated that the desorption temperature and the desorption time had important influences on performance of the ice-making system. The daily ice-making capacity of 5.1 kg and refrigeration cycle coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.0322 could be obtained when the desorption temperature was maintained at 94 °C. However, there were no ice-making phenomenon when the desorption temperature was respectively maintained at 85 °C and 75 °C. With the increasing of desorption time from 7 h to 12 h when the desorption temperature was maintained at 94 °C, the COP of the system dropped gradually from 0.0507 to 0.0370, and the heat utilization efficiency decreased from 0.5969 to 0.4608 due to the gradual increase of energy imported into the system. The daily ice-making capacity increased rapidly from 5.5 kg to 7.6 kg when the desorption time increased from 7 h to 10 h, however, the daily ice-making capacity increased slightly from 7.6 kg to 7.7 kg when the desorption time was increased from 10 h to 12 h.

RSC Adv.,"An activated carbon-based multicarboxyl adsorbent has been synthesized for selective removal of cationic dyes from aqueous solutions. The adsorbent was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2adsorption measurement and zeta potential. The adsorption behavior of cationic rhodamine 6G on the activated carbon-based multicarboxyl adsorbent from an aqueous medium was studied by varying the parameters such as pH, contact time and initial dye concentration. Dye adsorption was dramatically dependent on solution pH and the optimum pH is 4.45. After being modified by multicarboxyls, the adsorption capacity of rhodamine 6G on the activated carbon dramatically increased from 33.18 mg L-1to 122.55 mg L-1at pH 4.45. The multicarboxyl adsorbent has obvious selectivity to cationic dyes. Adsorption isotherms could be well described by the Langmuir model, adsorption kinetics fitted well with a pseudo-second-order kinetic equation and exhibited a 3-stage intraparticle diffusion mode.

Energy Convers. Manage.,"Abstract This paper mainly focuses on the modeling and simulation of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine generation system. In this paper, a new method which combines the mechanical part and electrical part is presented to model the wind turbine generation system. The turbine rotor blade is modeled by the lifting line model and the aerodynamic forces are solved by the improved free vortex wakes method with the supplementary of two dimensional aerodynamic data (three dimensional corrected). The control system of pitching and generator with voltage oriented control (VOC) are established in Matlab/Simulink. The drive train is also modeled with two mass model. In order to realize the coupling computation of the wind turbine model, a data link is built to transfer the parameters between aerodynamic part and electrical part. In this way, the interaction between turbine rotor and generator could be predicted. The validations are firstly made to ensure the reliability of the model.

J. Agric. Food Chem.,"Sinonovacula constricta has been widely used as a health food and medicine in China, Japan, and Korea. In the present study, a water-soluble polysaccharide fraction (SCP-1) was prepared from S. constricta by enzyme-assisted extraction and purification of chromatography with DEAE-52 cellulose anion-exchange column and Sephadex G-100 size exclusion column. On the basis of the analytical results of high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and NMR spectroscopy, SCP-1 was found to have an average molecular weight of 15.63 kDa and a linear backbone of (1→4)-linked α-d-Glcp residue with one branch, α-d-Glcp, attached to the main chain by a (1→6) glycosidic bond at every five α-d-Glcp units. Furthermore, it was found that SCP-1 could significantly increase the viability of macrophages, enhance the capability of macrophage phagocytosis, increase the activity of acid phosphatase, and promote the production of nitric oxide, mouse tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, mouse interferon (IFN)-γ, and mouse interleukin (IL)-1β. The results suggest that SCP-1 possesses potent immunomodulating effect and may be explored as a potential biological response modifier. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20153801295712,,"Yuan, Qingxia (1); Zhao, Longyan (2); Cha, Qianqian (1); Sun, Yi (1); Ye, Hong (1); Zeng, Xiaoxiong (1) ","(1) College of Food Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing; 210095, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; Yunnan; 650201, China ",JAFCAU,461.9 Biology - 461.9.1 Immunology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Alkylation - Antigen-antibody reactions - Column chromatography - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Glycoproteins - High performance liquid chromatography - Ion exchange - Macrophages - Mammals - Mathematical transformations - Nitric oxide - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Phosphatases - Polysaccharides - Structure (composition),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zeng, Xiaoxiong(zengxx@njau.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03306,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205118,,,,00218561,36,"August 28, 2015",English,Size exclusion chromatography,,73.0,7986-7994,,2015,American Chemical Society,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,,Structural Characterization and Immunostimulatory Activity of a Homogeneous Polysaccharide from Sinonovacula constricta,,Biological response modifiers - Enzyme-assisted extractions - Homogeneous polysaccharides - Immunomodulatory activities - Immunostimulatory activities - Sinonovacula constricta - Structural characterization - Water-soluble polysaccharides,63,
Anal. Methods,"Blood serum and plasma are the most frequently used biofluids in metabolomics. The primary aim of this study was to ascertain the feasibility of the commonly used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based methoximation followed by silylation with the BSTFA + 1% TMCS (MeOx-TMS) derivatization method, and to reveal the metabolic differences between serum and plasma. Individual variations were evaluated by different groups of serum and plasma samples collected from healthy volunteers in 2011 and 2013. The experimental results indicated that differences of metabolic levels among individuals were much higher than the variations of the experimental repeatability and precision. In addition, a discriminant model between serum and plasma was established using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Six characteristic metabolites, phosphate, serine, 2,3,4-trihydroxybutyrate, citric acid, glucose and arachidonic acid, were screened out and considered to have the most important contribution to the discrimination. Results of this work will provide some valuable suggestions to researchers on the selection of suitable biofluids in metabolomic research.

"CICTP - Effic., Safe, Green Multimodal Transp. - Proc. COTA Int. Conf. Transp. Prof.","Pedestrian crowd dynamics is influenced by various factors, such as walkway width, travel purpose, number of pedestrians, direction composition, etc. However, most research on pedestrian simulation models regard pedestrians as homogeneous individuals with the same attributes and having the same behavior strategy. This hypothesis develops a simulation model that is easy to understand and compute, but it neglects the influence of individual differences on crowd dynamics. Based on the social-forces model, we developed a heterogeneity pedestrian activity model in an agent framework. Different simulation test scenarios were designed for the comparison study of homogeneous and heterogeneous crowd dynamics, and how pedestrian attribute differentiation influences crowd dynamics is discussed. The simulation test results indicate that the heterogeneous mechanism has significant effects on crowd dynamics. For bi-directional pedestrian flow in a walkway, the speed of flow is decreases with the introduction of heterogeneous pedestrians. For uni-directional pedestrians blocked in a bottleneck, compared with homogeneous groups, heterogeneous pedestrian flows are faster to break through the bottleneck congestion situation; even when the average speed of the heterogeneous groups is lower, the total time consumed in the bottleneck is shorter than the homogeneous group. © ASCE.",,,20160201777674,,"He, Min (1); Yu, Haining (1); Luan, Qingxiong (1); Fan, Dong (1) ","(1) Faculty of Transportation Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,432 Highway Transportation - 433 Railroad Transportation - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals,117391.0,"July 24, 2015 - July 27, 2015","Beijing, China","15th COTA International Conference of Transportation Professionals: Efficient, Safe, and Green Multimodal Transportation, CICTP 2015",Agents - Multimodal transportation - Traffic congestion,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1061/9780784479292.296,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9780784479292.0,,,2015,English,Dynamics,"CICTP 2015 - Efficient, Safe, and Green Multimodal Transportation - Proceedings of the 15th COTA International Conference of Transportation Professionals",14.0,3196-3207,1of1,2015,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),"CICTP 2015 - Efficient, Safe, and Green Multimodal Transportation - Proceedings of the 15th COTA International Conference of Transportation Professionals",Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE); Transportation and Development Institute (T and DI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE); Transportation Research Board,Study on Heterogeneous Pedestrian Dynamics with Improved Social Force Model,,Bottleneck congestion - Crowd dynamics - Individual Differences - Pedestrian crowd dynamics - Pedestrian dynamics - Pedestrian simulation - Pedestrians heterogeneous - Social force models,,

Among the obtained catalysts, the porous Co3O4-CeO2with 20 wt% Co exhibits the best catalytic activity and the 50 % CO conversion can be reached at 74 C. The presence of transition metal element Co can promote the production of oxygen vacancies and improve oxygen mobility, which result in enhancing the oxygen-storage capacity of porous Co3O4-CeO2and its catalytic performance for CO conversion.

Waste Manage.,"In considering the impact of inoculation time and the characteristics of composting material and inoculants on the usefulness of inoculation, a new composting strategy has been proposed and studied, in which three inocula were inoculated at three stages of composting process respectively: inoculum A (Thermoactinomyces sp. GF1 and GF2) was inoculated before fermentation to increase or maintain high temperature of pile, inoculum B (Coprinus cinerea and Coprinus comatus) was inoculated after thermophilic phase to promote degradation of lignin, and inoculum C (Trichoderma harzianum and Rhizopus oryzae) was inoculated after 30-day fermentation to promote degradation of cellulose. The results showed that the inoculations could significantly enhance the temperature of pile and the degradation of lignocelluloses. When inocula A, B, and C were inoculated into pile, temperature increased from 25. °C to 65. °C, from 33. °C to 39. °C and from 33. °C to 38. °C respectively and 35% lignin and 43% cellulose had been degraded in inoculated pile compared to the degradation of 15% lignin and 25% cellulose in control pile. As a result, the C/N ratio dropped more rapidly degraded in the inoculated pile (reached 20 after 33-day fermentation) than that in the control pile (reached 21.7 after 45-day fermentation).

Earthqua. Eng. Struct. Dyn.,"The time delay resulting from the servo hydraulic systems can potentially destabilize the real-time dynamic hybrid testing (RTDHT) systems. In this paper, the discrete-time root locus technique is adopted to investigate the delay-dependent stability performance of MDOF RTDHT systems. Stability analysis of an idealized two-story shear frame with two DOFs is first performed to illustrate the proposed method. The delay-dependent stability condition is presented for various structural properties, time delay, and integration time steps. Effects of delay compensation methods on stability are also investigated. Then, the proposed method is applied to analyze the delay-dependent stability of a single shaking table RTDHT system with an 18-DOF finite element numerical substructure, and corresponding RTDHTs are carried out to verify the theoretical results. Furthermore, the stability behavior of a finite element RTDHT system with two physical substructures, loaded by twin shaking tables, is theoretically and experimentally investigated. All experimental results convincingly demonstrate that the delay-dependent stability analysis on the basis of the discrete-time root locus technique is feasible.

"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf. Trust, Secur. Priv. Comput. Commun., TrustCom",The face recognition method based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is always faced with the high-dimensional small sample size problem in image processing. The two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) which was proposed recently can extract the feature from the original image matrix directly and decrease the dimensionality of the original matrix in a great extent. But there are still some problems such as the overlap of the neighbor samples and the deviation of the class-center. This paper improves the 2DLDA algorithm and proposes the MF2DLDA algorithm. The MF2DLDA algorithm improves the recognition rate by redefining the between-class scatter matrix which can retains the most discriminative features and using the median matrix instead of the mean matrix which can weaken the negative effect that the anomalous data has on the computing of the median matrix. The results of the experiments show that the new algorithm is feasible. © 2014 IEEE.,,,20150800552419,7011316,"Wang, Dong (1); Wang, Shunfang (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,921.1 Algebra - 922 Statistical Methods,110160.0,"September 24, 2014 - September 26, 2014","Beijing, China","13th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications, TrustCom 2014",Discriminant analysis - Image analysis - Matrix algebra,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shunfang ",10.1109/TrustCom.2014.92,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479965137.0,,,"January 15, 2015",English,Face recognition,,14.0,707-713,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2014 IEEE 13th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications, TrustCom 2014","IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC); School of Software, Tsinghua University",Improved 2DLDA algorithm and its application in face recognition,,Between class scatter - Discriminative features - Face recognition methods - Linear discriminant analyses (LDA) - Linear discriminant analysis - Locally weighted - Small sample size problems - Two dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2dlda),,
"Int. Conf. Control, Autom. Inf. Sci., ICCAIS","A novel constrained-state feedback control design method for duty-standby controllers of a dependable control system is presented in this paper. The dependable control system is a replacement for the classical reliable control system which has been developed for wired and analog systems. As an alternative to the control summation in reliable control systems, only one controller is active at any one time in a dependable control system. This will make it compatible with the duty-standby architecture of dependable computer systems that run the control algorithm. The automated managing of duty-standby controllers is challenging, especially in wireless sensor and actuator networks, owing to the scarcity of both information and processing resources. The solutions proposed in this paper are effective and feasible, as taking into account both state- and control-incremental constraints, and simply involving a static state-feedback strategy to minimize the computational demand in implementations. The state feedback gains are synthesized to fulfill the strict requirement on the two incremental constraints. As a result of that, the duty-standby controllers will be able to operate independently, while assuring the closed-loop system stability with a newly introduced self-recovery constraint. For a dependable control system, the employed self-recovery constraint is a quadratic constraint with respect to the control and state increments. © 2014 IEEE.",,,20150900577592,7020574,"Tran, Tri (1); Ha, Q.P.

Mol. Phys.,"The density functional theory (DFT) is exploited to search the stable conformations of a cyclic pentapeptide called cycloaspeptide G from Cordyceps-colonising fungus Isoria farinose. Its time-dependent version is employed to describe the profiles of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) of the preferred conformation, where the solvent effect in methanol is taken into account on the basis of the polarisable continuum model computation. Four stable conformers are optimised, and the results of the harmonically vibrational frequency calculations illustrate that they are the true minima. In the vibrational CD spectrum at the B3LYP/6-31G∗ level, the negative peak at 3334 cm-1has its origin of the NH stretches of the peptide ring. In the ECD spectrum at the B3LYP/6-31G∗ level, three strong bands are negative, positive, and negative. Since the ECD spectrum at the B3LYP/6-31G∗ level is remarkably different from that at the B3LYP/6-31G level, it is necessary for the expended functions to be added to the 6-31G basis set. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,,20143600020777,,"Mang, Chao-Yong (1); Zhao, Yu (2); Li, Hai-Feng (1); Lan, Hai (1); Yan, Ya (1); Yang, Ming-Hui (1) ","(1) Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Dali University, Dali, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Entomological Biopharmaceutical Research and Development, Dali University, Dali, China ",MOPHAM,"461.9 Biology - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity",,,,,Computation theory - Conformations - Continuum mechanics - Dichroism - Organic solvents - Peptides,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Mang, Chao-Yong ",10.1080/00268976.2014.945503,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),13623028,"Number: 2011FZ163, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 811603993, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81360616, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 81260512, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The project was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 81360616], [grant number 81260512], [grant number 811603993]; the Natural Science Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Yunnan province in China [grant number 2011FZ163].",,00268976,1,"January 2, 2015",English,Density functional theory,,22.0,104-112,,2015,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Molecular Physics,,"Structural characteristics and spectral behaviours of the preferred conformation of a cyclic pentapeptide, cycloaspeptide G from Cordyceps -colonising fungus Isoria farinose",,Continuum Modeling - Cyclic peptides - Electronic circular dichroism - Frequency calculations - Stable conformers - Structural characteristics - Time-dependent density functional calculations - Vibrational circular dichroism,113,
Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"In order to improve the speed of texture synthesis, we propose an improved synthesis algorithm according to the Image Quilting algorithm in this paper. In this algorithm, the L-overlap region is replaced by r-overlap region to reduce the amount of the pixels used to compute the error of Sum-of-Squared Differences (SSD) and to lower the calculation redundancy. Parallel calculation is adopted to search the best synthesis patch from texture sample image and make further improvement on the synthesis speed. In addition, the area used for looking for the minimal cost path is enlarged from one patch to more patches that belong to the same row to retain or improve the synthesis effect. The experiment results show the proposed method has faster synthesis speed and lower algorithm complexity than the Image Quilting algorithm. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,,20153801284612,,"Pu, Yuanyuan (1); Xu, Dan (1); Qian, Wenhua (1); Huang, Yaqun (1); Dan, Youyan (2) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Kunming Metallurgy College, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications",,,,,Computational complexity - Computer graphics - Image enhancement - Parallel processing systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pu, Yuanyuan(km_pyy@126.com) ",10.1007/978-3-662-48247-6_10,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),16113349,,,,03029743,,2015,English,Image texture,,18.0,103-113,,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,An improved texture synthesis algorithm,,Algorithm complexity - Image quilting - Image quilting algorithms - Minimal cost - Overlap region - Parallel calculation - Sum of squared differences - Texture synthesis,8971,
J. Sep. Sci.,"Damage of blood-brain barrier is a common result of traumatic brain injury. This damage can open the blood-brain barrier and allow drug passage. An ultraperformance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was established to determine the concentration of rhein in the biofluids (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid) of patients with a compromised blood-brain barrier following traumatic brain injury after rhubarb administration. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profiles were analyzed. A triple-quadruple tandem mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization was used for rhein detection. The mass transition followed was m/z 283.06→239.0. The calibration curve was linear in the concentration range of 10-8000 ng/mL for the biofluids. The intra- and interday precisions were less than 10%. The relative standard deviation of recovery was less than 15% in biological matrices. The pharmacokinetic data showed that rhein was rapidly transported into biofluids, and exhibited a peak concentration 1 h after rhubarb administration. The elimination rate of rhein was slow. The AUCcerebrospinal fluid/AUCplasma(AUC is area under curve) of rhein was approximately 17%, indicating that portions of rhein could pass the impaired blood-brain barrier. The method was successfully applied to quantify rhein in the biofluids of all patients. The data presented can help to guide clinical applications of rhubarb for treating traumatic brain injury. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

RSC Adv.,"In the present work, a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for ultrasensitive determination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was designed by using Au/Pd@SnO2as sensing platform and gold@mesoporous carbon nanocomposites (Au@CMK-3) as signal amplification. In this work, Au@CMK-3 was prepared for immobilizing large amounts of redox probe-methylene blue (MB), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and secondary antibodies (Ab2), leading to the formation of Au@CMK-3-MB-Ab2-HRP bioconjugate. Furthermore, Au/Pd@SnO2was utilized as the biosensor platform to immobilize the primary antibodies (Ab1) leading a further enhancement in the sensitivity of immunosensor. With the synergistic effects among the Au/Pd@SnO2platform, the Au@CMK-3 nanocarrier, the ultrafine Pd NPs electrocatalyst, and HRP enzymatic reactions, an almost doubled amplified detection signal was achieved in the presence of H2O2, so as to improve the detection limit of the proposed immunosensor effectively. The constructed immunosensor exhibited desirable performance for determination of PSA with a wide linearity in the range from 0.01 to 100 ng mL-1and a relatively low detection limit of 3 pg mL-1.

Electron. J. Geotech. Eng.,"A series of dynamic triaxial tests were carried out to investigate the variation laws of the dynamic parameters of typical silt soil in seasonal frozen region obtained from the embankment along the Harbin-Daqing railway subjected to train loading. Effects on the dynamic elastic modulus and damping ratio of the repeat freeze-thaw cycles, moisture content, loading frequency, and confining pressure were studied. The relationship between the modulus ratio and dynamic strain under various factors was proposed. The results show that the repeat freeze-thaw cycles have a significant effect on the backbone curve of silt soil in seasonal frozen region. The dynamic stress tends to decrease with the increase of the number of repeat freeze-thaw cycles for a certain dynamic strain. The maximum dynamic elastic modulus increases with the increasing confining pressure or the decreasing moisture content. The damping ratio increases with the number of repeat freeze-thaw cycles increases and it increases considerably after five freeze-thaw cycles. In addition, the damping ratio is strongly influenced by the loading frequency and it increases dramatically under 4Hz in comparison with that under 2Hz. Under the condition of the same dynamic strain, the damping ratio increases with the moisture content increases. © 2015 ejge.",,,20160601896858,,"An, Lingshi (1); Ling, Xianzhang (1); Wang, Min (2); Li, Qionglin (1); Zhang, Feng (3); Wang, Lina (4) ","(1) School of Civil Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Heilongjiang, Harbin, China (2) Beijing General Municipal Engineering Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd., Beijing, China (3) School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Heilongjiang, Harbin, China (4) School of Construction Engineering, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China ",,483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 502.1 Mine and Quarry Operations - 931.1 Mechanics - 944.2 Moisture Measurements - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Damping - Freezing - Moisture - Moisture determination - Rock pressure - Silt - Thawing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","An, Lingshi(evanlingshi@163.com) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10893032,,,,,28,2015,English,Elastic moduli,,21.0,13375-13392,,2015,E-Journal of Geotechnical Engineering,Electronic Journal of Geotechnical Engineering,,Dynamic parameters of silt subjected to train loading in seasonal frozen region,,Confining pressures - Damping ratio - Dynamic elastic moduli - Dynamic parameters - Dynamic triaxial tests - Freeze-thaw cycles - Loading frequencies - Train loadings,20,
Rock Soil Mech,"The mesoscopic structure of real soil consists of numerous particles with different sizes, and yet the traditional reconstruction method of quartet structure generation set (QSGS) produces relatively uniform soil particles,which has significant discrepancy with the actual mesoscopic structure of soil. In order to remedy this deficiency, the QSGS is improved by considering the influences of porosity and autocorrelative function of soil, so that the mesoscopic structure reconfiguration closer to real soil is obtained. Based on the reconfiguration model combined with Lattice Boltzmann method, the D2Q9 model is applied to construct a two dimensional model for simulating mesoscopic seepage field of reconfiguration soil by setting the non-equilibrium extrapolation scheme at the inlet and outlet boundaries, and the bounce-back scheme at the soil particles' boundary as well as the left and right boundaries. Meanwhile, according to a case study, a corresponding program is developed to simulate mesoscopic seepage field of reconstructed soil with constant inlet seepage velocity. The results show that the pore fluid preferentially flows through the channel with good connectivity. Meanwhile, the flow velocity is controlled by the whole connectivity of the channel. The velocity is much faster in whole-through-channel than that in partial-through-channel. Even if there exists a large pore space, the velocity still depends on whether or not it is on the channel with integral connectivity. © 2015, Academia Sinica.

Minerals Eng,"Abstract Flotation has been used in industry for more than a half century as the primary technique for upgrading phosphate. While the flotation of phosphate was inefficient when oleic acid was used alone as a collector, therefore a mixed collector of oleic acid (HOl), linoleic acid (LA) and linolenic acid (LNA) was employed to improve the recovery of phosphate flotation. The batch flotation results showed that the optimal composition of the mixed collector was 54 wt.% HOl, 36 wt.% LA and 10 wt.% LNA. Additionally, the effect of pH on the mixed collector application was studied while considering the surface tension, contact angle and micro-flotation. The results showed that the mixed collector should be used at a pH of 9.5. Above a pH of 9.5, the adsorption of fatty acids dimers on the apatite surface hindered phosphate flotation. The influence of the mixed collector assembly on apatite flotation was also investigated. It was demonstrated that due to its low critical micelle concentration, a sufficiently hydrophobic apatite surface could be generated at a collector concentration of 60 mg/L. In addition, zeta potential experiments suggested that collector adsorption was governed by chemisorption. FTIR and XPS spectra studies further indicated that the chemical reaction involved the carboxyl groups of fatty acids and Ca species at the apatite surface for each fatty acid in the mixed collector. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,Open Access,20152000849570,4651,"Cao, Qinbo (1); Cheng, Jinhua (1); Wen, Shuming (1); Li, Chengxiu (2); Bai, Shaojun (1); Liu, Dan (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Faculty of Land Resources Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Institute of Mineral Resource Comprehensive Utilization, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China ",MENGEB,482.2 Minerals - 801 Chemistry - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers,,,,,Adsorption - Apatite - Critical micelle concentration - Dimers - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Linoleic acid - Oleic acid,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wen, Shuming(shmwen@126.com) ",10.1016/j.mineng.2015.04.020,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51304089, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20135314120007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: KKSY201221120, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; ","The financial support provided by the Yunnan Province program KKSY201221120 , the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China 20135314120007 and NSF Grant No. 51304089 is gratefully acknowledged.",,08926875,,"July 1, 2015",English,Flotation,,31.0,114-121,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Minerals Engineering,,A mixed collector system for phosphate flotation,,Adsorption mechanism - Adsorption state - Batch flotation - Collector concentrations - Mixed collector systems - Mixed collectors - Optimal composition - Phosphate flotation,78,

Take a wind/photovoltaic/hydropower distributed power generation demonstration project in Yunnan Province as an example. Based on the basic concept of the portfolio, it is proposed to have the output uncertainty of a virtual power plant mapped onto the price uncertainty. On the basis of a single period capacity allocation model, another two models are developed considering the penalty for output deviation and multi-period capacity allocation, respectively. Numerical examples show that the proposed model is effective in quantitatively analyzing the allocation problem by considering the complementary role among multi renewable energy distributed generators, the electricity prices, the reserve price, and risk preference. ©2015 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press",,,20154301433981,,"Huang, Xinying (1, 2); Li, Jian (3); Yang, Li (1); Jiang, Jie (4); Feng, Changsen (1) ","(1) College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (2) State Grid Zhejiang Economic Research Institute, Hangzhou; 310008, China (3) China Guodian Corporation Yunnan Branch, Kunming; 650214, China (4) Jiangshan Power Supply Company of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company, Jiangshan; 324199, China ",DXZIE9,525.1 Energy Resources and Renewable Energy Issues - 706.1.2 Electric Power Distribution - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics,,,,,Costs - Distributed power generation - Renewable energy resources,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Li(eeyangli@zju.com) ",10.7500/AEPS20141110001,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10001026,19,"October 10, 2015",Chinese,Investments,,23.0,75-81,,2015,Automation of Electric Power Systems Press,Dianli Xitong Zidonghua/Automation of Electric Power Systems,,Investment portfolio based multi energy capacity allocation of virtual power plant,,Capacity allocation - Investment portfolio - Renewable energy generation - Uncertainty - Virtual power plants,39,

J. Clean. Prod.,"Different types of hydropower schemes utilize different construction methods and have different carbon footprints. However, differences in carbon footprints between different schemes have been largely ignored when comparing environmental impacts for decision making. Thus, this paper aims to study and compare the carbon footprints of two types of Nuozhadu hydropower schemes with the same scale: an earth-core rockfill dam (ECRD) and a concrete gravity dam (CGD). The hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) method combines the completeness of economic input-output LCA (EIO-LCA) and the specificity of process-based LCA (PA-LCA). It was applied to quantify the carbon footprint over the whole life cycle of the hydropower system. The evaluation of the carbon footprint considered the emissions from material production, transportation, construction, and the operation and maintenance phases for a period of 44 years. All relevant materials and energy consumption were included. It was found that the ECRD reduced CO2emissions by approximately 24.7% compared to the CGD. With respect to each stage of the life cycle, the ECRD decreased CO2emissions by 46.1% for material production, 16.5% for transportation and 9.0% for operation and maintenance but increased emissions by 6.6% for construction due to the heavy workload. Operational maintenance was the greatest contributor to CO2emissions, followed by the production, construction and transportation stages. These results indicate that ECRDs are more environmentally responsible throughout its life cycle. This knowledge could help decision makers in the design phase looking to choose the appropriate type of hydropower system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20143600013949,,"Zhang, Sherong (1); Pang, Bohui (1); Zhang, Zongliang (2, 3, 4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Hydraulic Engineering Simulation and Safety, Tianjin University, Tianjin; 300072, China (2) HYDROCHINA Kunming Engineering Corporation, Kunming; 650051, China (3) High Earth-Rockfill Dam Branch Centre, State Energy Hydropower Technology Research and Development Centre, Kunming; 650051, China (4) Technol.

Dalton Trans.,"The solvothermal reaction of thorium nitrate and tris-(4-carboxylphenyl)phosphine oxide in DMF affords a centrosymmetric porous thorium organic framework compound [Th(TPO)(OH)(H2O)]·8H2O (1). In contrast, the ionothermal reaction of the same reagents in the ionic liquid 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride results in the formation of a rare example of a chiral and porous thorium organic framework compound, [C9H17N2][Th(TPO)Cl2]·18H2O (2), which is derived solely from achiral starting materials. The geometries of the Th(iv) centers in compounds 1 and 2 are both atypical for low valent actinides, which can be best described as a ten-coordinate spherical sphenocorona and an irregular muffin, respectively. A large cavity of 17.5 Å (max. face to face) × 8 Å (min. face to face) with a BET surface area of 623 m2g-1in compound 2 is observed. The poor stability indicated by thermal gravimetric analysis and the water-resistance test for compound 2 may be due to the unique anisotropic coordination geometry for thorium. Temperature-dependent luminescence studies for both compounds indicate that the trends in the intensity vary as the Th-Th distance and the coordination environments of Th(iv) centers change. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20154901648930,,"Li, Yuxiang (1, 3); Weng, Zhehui (2); Wang, Yanlong (3); Chen, Lanhua (3); Sheng, Daopeng (3); Liu, Yunhai (1); Diwu, Juan (3); Chai, Zhifang (3); Albrecht-Schmitt, Thomas E.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"As a NP-hard combinatorial problem, nurse scheduling problem (NSP) is a well-known personnel scheduling task whose goal is to create a nurse schedule under a series of hard and soft constraints in a practical world. In this paper, a variant of structure-redesigned-based bacterial foraging optimization (SRBFO) with a dynamic topology structure (SRBFO-DN) is employed for solving nurse scheduling problem (NSP). In SRBFO-DN, each bacterium achieves cooperation by information exchange mechanism switching the topology structure between star topology and ring topology. A special encoding operation of bacteria in SRBFO-DN is adopted to transform position vectors into feasible solutions, which can make SRBFO-DN successfully dealing with this typical difficult and discrete NSP. Experiment results obtained by SRBFO-DN compared with SRBFO and SPSO demonstrated that the efficiency of the proposed SRBFO-DN algorithm is better than other two algorithms for dealing with NSP. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,20154301446900,,"Niu, Ben (1, 2); Wang, Chao (1); Liu, Jing (1); Gan, Jianhou (3); Yuan, Lingyun (3) ","(1) College of Management, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China (2) Department of Industrial and System Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong (3) Key Laboratory of Educational Information for Nationalities, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China ",,"461.7 Health Care - 721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",139689.0,"August 20, 2015 - August 23, 2015","Fuzhou, China","11th International Conference on Intelligent Computing, ICIC 2015",Bacteria - Computation theory - Intelligent computing - Nursing - Optimization - Scheduling - Topology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Niu, Ben(Drniuben@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-22186-1_69,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319221854.0,03029743,,2015,English,Problem solving,"Intelligent Computing Theories and Methodologies - 11th International Conference, ICIC 2015, Proceedings",13.0,701-707,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),International Neural Network Society; National Science Foundation of China,Improved bacterial foraging optimization algorithm with information communication mechanism for nurse scheduling,,Bacterial foraging optimization - Bacterial foraging optimization algorithms - Dynamic topology structures - Hard and soft constraints - Information communication mechanisms - Information exchanges - Nurse scheduling problems - Topology structure,9226,
J Mater Eng Perform,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of dynamic recovery on the mechanical properties of copper (Cu) during surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) at both room temperature (RT) and cryogenic temperature (CT). Copper sheets were processed by SMAT at RT and at CT for 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively. The Cu samples after SMAT at RT for 30 min exhibited better ductility but lower strength than the samples after SMAT at CT for 30 min due to dynamic recovery. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that decreasing temperature during SMAT led to an increase in the twin and dislocation densities. In addition, a thicker gradient structure layer with finer grains was obtained in the SMAT-processed Cu samples at CT than at RT. The results indicated that SMAT at CT can effectively suppress the occurring of dynamic recovery and produce ultrahigh strength pure copper without seriously sacrificing its ductility. © 2015, ASM International.",,,20154701564453,,"Shen, Yu (1); Wen, Cuie (2); Yang, Xincheng (1); Pang, Yanzhao (1); Sun, Lele (1); Tao, Jingmei (3); Gong, Yulan (3); Zhu, Xinkun (1) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, RMIT University, Bundoora; VIC; 3083, Australia (3) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",JMEPEG,544.1 Copper - 644.4 Cryogenics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Copper - Cryogenics - Ductility - Mechanical properties - Recovery - X ray diffraction analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Xinkun(xk_zhu@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/s11665-015-1797-2,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15441024,,,,10599495,12,"December 1, 2015",English,Dynamics,,33.0,5058-5064,,2015,Springer New York LLC,Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance,,Ultrahigh Strength Copper Obtained by Surface Mechanical Attrition Treatment at Cryogenic Temperature,,Copper sheets - Cryogenic temperatures - Dislocation densities - Dynamic recovery - Finer grains - Gradient structure - Surface mechanical attrition treatments - Ultrahigh strength,24,

J. Cent. South Univ.,"Desulfurization experiments of CuO, γ-Al2O3and CuO/γ-Al2O3were made in simulated flue gas by means of thermogravimetric analysis. It is found that reaction activities of CuO supported on γ-Al2O3could be highly improved. Desulfurization kinetics of CuO/γ-Al2O3was studied in the temperature range of 250 °C-400 °C and SO2 concentration of 0.1%-0.9%. The experimental data were tested and compared with kinetics models of volume reaction model (VRM), grain size model (GSM), random pore model (RPM) and pore-blocking model (PBM). Correlation analysis shows that VRM and RPM models do not fit experimental data well. GSM contradicts with the changes in the physical and chemical properties of CuO/γ-Al2O3as the desulfurization proceeds. It is found that PBM is consistent with the change of pore structure of CuO/γ-Al2O3sorbent during desulfurization process and predicts the conversion-time curves of the sorbent well.

ISPRS Ann. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spat. Inf. Sci.,"Spatiotemporal modelling of land use/cover change (LUCC) has become increasingly important in recent years, especially for environmental change and regional planning. There have been many approaches and software packages for modelling LUCC, but developing a model for a specific region is still a difficult task, because it requires large volume of data input and elaborate model adjustment. Fuxian Lake watershed is one of the most important ecological protection area in China and located in southeast of Kunming city, Yunnan province. In this paper, the CA-Markov model is used to analyse the spatiotemporal LUCC and project its course into the future. Specifically, the model uses high resolution remote sensing images of 2006 and 2009 as input data, and then makes prediction for 2014. A quantitative comparison with remote sensing images of 2014 suggests an overall accuracy of 88%.

J. Internet Technol.,"With the advent of cloud application, cloud computing has become a charged network service, with task scheduling and resource allocation being the most important issues for a cloud service center. In most algorithms, the requirement for QoS (Quality of Service) has not been considered comprehensively. The objective of this paper is to optimize task scheduling and resource allocation, using an improved ant colony optimization algorithm based on the proposed cost and time models in cloud computing environment. An integrated multi-objective efficiency function is proposed to balance the consumptions for resources allocation. An improved ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) algorithm is proposed for use in cloud environment. By means of entropy, the algorithm's convergence rate could be improved in measuring the uncertainty of cloud resources and updating the global pheromone. Besides, it is demonstrated that better resource balance can be obtained during tasks' execution.

Zhongguo Youse Jinshu Xuebao,"The geometries of the MomSn(m+n≤8) clusters were optimized using density functional theory(DFT) with generalized gradient approximation(GGA) for exchange-correlation functional. Several parameters, such as the second difference of energies(Δ2Em), the fission energy(D(m)), average binding energy(Eb), highest occupied molecular orbital(HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO) and the HOMO-LUMO energy gap(HLG), were calculated to characterize and analyze the influence of total atom number on the structural stabilities of MomSnclusters. The calculated results show that the ground state structures change from incompact planar structures to closed-packed structures with the increase of total atom number (m+n), the ground state structures are mainly based on the ground state structures of Snclusters and Momclusters. And the structural stabilities of MomSnclusters increase with the increase of total atom number, and the average binding energy of MomSnclusters is higher than those of Snclusters and Momclusters. when the magic numbers (n) of MoSnclusters, Mo2Snclusters and Mo3Snclusters are 5, 4, and 3, respectively, the charge transfers from Mo atom to S atom in MomSnclusters and the co-existence of covalent and ionic bond can be found. ©, 2015, Central South University of Technology.

Samples characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM, PL and UV-Vis methods. The photocatalytic activity of samples was investigated by photocatalytic degradation of methylene-blue (MB) under the irradiation of fluorescent lamp. The results indicate that C ion and Y ion are incorporated into the lattice of TiO2, and C doping accelerate phase transition from anatase to rutile phase, but Y doping inhabits the phase transition. It was also found that both C and Y doping can broaden the absorption spectrum to visible light region and inhibit the recombination of the photo-generated electron and hole pairs. The synergy effect of co-doped C and Y ions provides C-Y-TiO2sample better photocatalytic activity than that of the single-doped samples and P25 under fluorescent lamp. The photocatalytic activity of the sample with C, Y co-doped is the best under the irradiation of fluorescent light.

Since detected moving object areas are often contain shadow points, errors in measurements, localization, segmentation, classification and tracking may arise from this. A novel shadow elimination algorithm is proposed in this paper. A set of suspected moving object area are detected by the adaptive Gaussian approach.

Kuei Suan Jen Hsueh Pao,"The h-BN-SiC multiphase ceramics were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) with nanopowders of h-BN and SiC as raw materials and B2O3as a sintering aid. The effect of sintering pressure (i.e., 20-50 MPa) on the microstructure and mechanical properties of h-BN-SiC multiphase ceramics was investigated. The results show that the c-axis of h-BN grains is orient parallel to the pressure direction in the h-BN-SiC multiphase ceramics at different sintering pressures. The increase of sintering pressure increases the densification and mechanical properties of h-BN-SiC multiphase ceramics. However, a higher sintering pressure (> 40 MPa) decreases the orientation degree of c-axis orient parallel to pressure direction and fracture toughness. The better comprehensive performance is obtained at 40 MPa, and the relative density, flexural strength and fracture toughness are 98%, 289.2 MPa and 3.45 MPa·m1/2, respectively. Compared to pure h-BN ceramics prepared under the same sintering conditions, the flexural strength and fracture toughness of h-BN-SiC multiphase ceramics prepared are increased by 138.4% and 64.3%, respectively. The fracture mode of h-BN-SiC multiphase ceramics is typical intergranular fracture at different sintering pressures, and the fracture toughness increases due to the micro-crack and crack deflection. ©, 2015, Chinese Ceramic Society.

Polym. Adv. Technol.,"The effects of laponite (0, 1, 2, and 3wt%) on poly(lactic-acid)/poly(trimethylene-carbonate) (PLA/PTMC) composite film properties were studied, and the effects of the use of such composite films on the postharvest quality of mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) were determined. An increase in the laponite contents enhanced the toughness and water vapor permeability (WVP) of the PLA/PTMC/laponite composite films. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicated that the crystallinity of the PLA phase increased by the presence of laponite filler. The PLA/PTMC/laponite composite films reduced the softening of mushrooms, but were not effective at reducing weight loss. The CO2level inside of the PLA/PTMC/laponite composite films was significantly (p2level was similar in all packages. The overall acceptability of mushrooms packed in the PLA/PTMC/L2 and PLA/PTMC/L3 films remained good and within the limits of marketability after 12d of storage. These results support the applicability of laponite filler in PLA/PTMC blend films and the use of these composite films in the packaging of mushrooms. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,20152801019474,,"Liu, Dong (1); Li, Hongli (1); Zhou, Guoxian (1); Yuan, Minglong (1); Qin, Yuyue (2) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Biopolymer Functional Materials of Yunnan, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Institute of Yunnan Food Safety, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650550, China ",,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 944.6 Temperature Measurements,,,,,Carbonation - Differential scanning calorimetry - Fillers - Fungi - Lactic acid,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yuan, Minglong(yml@188.com) ",10.1002/pat.3587,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10991581,,,,10427147,12,"December 1, 2015",English,Composite films,,42.0,1600-1607,,2015,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, United Kingdom",Polymers for Advanced Technologies,,Biodegradable poly(lactic-acid)/poly(trimethylene-carbonate)/laponite composite film: Development and application to the packaging of mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus),,Agaricus bisporus - Development and applications - Overall acceptability - Poly lactic acid - Postharvest quality - Properties - Trimethylene carbonate - Water vapor permeability,26,
Ind. Crops Prod.,"Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a multiuse, multifunctional crop that provides raw material to a large number of traditional and innovative industrial applications. A relatively simple, low input cultivation technique and the sustainability of its products are the main drivers for a future expansion of the hemp crop. In Europe, the large political support of bioenergy in recent years has fuelled numerous studies on the potential cultivation of hemp for bioenergy production. In China the main drivers for a renewed interest in hemp are its traditional applications. For any given destination, the main target of hemp cultivation is the maximization of biomass production, but each end-use destination has specific quality requirements in terms of properties of the bast fibre, characteristics of the oil and proteins in the seeds, or profile of secondary metabolites in the inflorescence.In this paper, traditional and innovative end use destinations and cultivation systems for hemp are introduced, together with some notes on hemp botany, biology, and resource use efficiency. This information, together with a review of the practical experience of hemp cultivation in Europe and China and knowledge gathered form scientific literature, highlights the effect of agronomic factors in determining the yield potential and quality level of hemp for specific end use destinations. To conclude, future perspectives and recommendations for hemp cultivation and research are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20143600023837,,"Amaducci, S. (1); Scordia, D. (2); Liu, F.H.

Carbohydr Polym,"Self-assembled pectin nanoparticles was prepared and evaluated for delivering the hydrophobic drug, honokiol (HK), to HepG2 cells. These hydrophobic drug-loaded nanoparticles were developed without using any surfactant and organic solvent. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HCD) was used to fabricate an inclusion complex with HK (HKHCD) to increase the solubility of the drug and thus facilitate its encapsulation and dispersion in the pectin nanoparticles. Investigation of the in vitro release indicated that the drug-loaded nanoparticles exhibited a higher drug release rate than free honokiol and an effective sustained-release. Cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis and cellular uptake studies further confirmed that the pectin nanoparticles with galactose residues generated higher cytotoxicity than free honokiol on HepG2 cells which highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGR). Nevertheless, these findings were not observed in ASGR-negative A549 cells under similar condition. Therefore, pectin nanoparticles demonstrated a specific active targeting ability to ASGR-positive HepG2 cells and could be used as a potential drug carrier for treatment of liver-related tumors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Guangxue Jingmi Gongcheng,"A measuring method for liquid diffusion coefficients(D) was proposed by an asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens combined with an feature extracting method of optical images in real time automatically. Based on the Software Development Kit provided by a CMOS camera used, the application codes were programmed to extract and analyze the features of the brightness and width of a diffusion image. On the image features, the focal position corresponding to a specific liquid layer with a certain refractive index was found out, and the curve of focal positions varied with diffusion time was recorded automatically. Finally, the diffusion coefficient was calculated by using Fick's second law on the acquired experimental data. With the proposed method, the diffusion process of ethylene glycol with pure water was researched at the room temperature (25) and the measured diffusion coefficient (D) is 1.164×10-5cm2/s, the relative error is only 0.34% that of the literature value. As compared with traditional direction observation method, the obtained results demonstrate that the method avoids the error caused by reading focal position with human eye, implements measurement automation and is characterized by higher measuring speeds and accuracy, shorter computing time and stable measuring results. © 2015, SCIENCE PRESS.

Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc.,"This review assesses storm studies over the North Atlantic and northwestern Europe regarding the occurrence of potential long-term trends. Based on a systematic review of available articles, trends are classified according to different geographical regions, datasets, and time periods. Articles that used measurement and proxy data, reanalyses, regional and global climate model data on past and future trends are evaluated for changes in storm climate. The most important result is that trends in storm activity depend critically on the time period analysed. An increase in storm numbers is evident for the reanalyses period for the most recent decades, whereas most long-term studies show merely decadal variability for the last 100-150 years. Storm trends derived from reanalyses data and climate model data for the past are mostly limited to the last four to six decades. The majority of these studies find increasing storm activity north of about 55-60° N over the North Atlantic with a negative tendency southward. This increase from about the 1970s until the mid-1990s is also mirrored by long-term proxies and the North Atlantic Oscillation and constitutes a part of their decadal variability. Studies based on proxy and measurement data or model studies over the North Atlantic for the past which cover more than 100 years show large decadal variations and either no trend or a decrease in storm numbers. Future scenarios until about the year 2100 indicate mostly an increase in winter storm intensity over the North Atlantic and western Europe. However, future trends in total storm numbers are quite heterogeneous and depend on the model generation used. © 2015 Royal Meteorological Society.",,,20143600007947,,"Feser, F. (1); Barcikowska, M.

Yantu Gongcheng Xuebao,"The relative density of non-cohesive soil has a great impact on the engineering properties of soil. For most studies of mesoscopic simulation by using distinct element method (DEM), the first step of the analysis is to create an initial granular assembly with a desired relative density. Based on the DEM, the loosest state is obtained by depositing particles under gravity firstly. Secondly, a quasi vibration and compaction method (QVC) is proposed to simulate the vibration and compaction method by reducing the friction between the particles during the compaction. And the feasibility of QVC method is validated. The densest state is obtained by reducing the friction to zero. The relationship between the friction and packing porosity is studied. Based on this relationship, the friction which is used to obtain the assembly with desired relative density can be estimated. The results show that the relationship between the coordination number of particle and the particle diameter is compatible with an exponential distribution. By reducing the friction between the particles, the vibration process can be well reflected. The relationship between the friction and the packing porosity agrees with the negative exponential distribution. Based on the proposed method, an initial granular assembly with any desired relative density can be obtained, which can be used for mesoscopic simulation of grained materials. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Civil Engineering.

Acta Geophys. Sin.,"The spatial-temporal distribution characters of trace gases in the stratosphere and troposphere are affected by the Brewer-Dobson (BD) circulation. Understanding the distribution characters of BD circulation is very important to further study the influence of stratosphere and troposphere exchange and forecast the global climate change. The BD circulation is described as the Lagrangian-mean circulation, it is difficult to diagnose directly from meteorological observations. The methods of the transformed Eulerian-mean (TEM) equations, and integrating residual meridional velocity in the vertical were used to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution characters of BD circulation, by using the ERA-Interim reanalysis data for 1979-2011 at 12:00 UTC. We further compared the distribution characters of BD circulation with the result calculated by the method of DC (downward control) principle and studied the relationship between the stratospheric zonal mean temperature and BD circulation. The BD circulation was calculated from ERA-Interim reanalysis data for 1979-2011 by integrating residual meridional velocity in the vertical. The results showed that: (1) The ascending centers of BD circulation were varied with seasons. It ascended at 30°S in the stratosphere for December to February (DJF), for June to August (JJA) it ascended between 25°N and 30°N, the circulation pattern in the winter hemisphere is stronger than the summer hemisphere. In March to May (MAM) and September to November (SON), the ascending center were between equator to 5°N, and circulation were relatively symmetrically for two hemispheres. (2) The maximum mass flux in the tropical and extratropical northern hemisphere appeared during DJF, the minimum appeared during JJA. The mass flux in extratropical southern hemisphere was just the opposite. Mass flux across the 100 hPa and 50 hPa pressure surface in tropical and extratropical trended to decreasing, and also had obviously seasonal variation. (3) The long-term trend of stratospheric zonal mean temperature was consistent with the long-term weakening trend of BD circulation, this indicated that the global BD circulation has been weakened. Meanwhile, the zonal mean temperature in different altitude and latitude bands varied with seasons. From the perspective of the global mass transportation, the stratospheric BD circulation has been weakened in the past 33 years, especially in the middle and lower stratosphere, and was consistent with the long-term trend of temperature. This weakened trend was consistent with the observation study in the age of stratospheric air and other model results. But the method of DC principle, GCMs model and other studies showed that the stratospheric BD circulation has been enhanced in the past years. Using different methods and data would lead the trend estimation of BD circulation were unreliable. Therefore, further research will be required to improve the reliability of BD circulation. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Procedia Comput. Sci.,"Photovoltaic generation is one of the promising renewable sources and is deployed in more and more power systems. Like other distributed generation, solar panels are connected to distribution systems instead of transmission systems. Distribution systems are inherently unbalanced, so the power flow studies must consider three phases. The interface between solar panel and distribution system is a DC-DC converter and an inverter, which are normally designed provided that the system is balanced. This paper analyses the output power of solar panel under both balanced and unbalanced PCC voltages and found the three-phase powers are not equal and unity power factor control cannot be realized when PCC voltages are unbalanced while the controller works well when PCC voltages are balanced. The results of simulation conform to the analysis. The work of this paper shows that simple P-Q solar panel models are not good for distribution system power flow studies, and present unity power factor controller does not work well for solar panel connected to distribution systems. © 2015 The Authors.

Anal. Methods,"A series of ordered mesoporous silica loaded with samarium oxide (Sm-MCM-41) were synthesized by a facile one-step sol-gel route using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source, and hexahydrated samarium chloride as the precursor. The as-synthesized materials with the Sm/Si molar ratio ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N2adsorption-desorption measurements. All obtained compounds possess an ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure with a high surface area, a large pore volume, and uniform pore size. The mesoporous composites were used as the novel adsorbents for phosphate ion (H2PO4-) removal from synthetic aqueous solutions. The phosphate removal capacity of Sm-MCM-41 with a Sm/Si molar ratio of 0.6 was up to 20 mg P/g.

RSC Adv.,"Hierarchical Bi2WO6nanoarchitectures with a size of 2-3 μm were prepared via a facile microwave-assisted solution-phase reaction process. Monodisperse spherical Ag2CO3nanoparticles with an average size of about 10 nm were deposited onto the surface of the Bi2WO6nanoarchitectures to form a novel Ag2CO3/Bi2WO6heterojunction structure through a facile in situ precipitation-deposition method. The obtained samples were characterized using XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM (HRTEM), UV-vis DRS and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. The photocatalytic evaluation demonstrates that the decoration with Ag2CO3nanoparticles significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6and the photocatalytic performance is greatly influenced by the content of deposited Ag2CO3. The 30 wt% Ag2CO3-loaded Bi2WO6sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, it also possesses excellent cycling stability and superior photocatalytic performance toward other pollutants. The dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability can be mainly ascribed to well-matched energy bands and heterojunctions between Ag2CO3and Bi2WO6, which can effectively improve the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs at the heterojunction interfaces. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20154801615736,,"Bao, Jianxing (1, 2, 3); Guo, Shenghui (1, 2, 3); Gao, Jiyun (4); Hu, Tu (1, 2, 3); Yang, Li (1, 2, 3); Liu, Chenhui (4); Peng, Jinhui (1, 2, 3, 4); Jiang, Caiyi (1, 2, 3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Natl.

Gaodianya Jishu,"Insulation failures of gas insulated switchgear(GIS) due to very fast transient overvoltages (VFTOs) is increasingly frequent. To optimize the design of GIS insulation structure, we developed a steep fronted impulse generator, and used it to study the discharges of SF6rod-plate gap under VFTO and lightning impulses (LI). The results show that the discharges of SF6gap in both quasi-uniform field and highly inhomogeneous electric field present obvious polarity features. In quasi-uniform field, the 50% breakdown voltages (U50%) of positive VFTO and positive LI are higher than those of negative overvoltages, respectively. However, in highly inhomogeneous electric field, the discharge in SF6induced by LI shows reversion of the polarity effect with the increase of SF6pressure: when the pressure is lower, the breakdown voltage under negative LI is higher than that under positive LI, but when the pressure exceeds a certain value, the breakdown voltage under positive LI turns out to be higher than that under negative LI. This critical pressure of polarity reversion is related to electric field inhomogeneity: it decreases with the increase of electric field inhomogeneity. Meanwhile, in highly inhomogeneous electric field, U50%of negative VFTO is higher than that of positive unless the SF6is below a critical value. Further analysis indicates that the polarity effects are mainly due to difference in the migration and diffusion of space charges between gaps influenced by overvoltages of different polarities. ©, 2015, Science Press.

The k · p approach is employed to calculate the energy spectra and wave functions for both the bulk and surface states in the TITF. With these obtained results, the optical conductivities induced by different electronic transitions among the bulk and surface states are evaluated using the energy-balance equation derived from the Boltzmann equation. We find that for Bi2Se3-based TITFs, three characteristic regimes for the optical absorption can be observed. (i) In the low radiation frequency regime (photon energy ω 300 meV), the optical absorption can be achieved via interband electronic transitions from bulk and surface states in the valance band to bulk and surface states in the conduction band. A strong absorption peak can be observed.

Int. J. Model. Ident. Control,"The tuning of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for hydraulic turbine governing system is a constrained engineering problem. The PID control parameters must be adjusted to capture the requirements of achieving satisfactory transient behaviour, robust stability, and disturbance rejection, which are all essential aspects for hydraulic turbine control. An optimal tuning method for robust PID controller based on the augmented Lagrangian (AL) algorithm and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is presented in this paper. The AL is extended by incorporating the PSO in a seamless manner. Moreover, it introduces a new updated strategy for the penalty factor and embeds a local search procedure within the algorithm framework to enhance the search capability and accuracy, so that the optimal control parameters can be reliably obtained from the search space. The results of the simulation experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of this improved AL algorithm in producing a robust PID controller that provides system stability over a wide range of operating conditions.

Nanotechnology,"The dependence of the electronic properties of a single Ge/Si quantum dot (QD) grown by the ion-beam sputtering deposition technique on growth temperature and QD diameter is investigated by conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM). The Si-Ge intermixing effect is demonstrated to be important for the current distribution of single QDs. The current staircase induced by the Coulomb blockade effect is observed at higher growth temperatures (>700°C) due to the formation of an additional barrier between dislocated QDs and Si substrate for the resonant tunneling of holes. According to the proposed single-hole-tunneling model, the fact that the intermixing effect is observed to increase as the incoherent QD size decreases may explain the increase in the starting voltage of the current staircase and the decrease in the current step width. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,20151000606072,105201,"Wang, C.

Evidence classification discount algorithm is given priority if there's no hidden conflict, otherwise, main element of evidence discount algorithm will be used to modify the source of evidence, and synthetic fault diagnosis conclusion will be made by Dempster rules.

It is found that most of the S2−removed by adding sodium nitrate or hydrogen peroxide in digestion process, and in this way the effect of S2−on alumina product quality is eliminated. However, the removal efficiency of S2O32−in sodium aluminate solution is very low by this method.

IEEE Trans Dielectr Electr Insul,"The MIE (Minimum Ignition Energy) characterizes the danger of a kind of combustible gas and its ignition behavior, and the antistatic test for the non-metallic materials is of great value to mining industry. This paper describes an antistatic level testing system for the non-metallic materials used in mines, and the methods to calculate the MIE of the ignition system, electromagnetic energy and scale the antistatic grade are also presented in details. According to the structure of the antistatic level testing system, the model to calculate the electromagnetic energy of the ignition system is set up firstly, then the MIE and electromagnetic energy before and after ignition are computed respectively. The ignition energy coupling coefficient is defined to indicate the ratio between the energy used for ignition and the total electromagnetic energy, based on which the quantity of triboelectric charge produced by the testing material can be obtained. The numerical relation between the ignition energy coupling coefficient and electrode gap is investigated, for the system described in the paper the threshold of ignition energy coupling coefficient increases from 0.42 to 0.77 when the gap distance increases from 1 mm to 5 mm. The system designed in the paper can be used to test the possibility of ignition and explosion for non-metallic devices used in mine, and the safety limit space for different material can be determined.

,"YPO4: Tm, Yb inverse opal photonic crystals were successfully synthesized by the colloidal crystal templates method, and the visible-infrared quantum cutting (QC) photoluminescence properties of YPO4: Tm, Yb inverse opal photonic crystals were investigated. We obtained tetragonal phase YPO4in all the samples when the samples sintered at 950°C for 5 h. The visible emission intensity of Tm3+decreased significantly when the photonic bandgap was located at 650 nm under 480 nm excitation. On the contrary, the QC emission intensity of Yb3+was enhanced as compared with the no photonic bandgap sample. When the photonic bandgap was located at 480 nm, the Yb3+and Tm3+light-emitting intensity weakened at the same time. We demonstrated that the energy transfer between Tm3+and Yb3+is enhanced by the suppression of the red emission of Tm3+.

IEEE Trans. Neural Networks Learn. Sys.,"Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) involves within-class and between-class covariance matrices. For 2-D data such as images, regularized LDA (RLDA) can improve LDA due to the regularized eigenvalues of the estimated within-class matrix. However, it fails to consider the eigenvectors and the estimated between-class matrix. To improve these two matrices simultaneously, we propose in this paper a new two-stage method for 2-D data, namely a bidirectional LDA (BLDA) in the first stage and the RLDA in the second stage, where both BLDA and RLDA are based on the Fisher criterion that tackles correlation. BLDA performs the LDA under special separable covariance constraints that incorporate the row and column correlations inherent in 2-D data. The main novelty is that we propose a simple but effective statistical test to determine the subspace dimensionality in the first stage. As a result, the first stage reduces the dimensionality substantially while keeping the significant discriminant information in the data. This enables the second stage to perform RLDA in a much lower dimensional subspace, and thus improves the two estimated matrices simultaneously. Experiments on a number of 2-D synthetic and real-world data sets show that BLDA+RLDA outperforms several closely related competitors. © 2012 IEEE.",,,20153001056180,6892968,"Zhao, Jianhua (1); Shi, Lei (1); Zhu, Ji (2) ","(1) School of Statistics and Mathematics, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (2) Department of Statistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; MI; 48109, United States ",,401.2 Tunnels and Tunneling - 921 Mathematics - 922 Statistical Methods,,,,,Covariance matrix - Discriminant analysis - Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions - Tunneling (excavation),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2350993,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),21622388,,,,2162237X,8,"August 1, 2015",English,Image enhancement,,29.0,1669-1681,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,,Two-Stage Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis for 2-D Data,,2-D data - Dimension reduction - Linear discriminant analyses (LDA) - regularization - separable covariance,26,
Earth Surf. Processes Landf.,"To quantify spatiotemporal variation in hydraulic properties of bank gully concentrated flow, a series of scour experiments were run under water discharge rates ranging from 30 to 120 l min-1. Concentrated flows were found to be turbulent and supercritical in the upstream catchment area and downstream gully beds. As discharge increased, values of the soil erosion rate, Reynolds number (Re), shear stress, stream power, and flow energy consumption (ΔE) increased while values of the Froude number (Fr) and the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (resistance f) did not. With the exception of gully headcut collapse under discharge rates of 60, 90, and 120 l min-1, a declining power function trend (P u) was observed in bank gullies and the upstream catchment area as the experiment progressed, further illustrating the actual reason behind the discrepancy in temporal variation between soil erosion rates and ΔE. Results demonstrate that ΔE can be used to estimate headcut erosion soil loss, but further quantitative studies are required to quantify coupling effects between hydraulic properties and vertical variation in soil mechanical properties on temporal variation for bank gully soil erosion rates. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,20151500734456,,"Su, Zhengan (1); Xiong, Donghong (1); Dong, Yifan (1); Zhang, Baojun (1); Zhang, Su (1, 2); Zheng, Xueyong (1); Yang, Dan (1); Zhang, Jianhui (1); Fan, Jianrong (1); Fang, Haidong (3) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Mountain Hazards and Earth Surface Processes, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, China (2) College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China (3) Institute of Tropical Eco-agricultural Sciences, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yuanmou, China ",ESPLDB,"442.1 Flood Control - 481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General",,,,,Catchments - Energy utilization - Erosion - Flow of fluids - Landforms - Reynolds number - Runoff - Shear flow - Shear stress - Soils,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xiong, Donghong(dhxiong@imde.ac.cn) ",10.1002/esp.3724,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10969837,,,,01979337,10,"August 1, 2015",English,Rivers,,45.0,1351-1363,,2015,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, United Kingdom",Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,,Hydraulic properties of concentrated flow of a bank gully in the dry-hot valley region of southwest China,,Bank gully - Dry-hot valleys - Hydraulic properties - Logarithmic growth - Soil mechanical properties - Spatio-temporal variation - Steady-state condition - Temporal variation,40,
Guangzi Xuebao,"To investigate the protein, polysaccharide and other nutrient substance in corn pollen, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combined with curve-fitting analysis was used to investigate two species of hybrid corn pollen, which called Quchen-9 and Jingfeng-3. The Fourier transform infrared spectra of corn pollen presented the characteristic absorption bands of protein and polysaccharide obviously. The peaks at 1653 cm-1, 1546 cm-1and 1241 cm-1were assigned to amide-I band, amide-II band and amide-III band respectively, which come from protein of corn pollen. The peaks at 1078 cm-1, 1056 cm-1, 1030 cm-1and 995 cm-1were characteristic absorption bands of pollen polysaccharide. Compared with these characteristic absorption bands at the spectra of Quchen 9 and Jingfeng 3, there were obvious differences between the two species of corn pollen. It indicated that the concentration of protein and polysaccharide in corn pollen had difference between the species of Quchen-9 and Jingfeng-3. Fourier self-deconvolution and second derivative of the 1 900~950 cm-1band was followed by curve-fitting analysis to generate the underlying multi-component peaks. The relative area percentages of multi-component peaks showed that the polysaccharide content in the corn pollen of Quchen-9 was higher than that of the Jingfeng-3. However, the relationship of protein content was reverse. The present results suggest that Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is a promising method to identify nutrient substance in corn pollen. ©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

Ranliao Huaxue Xuebao J. Fuel Chem. Technol.,"TiO2-SnO2mixed oxide was prepared by a co-precipitation method and xCeO2/TiO2-SnO2catalysts were prepared using the impregnation method. The physicochemical properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET specific surface area measurement, H2temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Meanwhile, their catalytic performance for the selective catalytic reduction of NOxwith NH3(NH3-SCR) was tested. It was found that 0.1Ce/TiO2-SnO2had higher NOxconversion and wider temperature range of 250~350. Excess loading of CeO2could lead to the decrease of specific surface area, redox ability and adsorption capacity of ammonia as well as the shrink of effective catalytic temperature range. NH3-TPD result showed that the adsorption of NH3in weak acid and medium acid sites were significantly enhanced by CeO2, which was related to the decrease of NH3-SCR reaction temperature. In situ DRIFTS indicated that the strength of Lewis acid sites and Brønsted acid Sites were markedly enhanced for xCeO2/TiO2-SnO2catalyst. Besides, new Brønsted acid Sites appeared at 1657~1666 cm-1and NH4+played the dominant role in the SCR reaction. © 2015, Science Press.

Anal. Methods,"A sensitive electrochemical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanocluster (AgNC) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was developed. rGO and AgNC nanomaterials with excellent conductivity, catalytic activity and biocompatibility offered an extremely hydrophilic surface, which facilitated the immobilization of AChE to fabricate the organophosphorus pesticide biosensor. Carboxylic chitosan (CChit) was used as a cross-linker to immobilize AChE on a rGO and AgNC modified GCE. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCl. Based on the inhibition effect of organophosphorus pesticides on the AChE activity, using phoxim as a model compound, the inhibition effect of phoxim was proportional to its concentration ranging from 0.2 to 250 nM with a detection limit of 81 pM estimated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.

We launch here the experimental realization of a class of DSSCs consisting of polyaniline (PANi) incorporated TiO2anodes, PANi counter electrodes (CEs), and iodide doped PANi solid-state electrolytes. The PANi filled in photoanode can inject electrons for dye recovery, whereas the PANi CE fulfills the function of reducing triiodide into iodide ions. In particular, the solid PANi electrolyte has an ability of catalyzing triiodide species, shortening charge diffusion path length, and recovering dye molecules at anode/electrolyte interface. The photovoltaic performances are optimized by adjusting assembly process and lithium iodide dosage, yielding a maximum efficiency as high as 3.1% in the resultant DSSC device accompanied with fast start-up, multiple start/stop cycling, and good stability under persistent irradiation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Mater Sci Semicond Process,"In order to achieve the purpose of further improving the photocatalytic performance of sulfur (S)-doped anatatse titanium dioxide (TiO2) and providing an example to design an efficient photocatalyst, the electronic and optical properties of pure, S-doped, tantalum (Ta)-doped and S+Ta-codoped anatase TiO2were systematically investigated by using the density functional theory within a GGA+U method. The results indicate that Ta codoping could improve the S incorporated into TiO2lattice under reducing conditions. And the incorporation of Ta into S-doped TiO2further increases the photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation compared with that of the S-doped TiO2: the distance from S-related impurity energy levels to the top of valence band is obviously decreased in S+Ta-codoped TiO2; and the calculated band gap of S+Ta-codoped TiO2is smaller than that of S-doped TiO2; furthermore, through the synergistic effects between S and Ta, S+Ta-codoped TiO2not only has the similar high absorption rate to S-doped TiO2in the UV-light region, but also has higher absorption rate than S/Ta-doped TiO2in the visible-light region. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20150700535462,,"Liu, Qing-Lu (1, 3); Zhao, Zong-Yan (2); Liu, Qing-Ju (3) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Micro/Nano Materials and Technology, Research Institute of Engineering and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,543.4 Tantalum and Alloys - 741.1 Light/Optics - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Density functional theory - Design for testability - Doping (additives) - Electronic structure - Energy gap - Light - Optical properties - Photocatalysis - Photocatalysts - Sulfur dioxide - Tantalum,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Zong-Yan(zzy@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.mssp.2015.01.046,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51262030, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51062017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 51062017 and 51262030 ).,,13698001,,May 2015,English,Titanium dioxide,,36.0,94-102,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing,,"Impact of sulfur-, tantalum-, or co-doping on the electronic structure of anatase titanium dioxide: A systematic density functional theory investigation",,Co-doping - DFT calculation - Electronic and optical properties - Photocatalytic activities - Photocatalytic performance - TiO2 - Titanium dioxides (TiO2) - Visible-light irradiation,33,
Ceram Int,"Transition metal carbides have unique physical and chemical properties and been widely used in engineering parts that need to work under high temperatures and pressures. o-Mo2C, h-Mo2C and t-Mo2C are three critical molybdenum carbides polymorphs while remaining are largely unknown in their mechanical anisotropy, hardness and thermal properties. In this work, we investigated systematically the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of these three candidate carbides using first principles calculations based on density functional theory. Our results showed that the bonds in these compounds were mainly of metallic and covalent type. The Gibbs free energy analysis showed thermodynamically stable structures for all the three carbides. Their shear moduli were estimated to range from 149.1 to 153.4 GPa and hardnesses were expected to be less than 20 GPa. Youngs moduli were analyzed to have more anisotropic features than bulk modulus for all the three compounds. In addition, heat capacities were calculated to predominate by phonon excitations at high temperature but electron excitations at low temperatures near 0 K. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",,,20145200373215,,"Liu, Yangzhen (1); Jiang, Yehua (1); Zhou, Rong (1); Liu, Xifeng (2); Feng, Jing (3) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester; MN; 55905, United States (3) School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge; MA; 02138, United States ",CINNDH,531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921 Mathematics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Anisotropy - Calculations - Carbides - Density functional theory - Elastic moduli - Free energy - Gibbs free energy - Hardness - Temperature - Thermodynamic properties - Transition metals,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jiang, Yehua ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.167,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51261013, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51171074, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No: 51171074 and 51261013 ).,,02728842,4,"May 1, 2015",English,Molybdenum compounds,,34.0,5239-5246,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Ceramics International,,Elastic and thermodynamic properties of Mo2C polymorphs from first principles calculations,,Ab initio calculations - Ceramics - First-principles calculation - Mechanical anisotropy - Molybdenum carbide - Physical and chemical properties - Thermodynamically stable - Transition metal carbide,41,
AIP Adv.,"In this letter, we report the design, demonstration and discussion of a multi- and broad- band metamaterial absorber (MMA) with wide angle polarization insensitive at microwave region. The MMA consisting of double layered electric ring resonator (ERR) with four fold rotational symmetry structure is used to realize a desirable absorption. Strong triple absorption peaks in 2∼8 GHz and broadband microwave absorption in 10∼18 GHz are demonstrated. The absorption can be reached as high as 0.73, 0.73 and 0.94 at 4.41, 5.15, 6.37 GHz, respectively. The multiband absorbing features originate from the synergetic effects of dipole resonance and Fabry-Pérot interference between two or three metasurfaces. This design is of high practical for constructing broad band and multiband absorber for electromagnetic intereference/compatibility (EMI/EMC) applications. © 2015 Author(s).",,Open Access,20152701001392,067151,"Li, Wangchang (1); Zhou, Xiang (1); Ying, Yao (1); Qiao, Xiaojing (2); Qin, Faxiang (3); Li, Qian (4); Che, Shenglei (1) ","(1) Research Center of Magnetic and Electronic Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou; 310014, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing; 100081, China (3) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (4) Yunnan Land and Resources Vocational College, Kunming; 652501, China ",,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Metamaterials - Optical resonators,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Wangchang(wcli@zjut.edu.cn) ",10.1063/1.4923194,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),21583226,,,,,6,"June 1, 2015",English,Polarization,,27.0,,,2015,American Institute of Physics Inc.,AIP Advances,,Polarization-insensitive wide-angle multiband metamaterial absorber with a double-layer modified electric ring resonator array,,Absorption peaks - Dipole resonances - Metamaterial absorbers - Microwave absorption - Microwave region - Polarization-insensitive - Rotational symmetries - Synergetic effect,5,

IEEE Trans. Compon. Packag. Manufact. Tech.,"We investigate the application of perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) packaging for a nonsmooth perfect electric conductor surface, caused by metalized via holes. The PMC shielding is artificially built by a metal lid of pins, based on the gap waveguide (GW) technology. As a foundation, the effects of via hole in a unit cell are studied first considering its diameter, substrate thickness, pin size, pin height, as well as relative position between the via hole and the pin. The via adjacent space and pin rows are also considered for a general grounded coplanar waveguide along with ground vias. The effectiveness of package for such a transmission line containing metalized via holes is then verified experimentally. It is shown that the measured performance agrees well with the simulation.

In the classification of 11 POF species, POC achieved 97.64% of 10-fold cross validation accuracy. Besides, we also propose a new POF dataset consisting of 100 samples for each species and illustrated the prediction performance of several renowned classifiers such as Naïve Bayes, K-nearest and Decision Tree.

IEEE Trans Appl Supercond,"Superconducting magnets are key components to store energy for a superconducting magnet energy storage system (SMES). The quench of superconducting magnets will affect the normal operation of SMES, and even damage the device. So a quick and precise quench detection is needed to ensure the safety of SMES. During the dynamic power compensation, the current flowing in the superconducting magnet is not constant, and shows high frequency components due to the switching of the converter. This paper proposes a flux induction based quench detection method that can compensate nearly all the inductive voltage and electromagnetic noise. Furthermore, it can be used to locate the exact quench position. The principle of this new method is analyzed, and a quench detection scheme for a 35 kJ HTS SMES is designed.

Mater. Sci. Eng. A,"This paper reports the influence of gradient structure volume fraction on the tensile mechanical behaviors of pure copper processed by surface mechanical attrition treatment at cryogenic temperature. Superior combinations of tensile strength and ductility are observed in a certain volume fraction, in which strain hardening uprising after yielding is also observed. The gradient structure produces a synergetic strengthening and extra work hardening. These findings suggest the existence of an optimum volume fraction of gradient structure for the best mechanical properties. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20154201400535,,"Yang, Xincheng (1); Ma, Xiaolong (2); Moering, Jordan (2); Zhou, Hao (2); Wang, Wei (1); Gong, Yulan (1); Tao, Jingmei (1); Zhu, Yuntian (2, 3); Zhu, Xinkun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh; NC; 27695, United States (3) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing; 210094, China ",,537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 544.1 Copper - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Copper - Ductility - Mechanical properties - Strain hardening - Tensile strength,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Yuntian(ytzhu@ncsu.edu) ",10.1016/j.msea.2015.08.037,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: W911 NF-12-1-0009, Acronym: ARO, Sponsor: Army Research Office; Number: 51361017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 50874056, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 50874056 and 51361017 ).

J Lumin,"A series of novel Eu2+/Mn2+co-doped color-tunable Sr3La(PO4)3phosphors were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The photoluminescence properties and energy transfer process were investigated in detail. Two emission bands attributed to the Eu2+and Mn2+ions are observed under UV light excitation via an efficient energy transfer (ET) process. When the Eu2+doping content is fixed, the emission chromaticity can be varied from blue to red by simply adjusting the content of Mn2+. The photoluminescence and lifetime analysis indicate that there is an efficient energy transfer from the Eu2+to Mn2+ions via a quadrupole-quadrupole mechanism with the critical distance of ~10 Å. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20160501859944,,"Zhang, Xinguo (1, 2); He, Pei (3); Zhou, Liya (1); Pang, Qi (1); Shi, Jianxin (2); Gong, Menglian (2) ","(1) School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning; 530004, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China (3) Key Lab of Tobacco Chemistry of Yunnan, Yunnan Academy of Tobacco Science, Kunming; 650106, China ",JLUMA8,525.2 Energy Conservation - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions,,,,,Energy transfer - High temperature applications - Lanthanum compounds - Phosphors - Photoluminescence - Solid state reactions - Strontium compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Xinguo(mpcc1@qq.com) ",10.1016/j.jlumin.2014.09.011,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: GXKFJ12-17, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; Number: 2014GXNSFBA118046, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province; Number: -, Acronym: SYSU, Sponsor: Sun Yat-sen University; ","This research was supported by Guangxi Natural Science Foundation (Grant no. 2014GXNSFBA118046 ), and Ministry-province jointly constructed cultivation base for State Key Laboratory of Processing for nonferrous metal and featured materials, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Grant no.

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"A multilevel model for ordinal data in generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) framework is developed to account for the inherent dependencies among observations within clusters. Motivated by a data set from the British Social Attitudes Panel Survey (BSAPS), the random district effects and respondent effects are incorporated into the linear predictor to accommodate the nested clusterings. The fixed (random) effects are estimated (predicted) by maximizing the penalized quasi likelihood (PQL) function, whereas the variance component parameters are obtained via the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation method. The model is employed to analyze the BSAPS data. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of estimators. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20181304943894,,"Chan, Moon-tong (1); Yu, Dalei (2, 3); Yau, Kelvin K.W.

Carbohydr Polym,"Abstract We present the use of a natural derivative, dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose (DCMC) as the cross-linker for the preparation of spongy collagen cryogels by freezing-thawing method. The DCMC has been characterized by laser light scattering (LLS), showing the molecular weight of 2.38 × 105g/mol. FT-IR studies demonstrate that the cross-linking reaction and the cryogenic treatment do not destroy the triple helix of collagen. SEM images indicate that the cryogel has a heterophase structure with interconnecting macropores. DSC measurements reveal that the incorporation of a very small amount of DCMC can significantly improve the thermal stability of collagen. Moreover, the cryogels exhibit fast swelling rate, and their equilibrium swelling ratio is related to DCMC content and pH-dependent. The in vitro blood-compatibility tests prove that the introduction of DCMC does not cause the reducing performance in hemolysis and blood clotting compared with pure collagen. Hence, the low-cost and non-toxic nature of DCMC confers the cryogel great potential in tissue engineering and other biomedical applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152000845313,9860,"Tan, Huan (1, 2); Wu, Bo (3); Li, Changpeng (1); Mu, Changdao (1); Li, Hongli (2, 4); Lin, Wei (2) ","(1) Department of Pharmaceutical and Bioengineering, School of Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610065, China (2) Key Laboratory of Leather Chemistry and Engineering of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610065, China (3) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou; 510640, China (4) Engineering Research Center of Biopolymer Functional Materials of Yunnan, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650031, China ",CAPOD8,"461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 644.4 Cryogenics - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives - 911 Cost and Value Engineering; Industrial Economics",,,,,Blood - Cellulose - Cost engineering - Crosslinking - Cryogenics - Light scattering - Medical applications - Thermodynamic stability - Tissue engineering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Hongli(hongli.li1982@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.04.029,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013AA06A306, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: USTC, Sponsor: University of Science and Technology of China; Number: 21176159, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 81460542, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: USTC, Sponsor: University of Science and Technology of China; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ((NNSFC) 21176159 , 81460542 ) and National High-tech Research and Development Program (863 program) of China ( 2013AA06A306 ).

Inf Sci,"Concepts are the most fundamental units of cognition in philosophy and how to learn concepts from various aspects in the real world is the main concern within the domain of conceptual knowledge presentation and processing. In order to improve efficiency and flexibility of concept learning, in this paper we discuss concept learning via granular computing from the point of view of cognitive computing. More precisely, cognitive mechanism of forming concepts is analyzed based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology, including how to model concept-forming cognitive operators, define cognitive concepts and establish cognitive concept structure. Granular computing is then combined with the cognitive concept structure to improve efficiency of concept learning. Furthermore, we put forward a cognitive computing system which is the initial environment to learn composite concepts and can integrate past experiences into itself for enhancing flexibility of concept learning. Also, we investigate cognitive processes whose aims are to deal with the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,,20150700513252,,"Li, Jinhai (1); Mei, Changlin (2); Xu, Weihua (3); Qian, Yuhua (4) ","(1) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi; 710049, China (3) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing; 400054, China (4) Key Lab. of Computational Intelligence and Chinese Information Processing of Ministry of Education, School of Computer and Information Technology, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi; 030006, China ",ISIJBC,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921 Mathematics - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Approximation algorithms - Efficiency - Granular computing - Rough set theory,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Jinhai(jhlixjtu@163.com) ",10.1016/j.ins.2014.12.010,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 14118760, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 61322211, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61202018, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61305057, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61203283, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and helpful suggestions which lead to a significant improvement on the manuscript.

J. Atmos. Sol.-Terr. Phys.,"The characteristics of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning for nine hailstorms in Yunnan province of China are analyzed statistically. It is determined that the hailstorms were found to present dominant negative CG lightning flashes at any given stage. One specific hailstorm occurring on July 16, 2006, is analyzed in detail by using the data from a CG lightning location network and Doppler radar. This severe hailstorm, which exhibited strong vertical development with cloud tops reaching 15.9 km, produced hailstones as large as 15 mm and had a lifespan of 3 h and 12 min. The total CG lightning within the hailstorm showed high levels of activity with flash rates of up to 79 fl/5 min. The analysis of the storm cell's lifecycle shows similar trends between the CG lightning flash rates and radar-derived parameters. Cloud-to-ground flashes tended to initiate within the cloud region with reflectivity of more than 30 dBZ at the -10 °C isotherm height. A distinct increase in CG flash rate is shown during the rapid development stages of hailstorms. The CG lightning jump pattern appears to be an effective tool for short-term forecasting of possible occurrences of severe weather. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20155201719596,,"Xie, Yiran (1, 2); Wu, Jian (1); Liu, Xuetao (2); Zhang, Tengfei (3); Xie, Yinjian (4); Xu, Yinjie (2); Zhao, Deming (5) ","(1) Department of Atmospheric Science, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Meteorological Observatory of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650034, China (3) Yunnan Weather Modification Center, Kunming; 650034, China (4) Jianchuan Vocational Senior High School, Jianchuan; 671300, China (5) Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing; 100029, China ",,443 Meteorology - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,,,,,Doppler radar - Lightning - Lightning protection - Storms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Jian(wujian@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jastp.2015.10.011,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014RA002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: K-YN2013-186, Acronym: CSPG, Sponsor: China Southern Power Grid; Number: 41305002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41265001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 41305002 and 41265001 ) and the Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province (No. 2014RA002 ) and the  Science Foundation of the China Southern Power Grid (Grant no.

The effect of the AuNPs on the enhancement upconversion and near-infrared emission in Er3+/Yb3+co-doped transparent glass-ceramics under 980 nm laser diode excitation were investigated. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph showed the average diameter size of gold nanoparticles is estimated about 4-6 nm. Compared with the glass-ceramics sample without HAuCl4, the upconversion and near-infrared emissions intensity of SAB glass-ceramics samples with HAuCl4were significantly increased. Particularly, the red UC emission intensity band centered at 850 nm strongly increased about twenty-fold with the increase of HAuCl4concentration and reaches its maximum at 1.5 mol%, then decreases due to the self-quenching effect. The possible mechanism responsible for the enhancement of upconversion and near-infrared emission in Er3+/Yb3+co-doped due to effectiveness of surface plasmon resonance were discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

IAHS-AISH Publ.,"To achieve good water conservancy under the well-off society before 2020, the future water conservancy planning is undergoing in Yunnan Province. In this study, by analysing the research results of domestic relevant water evaluation index systems and combining this with the water conservancy construction key of Yunnan Province, an unique evaluation index system was proposed to evaluate the welloff water conservancy level of Yunnan Province. It is composed of three levels which are the target layer, criterion layer and index layer. And the criterion layer includes six systems, namely flood control and drought relief mitigation, reasonable allocation of water resources, highly effective water utilization, water source protection and river health security, water management and securing of water development. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the weight of each index. According to the present situation of water development and the related water conservancy planning in Yunnan Province, the target value of each index and evaluation standards are put forward for Yunnan Province in 2020. The results show that the evaluation results are consistent with the actual condition of water development in Yunnan Province and can be used to examine the effects of well-off water conservancy planning.

The study of the semihyperbolic patches of solutions for the Euler system was initiated by Li and Zheng [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 201 (2011), pp. 1069-1096].

Phys. Rev. Appl.,"In typical organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), the device turn-on voltages are above the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of emitters. This paper reports that various combinations of active materials can be strategically selected to construct OLEDs with device working voltages below the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of emitters; i.e., emitted photon energies are higher than applied electrical energies. The operation mechanism of this type of OLED is found to be related to ballistic Auger-electron injection at organic heterojunctions. This Auger-electron injection acts as a built-in voltage booster. The Auger-electron process predicts that the turn-on voltage scales linearly with the energy difference between an acceptor's LUMO and a donor's HOMO. This prediction is in excellent agreement with experimental data. © 2015 ca. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,,20191306692710,054011,"He, Shou-Jie (1, 2); Wang, Deng-Ke (1, 2); Jiang, Nan (1, 2); Zhang, Jin (1, 2); Lu, Zheng-Hong (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory for Micro, Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (3) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto; ON; M5S 3E4, Canada ",,"502.2 Mine and Quarry Equipment - 525.3 Energy Utilization - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices",,,,,Augers - Electroluminescence - Electron injection - Electrons - Energy gap - Heterojunctions - Organic light emitting diodes (OLED) - Voltage scaling,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lu, Zheng-Hong(zhenghong.lu@utoronto.ca) ",10.1103/PhysRevApplied.3.054011,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),23317019,,,,,5,"May 29, 2015",English,Auger electron spectroscopy,,36.0,,,2015,American Physical Society,Physical Review Applied,,Auger-electron-stimulated organic electroluminescence at ultralow voltages below the energy gap,,Electrical energy - Energy differences - HOMO-LUMO energy gap - Operation mechanism - Organic electro luminescence - Organic heterojunctions - Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs) - Turn-on voltages,3,
Polym. Chem.,"We report a type of polymer microgel that undergoes rapid, reversible, and highly sensitive volume phase transitions upon varying ammonia concentrations in milieu. Such an ammonia-responsive microgel is made by tethering of a phenoxazinium, N-(5-(3-azidopropylamino)-9H-benzo[a]-phenoxazin-9-ylidene)-N-methylmethanaminium chloride, to the network chains of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-propargyl acrylate) via a copper(i)-catalyzed azide-alkene cycloaddition.

Linear Algebra Its Appl,"Several schemes for homogeneous networks have been generalized for load balancing (LB) on heterogeneous networks. However, LB parameters must be recalculated with the change of weight distribution among network nodes in known schemes and this increases the computational complexity and weakens numerical stability on the base of original schemes in which LB parameters are only decided by communication topology. The known load balancing strategies are redesigned to contain a diffusion matrix M∗ with parameters independent of network heterogeneity. In the proposed strategies, LB parameters are only decided by network topology which is identical with the situation of homogeneous network. This leads to lower overhead of computing LB parameters and fewer LB steps than in the known schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes have little variation in the number of LB steps to distinct load distributions, so that they have an enhanced numerical stability. Theoretical and experimental results verify these improvements. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

For. Ecol. Manage.,"Fire plays a major role in fire-dependent ecosystems in shaping plant traits, community assemblage, and in maintaining biodiversity and sustaining ecosystems. Excluding fire from fire-dependent ecosystems can substantially alter these ecosystems. This study mainly investigates the how the zonal vegetation evergreen broad-leaved forests as well as widely distributed vegetation Pinus yunnanensis forest and shrubland in the Central Yunnan Plateau adapt to fire, and addresses the role of fire in the Central Yunnan Plateau ecosystem to determine whether this ecosystem is fire-dependent. Re-sprouting trees and shrubs composed about 90.6% of the dominant taxa. In re-sprouting species, 41 species (77.4% of all re-sprouting species) were observed re-sprout from underground basal burls after a fire. After a fire, 100% of all trees and tall shrubs, 93.6% of all shrubs and 73.9% of all herbs recovered. Two serotinous tree taxa were found, including two varieties of P. yunnanensis (var. pygmaea and var. yunnanensis) which is a dominant and the most common tree species in this region. All these were identified here as weakly serotinous species. The degree of serotiny was 50.4% for P. yunnanensis var. yunnanensis and 74.7% for var. pygmaea. Heat shock resulted in higher seed germination rates for both varieties of P. yunnanensis. Dominant and common taxa in these two typical forest types had typical traits of species known to be adapted to fire; forest fire did not significantly reduce number of species. Based on the above results, the Central Yunnan Plateau ecosystem is a fire-dependent system. Wildfire plays an important role in the community assembly for the semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forests, P. yunnanensis forest and shrub communities. Wildfire should not be viewed as a totally catastrophic event in forests of the Central Yunnan Plateau. In theory this region appropriates to carry out prescribed burning. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20181304945027,,"Su, Wen-Hua (1); Shi, Zhan (1); Zhou, Rui (1); Zhao, Yuan-Jiao (1); Zhang, Guang-Fei (1) ","(1) Institute of Ecology and Geobotany, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",FECMDW,454 Environmental Engineering - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 911.5 Value Engineering - 914.2 Fires and Fire Protection,,,,,Biodiversity - Deforestation - Ecosystems - Fire hazards - Reforestation - Seed - Value engineering - Vegetation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Su, Wen-Hua(whsu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.foreco.2015.05.015,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 31160092, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The National Natural Science Foundation ( 31160092 ) supported this research.

Rock Soil Mech,"Yele Dam is a rockfill dam with an asphaltic concrete core wall. The maximum dam height is 124.5 m. The geological conditions are quite complex and have high seismic intensity. The foundation along the river is seriously asymmetry. The earthquake monitoring station has nine strong motion seismographs on Yele dam. They obtain seismic response records during Wenchuan earthquake and Panzhihua earthquake in 2008. A M7.0 earthquake occurred in Lushan county, Ya'an city, Sichuan province on April 20, 2013. Yele dam was shocked relatively strongly at a distance of 212.5 km away from the epicenter and the earthquake monitoring station obtained the relatively complete and effective records. Based on monitoring data, the time domain analysis and spectrum analysis of the main shock are discussed. Regularities of the dynamic response of Yele dam during the earthquake are summarized. The dynamic responses of Yele dam during Lushan earthquake and Wenchuan earthquake are compared. The results show that the maximum acceleration record due to Lushan earthquake on Yele dam is 47.043 cm/s2, the longest duration is 76.98 s, and the amplification effect at dam crest is obvious. Seismic wave spectral characteristics and vibration characteristics have greater impact on the differences of dam dynamic response during Lushan earthquake and Wenchuan earthquake. Overall, it is concluded that Yele dam remains in normal working state and Lushan earthquake doesn't cause significant adverse effects on the dam. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

Math. Probl. Eng.,"The issue of finite-time H∞ filtering for singular stochastic Markovian jump systems with time-varying delays is concerned in this paper. H∞ filtering is designed for underlying closed-loop singular Markovian jump system and system state does not exceed a given bound over some finite-time interval. Considering the full information of underlying Markov process, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee that the described system is finite-time stability and H∞ filtering finite-time boundedness. By establishing the results of stochastic character and finite-time boundedness, the closed-loop singular Markovian jump system trajectory stays within the given bound.

J Mater Sci Mater Electron,"A facile method was applied to prepare NiO nanoparticles/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanocomposite. The structure and morphology of the as-prepared nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM. It was indicated that NiO nanoparticles with size of 10–30 nm were tightly decorated on the MWCNTs. A chemoresistive gas sensor using NiO nanoparticles/MWCNTs nanocomposite as sensitive material was fabricated on an alumina tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. The gas-sensing properties of NiO nanoparticles/MWCNTs nanocomposite were evaluated for volatile organic compound vapors (VOCs). The electrical resistance is found to be dramatically decreased by three orders of magnitude compared to a sensor based on NiO nanoparticles free MWCNTs. The highest response values of the nanocomposite were obtained at operating temperature of 180 °C. NiO/MWCNTs sensor shows much better performance compared to the NiO sensor and the VOCs responses are found to be several times higher than that of a NiO nanoparticles sensor. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20152901035966,,"Chen, Nan (1); Li, Qing (1); Li, Yuxiu (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 2); Wang, Yude (1, 2) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 819.4 Fiber Products - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Chemical detection - Gas detectors - Gas sensing electrodes - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN) - Nanocomposites - Nanoparticles - Scanning electron microscopy - Synthesis (chemical) - Transmission electron microscopy - Volatile organic compounds - X ray diffraction - Yarn,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s10854-015-3487-0,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1573482X,,,,09574522,10,"October 22, 2015",English,Nickel oxide,,38.0,8240-8248,,2015,Springer New York LLC,Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,,Facile synthesis and gas sensing performances based on nickel oxide nanoparticles/multi-wall carbon nanotube composite,,Carbon-nanotube composites - Chemo-resistive gas sensors - Electrical resistances - Gas sensing properties - Nickel oxide nanoparticle - Operating temperature - Structure and morphology - Three orders of magnitude,26,
Lect. Notes Electr. Eng.,"With China’s rapid economic development in recent years, the scale of foreign direct investment has been expanding.In the meantime, environmental issues have been receiving increasing attention, since the concept of a low carbon economy is prevalent in the world. Secondary Industry is the major energy consumers and the emitted carbon dioxide has a significant negative influence on the environment.This paper discusses the background of low carbon economy and conducts an empirical study of the carbon dioxide emission effect of foreign direct investment in the Secondary Industryin Shandong Province.

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"Both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) can play important roles in ammonia biotransformation in ecosystems. However, the factors regulating the distribution of these microorganisms in lacustrine ecosystems remain essentially unclear. The present study investigated the effects of geographic location on the distribution of sediment AOA and AOB in 13 freshwater lakes on the Yunnan Plateau (China). The spatial dissimilarity in the abundance and structure of sediment AOA and AOB communities was observed in these plateau lakes. AOA abundance was usually less than AOB abundance, and the AOA/AOB ratio was positively correlated with water depth. Nitrososphaera-like AOA occurred in most of the studied lakes and were dominant in two lakes. Nitrosospira was the dominant AOB species in most of the lakes, while Nitrosomonas showed high abundance only in three lakes. In addition, geographic location was found to affect lake sediment AOB community structure. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20150700510967,,"Liu, Yong (1); Zhang, Jingxu (2); Zhao, Lei (3); Li, Yuzhao (1); Dai, Yu (2); Xie, Shuguang (2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (Ministry of Education), College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China ",AMBIDG,454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Ammonia - Ecosystems - Lakes - Location - Sediments - Water,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xie, Shuguang(xiesg@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s00253-014-6341-z,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320614,,,,01757598,10,"May 1, 2015",English,Bacteria,,38.0,4435-4444,,2015,Springer Verlag,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,,Distribution of sediment ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in plateau freshwater lakes,,Ammonia oxidizing bacteria - Ammonia-oxidizing archaea - Community structures - Fresh water lakes - Geographic location - Lacustrine ecosystems - Lake sediments - Nitrosomonas,99,
Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"This paper presents a novel approach for combining and blending a set of aligned images into a composite mosaic with no visible seams and minimal texture distortion. To accelerate execution speed in building high resolution mosaics, the compositing seam is found efficiently via seeded region growing using a photometric criterion. A contribution of this paper is to use seeded region growing on image differences to find possible seams over areas of low photometric difference. This can result in significant reduction of blending time. The proposed method presents several advantages. The using of seeded region growing over image pairs guarantees the approximate optimal solution for each intersection region. The independence of such regions makes the algorithm suitable for parallel implementation. The using of priority queue leads to reduced memory requirements and a compact storage of the input data. Finally, it allows the efficient creation of large mosaics, without user intervention. We also evaluate the proposed blending method with pixel based graph cut and watershed based graph cut to illustrate the performance of the approach on image sequences with qualitative and quantitative comparison. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,,20154601552659,,"Zhao, Yili (1, 2); Xu, Dan (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) School of Computer and Information, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650224, China ",,"722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements",154179.0,"June 19, 2015 - June 20, 2015","Beijing, China","10th Conference on Image and Graphics Technologies and Applications, IGTA 2015",Digital storage - Graphic methods - Photometry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Yili(ylzhao@vip.sina.com) ",10.1007/978-3-662-47791-5_45,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783662477908.0,18650929,,2015,English,Image segmentation,,10.0,408-415,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,Fast image blending using seeded region growing,,Graph cut - Image blending - Image mosaic - Seeded region growing - Watershed segmentation,525,
Earth Sci. Front.,"Geza arc is an important geological tectonic unit which formed in the Paleotethyan stage of the “Sanjiang” area in northwestern Yunnan. It is located in the southern tip of Yidun island-arc in the western margin of the Yangtze craton. In recent years, a series of deposits were newly found there, including the Pulang super-large sized copper deposit, Hongshan-Hongniu large sized copper deposit, Xuejiping large sized copper deposit, and more than 10 small and medium sized porphyry-skarn copper deposits, which constituted a porphyry copper orefield and a copper resources exploration and development base. The research found that the formation of ore deposits closely corresponded to the tectonic evolution, and different deposits were formed in different developmental stages. The regional NW-trending main faults corresponding to the tectonic evolution controlled the rock belts distribution, and the secondary faults and fold controlled morphology and occurrence of the rock mass. Porphyry deposit is mainly distributed in the core of the anticline and the emplacement depth of mineralized porphyry is shallow; skarn copper deposit was mainly produced in the core of the syncline and the emplacement depth of the porphyry was relatively deep. Most mineralized porphyries were composite pluton and often had a volcanic rock cover on the top of the composite pluton, which indicated that volcanic magmatic activity had the inherited characteristics. The formation of the Pulang super-large sized porphyry copper deposit was strictly controlled by the intersection of NW trending structure and NEE structure, it formed a “trinity” porphyry mineralization system which included porphyry copper deposit inside rock mass, skarn copper deposit of the contact zone and the large vein copper ore bodies in surrounding rocks, and also include the lead-zinc deposit and epithermal gold (silver) deposit in the outer contact zone. ©, 2015, Chinese Academy of Forestry.

High Temp Mater Processes,"Removal of chlorine (Cl) from the CuCl residue in the process of zinc hydrometallurgy is of great importance to improve the process economics. The current processing methods result in generation of large quantities of polluted discharge necessitating waste treatment systems. The present work attempts to de-chlorinate the CuCl residue through thermal treatment with application of microwave, towards which the effect of the major experimental factors such as roasting temperature, heating duration and particle size of samples on the process has been investigated. And the changes of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the dechlorination reactions are calculated which show that: 1) CuCl can react with H2O and air to produce CuO and HCl(g); 2) CuCl can be oxidized by air into CuO and Cl2would be released. The tail gas chromatography, XRD and SEM-EDS analysis results of samples before and after microwave roasting verified the thermodynamics study results. Thus, the process of dechlorination by microwave roasting technology is feasible, and the tail gas can be mainly HCl(g) and air which can be absorbed with water and produce hydrochloride easily. © 2015, Walter De Gruyter.

Neiranji Xuebao,"On a two-stage supercharger common-rail heavy-duty(HD)diesel engine, the effects of exhaust gas recirculation(EGR) and main-injection timing on combustion and emission characteristics were studied. Results showed that total combustion duration increases as EGR rate is increased(NOxreduces)is from increase of tail heat release(CA 50-90). The increment of combustion duration under middle-low load condition is less than that under heavy load, and middle-high speed and heavy load condition is less than low speed and heavy load condition. There is an optimal CA 50 and combustion duration at different operation conditions, at this timing, thermal efficiency gives its highest value. Using EGR in reducing NOxwill inevitably increase the combustion loss, the CA 50 and combustion duration deviates from the optimal economic region, resulting in lower thermal efficiency. For the same NOx, the retarded main-injection timing is benefit to reduce the soot at low speed and heavy load condition, thus improving the NOx-soot trade-off. Under high speed conditions, delaying main-injection timing leads to higher BSFC. Meanwhile, delaying main-injection timing reduces the impact of intake temperature on the NOx-soot trade-off and NOx-BSFC trade-off. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Internal Combustion Engines.

Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,"Three nonlinear analysis techniques, including cross-recurrence plot, line of synchronization, and cross-wavelet transform, are proposed to estimate the coherent phase vibrations of nonlinear and non-stationary time series. The case study utilizes the monthly averages of sunspot areas during the time interval from May 1874 to August 2014. The following prominent results are found: (1) the phase-leading hemisphere of long-term sunspot areas has changed twice in the past 140 years, indicating that the hemispheric imbalances and apparent phase differences on both hemispheres are a prevalent behavior and are not anomalous; (2) the alternating regularity of hemispheric asynchronism exhibits a cyclical pattern of 4.5+3.5 cycles, and the magnetic flux excess in a certain hemisphere during the ascending branch of a cycle can be taken as an indication of the phase-leading hemisphere in this cycle.

Water Environ. Res.,"A photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (m-PMFC) is developed for generating electricity by harnessing solar energy using Microcystis aeruginosa. In this m-PMFC, commensal bacteria can consume the nutrients that Microcystis aeruginosa produces to generate electricity so that no net CO2production occurs. A b-MFC is constructed to confirm the role of commensal bacteria in electric generation. An s-PMFC is constructed to confirm the contribution of Microcystis aeruginosa as substrates. The power outputs of m-PMFCs exhibit no significant difference in terms of different inoculation amount of Microcystis aeruginosa or light/dark cycles. The power density of m-PMFC exhibits similar response to bubbling of N2and O2as that of b-MFC, as confirmed by cyclic voltammetry analysis of m-PMFC and b-MFC. Scanning electron microscope images demonstrate that the biofilm of m-PMFC consists mainly of commensal bacteria.

SCI. CHINA Phys. Mech. Astron.,"The ultraviolet broad absorption lines have been seen in the spectra of quasars at high redshift, and are generally considered to be caused by outflows with velocities from thousands kilometers per second to one tenth of the speed of light. They provide crucial implications for the cosmological structures and physical evolutions related to the feedback of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Recently, through a dedicated program of optically spectroscopic identifications of selected quasar candidates at redshift 5 by using the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope, we discovered two luminous broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) at redshift about 4.75. One of them may even have the potentially highest absorption Balnicity Index (BI) ever found to date, which is remarkably characterized by its deep, broad absorption lines and sub-relativistic outflows. Further physical properties, including the metal abundances, variabilities, evolutions of the supermassive black holes (SMBH) and accretion disks associated with the feedback process, can be investigated with multi-wavelength follow-up observations in the future. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20153201154025,,"Yi, WeiMin (1, 2, 3); Wu, XueBing (4, 5); Wang, FeiGe (4); Yang, JinYi (4); Yang, Qian (4); Bai, JinMing (1, 3) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China (2) University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (3) Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China (4) Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (5) Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China ",,"657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 931.5 Gravitation, Relativity and String Theory",,,,,Cosmology - Galaxies - Relativity - Telescopes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, XueBing(wuxb@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11433-015-5685-4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18691927,,,,16747348,9,"September 8, 2015",English,Absorption spectroscopy,,26.0,,,2015,Science in China Press,"Science China: Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy",,Discovery of two broad absorption line quasars at redshift about 4.75 using the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope,,active galactic nuclear (AGN) - Active galactic nuclei - Broad absorption lines - Cosmological structures - High-redshift - outflow - Spectroscopic identification - Supermassive black holes,58,
ICIC Express Lett Part B Appl.,"With the quick development of new-generation scientific instruments, the storage of an unprecedented amount of scientific data (e.g., more than 14 exabytes per day in the SKA project) is becoming a critical problem. The amount of scientific data is growing at an exponential rate and doubling approximately every year. Traditional data storage techniques such as DAS, NAS and SAN, are impossible to fully meet the data access requirements because of the low access performance, limited scalability and weak availability. After the development for tens of years, distributed storage technology is re-garded as the most appropriate technology for massive scientific data storage and archive. In order to further promote the advancements of the distributed storage technology, in this paper, we make a deep investigation on the distributed file system (DFS). We discuss the general architecture of the DFS and describe the implementation of current four mainstream distributed file systems respectively in detail. We then compare several im- portant features of each DFS, and discuss the application situation of each DFS. Finally, we present a series of research directions for future studies of scientific data storage.

Resour. Policy,"Green Mine has become a common plan of Green Mining in China since 2003. Phosphate mining is noticeably important for agriculture. Despite mining technologies made a great progress, resources depletion and mining produced environmental problems are still very severe in many developing countries. Green Mine construction can be a feasible choice to arouse the enthusiasm of Corporation Social Responsibility (CSR) and widely facilitate the Green Mining. Thus, the pith of Green Mine is introduced, which is a critical part of recourses policy for Green Mining. Focusing on demonstration projects, field research and questionnaires are carried out to pick up experts' opinions all over the typical phosphate mining areas. Then as an unprecedented trial, evaluation index system for Green Mine (phosphate) is presented. And it profoundly fosters the basic Green Mine connotation by measuring mining efficiency, Research and Development (R&D), Cleaner Production, corporation management, environment quality and social benefits performance. The proposed evaluation model is characterized by a combination method of Delphi, AHP and Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. On this basis, special evaluation case studies are subsequently available and findings reflect a common performance of both open-pit and underground mines. However, Green Mine policy is a difficult choice for the Chinese government and mining industry. And a stronger need for interdisciplinary cooperation is necessary to bring the Green Mine a bright future. Further research may be the application of other hybrid approaches with the fuzzy analysis of the Green Mine. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,,20153901308368,,"Shang, Delei (1, 2); Yin, Guangzhi (1, 2); Li, Xiaoshuang (3, 4); Li, Yaoji (3, 4); Jiang, Changbao (2); Kang, Xiangtao (5); Liu, Chao (1); Zhang, Chi (1) ","(1) College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400030, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Disaster Dynamics and Control, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400030, China (3) National Engineering Research Center of Phosphate Resources Development and Utilization, Jinning, Yunnan; 650600, China (4) Yunnan Phosphate Chemical Group Co.

Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao,"A novel technique was developed to separate Zn and Cd from high-Cd Zn-concentrate by vacuum distillation. The effect of the distillation conditions, including the pressure, distillation temperature and time, on the separation rates of Zn and Cd was theoretically calculated and experimentally investigated. Theoretically speaking, the novel technique is feasible. The experimental results show that a higher distillation temperature and a longer distillation time considerably increased direct-recovery rate of Cd and decreased Cd-purity in the volatile. For instance, distilled at 30 Pa and 400 for 60 min, the Cd-purity in the volatile was 96.5% with a Cd direct-recovery rate of 60.1%, and the Zn-purity in the residue was 87.42%. The multi-cycle (say, 3 cycles) distillation increased the Cd purity up to over 99.99% in the volatile. We suggest that the newly-developed, environmental friendly, simple technique be of much technological interest in processing the high-Cd Zn-concentrate on industrial scale. ©, 2015, Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao/Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology.

Sep. Purif. Technol.,"The multimetallic sulfide copper ore containing large amounts of lead and iron was roasted in air atmosphere in the presence of calcium oxide, and the calcinate obtained was leached in sulfuric acid solution to extract copper. Characterization of the raw materials, calcinates and leach residues was conducted by using XRD and SEM/EDS analysis. The calcification mechanism of the complex ore was studied. The effects of temperature, stirring speed, liquid/solid ratio and sulfuric acid concentration on the kinetics and mechanism of copper dissolution from the calcinate were also investigated. Results of experiments show that sulfur retention efficiency in the calcinate achieves 97.77%, and that increasing both reaction temperature and acid concentration are capable of resulting in the increase of dissolution rate of copper. Leaching kinetics follows the un-reacted shrinking core model with a rate controlling step by diffusion through the solid product layer and the corresponding apparent activation energy is calculated as 19.21 kJ/mol, and consequently the rate of the dissolution of copper on aspect of H2SO4concentration, liquid/solid ratio, and stirring speed can be expressed as 1+2(1-x)-31-x2/3=6.44×10-4×CA1.72×L/S1.25×ω0.94exp(-2310/T)t. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Jisuanji Fuzhu Sheji Yu Tuxingxue Xuebao,"Since most existing approaches of saliency detection output low-resolution and biologically implausible saliency maps, in this paper, we propose a division normalization method to solve these problems. Our method is biologically motivated and is capable of producing a full resolution saliency map. Firstly, we decompose the input image from L*a*b*color space into five feature channels: green, red, blue, yellow and luminance. Then, we normalize the channels by use of their respective energy. Next, we integrate five normalized channels in the L*a*b*color space. Finally, we employ the Euclidean norm to compute the saliency map. This procedure simulates the same feature suppression in primary visual cortex of humans. Experimental results show that the method is simple and computationally efficient, and outperforms other conventional approaches of saliency detection both on the psychophysical pattern test and on the eye fixations prediction tasks. ©, 2015, Institute of Computing Technology.

Zhongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban),"In view of the inferior liquidity of 3004 aluminum alloy melt in cast-rolling, difficult to distribute in feed tip nozzle and easy to cause defect of sheet, viscosity of 3004 aluminum alloy melt was measured by viscometer for high temperature melt, fluid-thermal field of melt in nozzle cavity was analyzed by finite element simulation analysis software (COMSOL Multiphysics) based on the actual physical parameters and production condition, and nozzle structure was optimized according to the simulation results and it was verified by experiment. The results show that the relationship between viscosity μ and temperature θ from 660 to 750 can be expressed as μ =10-3× exp (0.059+621.379/θ). The vortex emerges in nozzle cavity and fluid-thermal field distributes unevenly at the output of nozzle when the angle is 8° between block and horizontal direction and the gap is 30 mm between block and spacers. While melts flow smoothly and fluid-thermal field is relatively uniform when the block is horizontal and the gap is 50 mm.

RSC Adv.,"In this study, a facile one-step dip-coating approach was reported for superhydrophobic membrane fabrication, in which only epoxy resin and silica nanoparticles were needed. In addition, the surface microstructure and wettability of the membrane were closely related to the content of silica nanoparticles. When the content of silica nanoparticles was 4 wt%, the membrane exhibited optimum surface roughness and superhydrophobicity, by which water was blocked, while oil was allowed to permeate. Through the application of water contact angle, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis and Karl Fischer moisture titrator measurements, the membrane examination indicated that the micro/nanostructures enhanced the water repellency, which was similar to the lotus leaf effect. Furthermore, this method is suitable for large-scale production and employed for micro-water separation in transformer oil. This is possible because environmentally friendly and inexpensive materials are adopted and harsh operations, sophisticated equipment and a special atmosphere are avoided. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,20154601545037,,"Zhou, Liangwei (1); Yu, Ping (1); He, Yunhua (2); Xia, Huanhuan (2); Guo, Xinliang (2); Luo, Yunbai (1) ","(1) College of Chemistry and Molecular Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei; 430072, China (2) Electric Power Research Institute of Yunnan Power Grid Co., Ltd, Kunming; 650217, China ",RSCACL,"704.2 Electric Equipment - 801 Chemistry - 813.2 Coating Materials - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Coatings - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Epoxy resins - Gravimetric analysis - Hydrophobicity - Membranes - Scanning electron microscopy - Silica nanoparticles - Surface roughness - Thermogravimetric analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Ping(yuping@whu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c5ra21016j,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,113,2015,English,Oil filled transformers,,32.0,92947-92953,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,A facile dip-coating approach to stable superhydrophobic SiO2/epoxy resin membrane preparation for micro-water separation in transformer oil liquids,,Large scale productions - Membrane fabrication - Membrane preparation - Micro/nanostructures - Superhydrophobicity - Surface microstructures - Thermal gravimetric analysis - Water contact angle,5,
J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol.,"An electrochemical sensor for podophyllotoxin (PPT) based on the molecular imprinting polymer (MIP) membranes was constructed. The sensor was prepared by electropolymerizing o-phenylenediamine (o-PD) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in the presence of PPT as template, and then removing the template by immersing the modified GCE in ethanol. Experimental parameters such as the types of monomer, scan cycles, concentration of o-PD and extraction condition were optimized. Under optimal conditions, the sensor exhibits a good selectivity and high sensitivity. A good linearity was obtained in the range of 4 × 10-8mol·L-1to 3.2 × 10-5mol·L-1with an estimated detection limit of 4.8 × 10-9mol·L-1.

Anal. Chem.,"A DNAzyme-based ELISA, termed DLISA, was developed as a novel protein enzyme-free, triply amplified platform, combining a catalytic and molecular beacon (CAMB) system with a cation exchange reaction for ultrasensitive multiplex fluorescent immunosorbent assay. Classical ELISA, which employs protein enzymes as biocatalysts to afford amplified signals, suffers from poor stability caused by the irreversible denaturation of these enzymes under harsh conditions, such as heat and acidity. Compared with proteins, nucleic acids are more stable and adaptable, and they can be easily produced using a commercial DNA synthesizer. Moreover, the catalytic and cleavage activities of DNAzyme can be achieved in solution; thus, no enzyme immobilization is needed for detection. Taken together, these attributes suggest that a DNAzyme-based ELISA detection approach will be more robust than current ELISA assays. Importantly, the proposed triply amplified DLISA immunoassay method shows ultrasensitive detection of such targets as human IgG with a detection limit of 2 fg/mL (3 × 10-17M), which is well within the range of many important disease biomarkers. DLISA can also be used to construct a sensing array for simultaneous multiplexed detection. With these merits, this high-throughput, stable, simple, sensitive, and low-cost multiplex fluorescence immunoassay shows promise for applications in clinical diagnosis. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20153201115162,,"Hu, Rong (1, 2, 3); Liu, Tao (1); Zhang, Xiao-Bing (1); Yang, Yunhui (3); Chen, Tao (1, 2); Wu, Cuichen (2); Liu, Yuan (2); Zhu, Guizhi (1); Huan, Shuangyan (1); Fu, Ting (1, 2); Tan, Weihong (1, 2) ","(1) Molecular Science and Biomedicine Laboratory, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha; 410082, China (2) Department of Chemistry, UF Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville; FL; 32611-7200, United States (3) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",ANCHAM,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Assays - Catalyst activity - Diagnosis - Fluorescence - Immunology - Ion exchange - Nucleic acids,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Xiao-Bing(xbzhang@hnu.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acs.analchem.5b01323,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15206882,,,,00032700,15,"August 4, 2015",English,Enzyme immobilization,,38.0,7746-7753,,2015,American Chemical Society,Analytical Chemistry,,DLISA: A DNAzyme-Based ELISA for Protein Enzyme-Free Immunoassay of Multiple Analytes,,Cation exchange reactions - Cleavage activities - Clinical diagnosis - Fluorescence immunoassay - Immunosorbent assays - Irreversible denaturation - Multiplexed detection - Ultrasensitive detection,87,
Key Eng Mat,"The objective of this study was to develop a novel silica modified large-sized hydroxyapatite whiskers with improved properties for use in bone repair applications. Large-sized whiskers with a mean length of 250μm were obtained by a hydrothermal co-precipitation method at 150°C, 7.5Mpa in high-pressure reactor. Silica modified hydroxyapatite whiskers were prepared by dissolving TEOS in ethanol solution, then sintering with hydroxyapatite. The compositional and morphological properties of prepared whiskers were studied by means of x-ray diffraction(XRD), Fouier transform infrared(FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy(SEM). The results indicated the evidence of nano-silicon dioxide particles on the surface of HAP whiskers. The size of nano-silicon dioxide particles depends on dropping and stirring rate.

Bio-Med. Mater. Eng.,"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can be mobilized from bone marrow (BM) into blood stream and home in tumor stroma, where they either help or hinder tumor growth. The issue of whether BMSCs could affect MDSCs in ascitogenous hepatoma BALB/c mice, thus influencing their functional activity, remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that after transfusion into ascitogenous hepatoma BALB/c mice, the homing fraction of BMSCs in BM was 2%-5% in 24-72 h and the percentage of Gr-1+CD11b+MDSCs was downregulated in peripheral blood (PB) and BM. Meanwhile, IFN-γ+T lymphocytes in PB increased. As a result of such immunoregulation, BMSCs treatment caused a delayed tumor growth and a prolonged survival in H22 ascitogenous hepatoma model. Because the proliferation of H22 cells was not affected by in vitro coculture with BMSCs, this observation is likely due to a systemic suppressive effect on the host MDSCs. We also demonstrated that BMSCs inhibited the induction and proliferation of MDSCs from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in an in vitro tumor conditioned medium. Thus, our findings show for the first time that BMSCs are potentially inhibitor during MDSCs induction and proliferation and that when injected intravenously into tumor bearing mice they might be effective antitumor agents suitable for cancer therapy. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.",,,20150100389737,,"Su, Xiaosan (1); Zhang, Lei (1); Ye, Junsong (1); Yang, Liu (1); Li, Yuan (1); Wang, Yiyin (1) ","(1) Biomedical Research Center, First Hospital of Kunming, Affiliated Calmette Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",BMENEO,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering,,,,,Blood - Bone - Cell culture - Mammals - Tumors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Su, Xiaosan ",10.3233/BME-141234,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),18783619,,,,09592989,,2015,English,Stem cells,,31.0,S167-S177,,2015,"IOS Press, Nieuwe Hemweg 6B, Amsterdam, 1013 BG, Netherlands",Bio-Medical Materials and Engineering,,Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells suppress ascitogenous hepatoma progression in BALB/c mouse through reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells,,Anti-tumor agents - Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells - Cancer therapy - Conditioned medium - Functional activities - Hematopoietic stem cells - Immunoregulation - Peripheral blood,25,

There were six treatments: Treatment 1, uncovered tobacco leaves (CK, T1); Treatments 2, 3, 4, 5, tobacco leaves packed by linen cloth (T2), straw mat (T3), white film (T4) and black film (T5); Treatment 6, tobacco leaves sprayed with a mixed enzymatic agent and packed by black film (T6). The results showed that: 1) The moisture content in leaves and the humidity inside bales of T6, T5 and T4 were significantly lower than those of T1, T2 and T3, while the temperature inside bales of T6, T5 and T4 was slightly higher than that of the other three treatments. 2) After treatment for 90 days, the leaf color of T6 turned dark slightly, green faded somewhat, chromaticity enhanced, and appearance quality was improved to a certain extent. 3) Under the catalysis of mixed enzymatic agent, the contents of total sugar, total nitrogen and protein in leaves of T6 reduced slightly, while reduce sugar increased somewhat, and chemical composition tended to be harmonious. 4) After treatment for 90 days, the aroma quality, aroma quantity, offensive odor and aftertaste of leaves of T6 were obviously better than those of T1, T2 and T3; the sensory quality was obviously improved by T6. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of Tobacco Science and Technology.

J. Appl. Remote Sens.,New and effective methods for burned area detection from remote sensing data are required by diverse applications. Burned area detection from a large heterogeneous landscape is a challenging task because of the low-interclass dissimilarity of burned and unburned pixels. Burned and unburned pixels may reflect similar spectral signatures but retain distinct temporal and spatial dependence in its vicinity. This change in temporal and spatial domains can be used to supplement spectral information. The existing methods use only spectral information of the images for detecting burned area and ignore the local temporal and spatial associations. We propose a new method to improve burned area detection accuracy by combining spectral information with local temporal and spatial associations. A method for simultaneous incorporation of these associations by means of cross- and autocorrelation is put forward and tested here under the logistic regression framework. The proposed method was assessed over two different study areas and showed significant increment of 5% to 9% in Kappa accuracy. We demonstrated that the use of cross- and autocorrelation leads to substantial increase in burned area detection accuracy. © 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).,,,20153501213845,15144,"Moughal, Tauqir Ahmed (1); Yu, Fusheng (1); Mazher, Abeer (2); Liu, Shihu (3); Razzaq, Abdul (4) ","(1) Beijing Normal University, Laboratory of Mathematics and Complex Systems, Ministry of Education, Beijing; 100875, China (2) Peking University, Institute of Remote Sensing and GIS, School of Earth and Space Sciences, Beijing; 100871, China (3) Yunnan Minzu University, School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Kunming; 650500, China (4) Beijing Normal University, Institute of Virtual Reality and Visualization Technology, Beijing; 100875, China ",JARSC4,903.3 Information Retrieval and Use - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Autocorrelation - Correlation methods - Information use - Pixels - Regression analysis - Remote sensing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Moughal, Tauqir Ahmed(auqir_mughal@yahoo.com) ",10.1117/1.JRS.9.096018,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19313195,,,,,1,"January 1, 2015",English,Correlation detectors,,23.0,,,2015,SPIE,Journal of Applied Remote Sensing,,Enhanced detection of burned area using cross- and autocorrelation,,Burned areas - Change detection - Diverse applications - Heterogeneous landscapes - Logistic regressions - Remote sensing data - Spectral information - Temporal and spatial,9,
Math. Probl. Eng.,"Based on priority differentiation and efficiency of the system, we consider an N+1 queues' single-server two-level polling system which consists of one key queue and N normal queues. The novel contribution of the present paper is that we consider that the server just polls active queues with customers waiting in the queue. Furthermore, key queue is served with exhaustive service and normal queues are served with 1-limited service in a parallel scheduling. For this model, we derive an expression for the probability generating function of the joint queue length distribution at polling epochs. Based on these results, we derive the explicit closed-form expressions for the mean waiting time. Numerical examples demonstrate that theoretical and simulation results are identical and the new system is efficient both at key queue and normal queues. © 2015 Guan Zheng et al.",,Open Access,20154801620704,109325,"Zheng, Guan (1); Zhijun, Yang (2); Wenhua, Qian (1); Min, He (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Educational and Scientific Institute, Educational Department of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650223, China ",,601.1 Mechanical Devices - 922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Probability distributions - Voting machines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zheng, Guan(gz_627@sina.com) ",10.1155/2015/109325,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15635147,,,,1024123X,,2015,English,Queueing theory,,14.0,,,2015,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,On Two-Level State-Dependent Routing Polling Systems with Mixed Service,,Exhaustive service - Explicit closed form - Mean waiting time - Parallel scheduling - Polling system - Probability generating functions - Queue length distribution - State-dependent,2015,

With an aim of elevating the dosage of S2-/Sx2-redox couples and therefore charge-transfer ability, both osmotic press across the PAAm-G and capillary force within the three-dimensional micropores are utilized as driving forces. A promising power conversion efficiency of 2.34% is recorded for the QDSCs by optimizing graphene dosage in the conducting gel electrolyte. The enhanced conversion efficiency of solar cell is attributed to the expanded catalytic area from counter electrolyte/electrolyte interface to both interface and the conducting gel electrolyte. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20151100643240,,"Duan, Jialong (1, 2); Tang, Qunwei (1, 2); Li, Ru (1); He, Benlin (2); Yu, Liangmin (1, 3); Yang, Peizhi (4) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Marine Chemistry Theory and Technology, Ministry of Education, Ocean University of China, Qingdao; 266100, China (2) Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao; 266100, China (3) Qingdao Collaborative Innovation Center of Marine Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, Qingdao; 266100, China (4) Key Laboratory of Advanced Technique and Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650092, China ",JPSODZ,525.5 Energy Conversion Issues - 702.3 Solar Cells - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 913.1 Production Engineering - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics,,,,,Charge transfer - Conversion efficiency - Efficiency - Graphene - Hydrogels - Nanocrystals - Polyacrylates - Semiconductor quantum dots - Solar cells - Solid electrolytes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Qunwei(tangqunwei@ouc.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.060,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: ZR2011BQ017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Number: 2010AA065104, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2010AA09Z203, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012BAB15B02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 201312005, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 201313001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 13-4-198-jch, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1037604, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: BS2013CL015, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge financial supports from Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 201313001 , 201312005 ), Shandong Province Outstanding Youth Scientist Foundation Plan ( BS2013CL015 ), Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation ( ZR2011BQ017 ), Research Project for the Application Foundation in Qingdao (13-4-198-jch), National Key Technology Support Program ( 2012BAB15B02 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( U1037604 ), and National High-Tech Research and Development Programme of China ( 2010AA09Z203 , 2010AA065104 ).

Int. J. Green Energy,"Biomass briquettes compressed from waste tobacco stalk have been tested for their potential fuel substitution of coal for the bulk curing operation. Parallel experiments were conducted in industrial scale bulk curing barns at six locations in Yunnan province of China using coal and biomass briquettes as fuels. The results showed that biomass briquettes performed equally as coal but superior at the high temperature curing stages because of their higher burning rate than coal. The energy efficiency for burning biomass briquettes ranged from 39 to 42%, higher than 36% from burning coal in parallel tests. The substitution of coal by the waste tobacco stalk briquettes, in conjunction with improvement in barn energy efficiency, offers the greatest potential for the Chinese tobacco industry to meet the Chinese national greenhouse gas emission intensity target of being 40-45% below its 2005 emissions level by 2020.

Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"To study the uncertainty of power system transient stability with grid-connected wind power in the process of power grid planning, Kriging surrogate model was proposed in this paper. The random and correlative wind speed predicted by the third order polynomial normal transformation method based on probability weighted moments was regarded as stochastic input. For each input, transient time-domain simulation was performed to obtain the stochastic response. Kriging surrogate model could be established to display the implicit function between stochastic input and response. Compared with Monte Carlo method, Kriging surrogate model can get the response statistics more quickly when the calculation times are the same. The case studying on IEEE 39-bus system verifies the effectiveness, accuracy and efficiency of the method adopted. The case studying on Yunnan power grid system verifies the practicability of the method to the actual system. Meanwhile it shows that the random wind speed can cause uncertainty of the system response and have certain influence on safe and stable operation of the power system. © 2015 Chin. Soc. for Elec.

Nongye Jixie Xuebao,"The helical intake port geometry directly controls swirl ratio, volumetric efficiency and combustion characteristics as well as emissions reduction of diesel engine. A new digital design method of helical intake port was studied. In this method, cylinder head structure was considered as a constraint condition, and the swirl ratio was considered as the design target; then the flow coefficient was optimized. The effect of the geometry structure and port sensitive areas of diesel engine helical intake port on the intake port flow characteristics was analyzed, and several key structural parameters of helical intake port were defined. As a result, a parameterized mathematical model of helical intake port was established. Based on parameterized mathematical model of helical intake port and several key structural parameters of helical intake port, a digital modeling software about diesel engine helical intake port was developed. For the design requirements of helical intake port of self-developed horizontal two-cylinder diesel engine, a digital 3D model of helical intake port was established by using the helical intake port digital modeling software, and model smoothness and flow characteristics of this 3D model were analyzed. The results show that helical intake port digital design method has a certain feasibility and versatility.

Int. J. Signal Process. Image Process. Pattern Recogn.,"The traditional detection methods are easily affected by noise. It is difficult to extract the useful signal from the power traveling wave which is submerged in a lot of noise. A method using digital lock-in amplifier is proposed for detecting the power traveling wave signal. The basic principles of the lock-in amplifier are studied. Virtual instrument language LabVIEW is used to design the digital lock-in amplifier. It is able to extract the corresponding frequency components of the power traveling wave signal. As the front panel and the flow sheet of the digital lock-in amplifier are presented, the design of each module is introduced in detail. The experimental research on detecting signals containing noise and not containing noise are carried out, respectively. The results of experiment show that the presented digital lock-in amplifier can accurately extract the corresponding frequency components of the power traveling wave signal. Moreover, with the increase of the noise amplitude, the root mean square error of the output signals varies little. The presented digital lock-in amplifier is able to cancel the effect of noise. Therefore, it is a powerful tool to detect and extract the power traveling wave signal. © 2015 SERSC.",,,20151900827049,,"Ye, Bo (1); Chen, Fei (1); Li, Ming (1) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Smart Grid, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan Province, China ",,"601.3 Mechanisms - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 731.1 Control Systems - 941 Acoustical and Optical Measuring Instruments - 942 Electric and Electronic Measuring Instruments - 943 Mechanical and Miscellaneous Measuring Instruments - 944 Moisture, Pressure and Temperature, and Radiation Measuring Instruments",,,,,Digital instruments - Locks (fasteners) - Mean square error - Signal processing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ye, Bo ",10.14257/ijsip.2015.8.4.31,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,20054254,4,2015,English,Signal detection,,17.0,361-374,,2015,Science and Engineering Research Support Society,"International Journal of Signal Processing, Image Processing and Pattern Recognition",,The digital lock-in amplifier for detecting the power traveling wave signal,,Digital lock-in amplifier - Experimental research - Frequency components - LabViEW - Root mean square errors - Traveling wave - Traveling-wave signals - Virtual instrument,8,

Environ. Earth Sci.,"In order to understand phosphorus (P) cycling and mobility in the sediment of Dianchi Lake, the spatial distribution of P fractions in surface sediment has been investigated through sequential extraction. The relationship of P fractions with the P concentrations in the overlying water, mobile P contents, and organic matters was also analyzed to determine the potential mobility and the retention effect of P in surface sediments from Dianchi Lake. Results showed that (1) the average total amount of P in the surface sediments of Dianchi Lake was 2,050.31 ± 620.27 mg kg−1. The pollution levels in Caohai and in the south of Waihai were significantly higher than those in other parts of the lake. The P fractions were ranked as follows: HCl-P > NaOH-RP > Res-P > BD-P > NaOH-NRP > NH4Cl-P. Among these P fractions, NaOH-RP content (1,285.23 ± 1,110.51 mg kg−1) was highest in Caohai sediments, whereas HCl-P (925.64 ± 513.58 mg kg−1) was dominant in Waihai. (2) The average content of mobile P was 242.31 ± 98.11 mg kg−1in sediments; this value accounted for 13.54 % of total extractable P. Nonetheless, this content decreased from north to south in the lake. The average immobile P content was 1,547.22 ± 593.05 mg kg−1. This value constituted 86.46 % of total extractable P. The trend of immobile P content was the opposite to that of mobile P content. (3) The P content and retention rate (66.93 %) of sediments were generally high. However, this rate was significantly lower in Caohai (13.80 %) than in Waihai (72.61 %). This result indicates that the risk of releasing the P in Caohai sediments is considerably higher than that in Waihai sediments. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20151100640802,,"Li, Lingping (1, 2, 3, 4); Liu, Lei (3); Wang, Shengrui (1, 2, 4); Liu, Wenbin (1, 2, 4); Jiao, Lixin (1, 2, 4); Yang, Yang (5); Yang, Rui (5) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing; 100012, China (2) State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory for Lake Pollution Control, Research Center of Lake Eco-environment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing; 100012, China (3) College of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang; 330031, China (4) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; Yunnan province; 650034, China (5) School of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Yunnan Nationalities University, Kunming; 650031, China ",,483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Chlorine compounds - Phosphorus - Sediments - Sodium hydroxide - Spatial distribution - Surficial sediments,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shengrui(wangshengruia@126.com) ",10.1007/s12665-015-4151-y,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18666299,,,,18666280,5,"October 1, 2015",English,Lakes,,43.0,3721-3731,,2015,Springer Verlag,Environmental Earth Sciences,,Spatial distribution of phosphorus fractions in sediment and the potential mobility of phosphorus in Dianchi Lake,,Overlying water - Phosphorus fractions - Pollution level - Potential mobility - Potentially mobile ability - Retention rate - Sequential extraction - Surface sediments,74,

Huanan Ligong Daxue Xuebao,"An experiment on three 1:2 scaled reinforced concrete-brick composite walls with opening was conducted to evaluate the seismic performance of severely-damaged low-strength composite walls strengthened by fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). By a pre-damage experiment simulating earthquake and the low-cycle reversed loading experiments with no strengthening, strengthening by using fibers and rehabilitating the specimen after pre-damage, the specimens were compared in terms of experimental phenomena, cracking load, ultimate bearing load and displacement, hysteretic curves, energy dissipation capacity, bearing capacity, stiffness degradation, deformation recovery capacity and FRP strain. The results show that (1) FRP-strengthened walls exhibit the shear-flexural failure mode, which is superior to the shear-dominant failure mode of the specimen without strengthening; (2) FRP strengthening can improve the seismic performance of the composite walls significantly, but not for the initial cracking load; and (3) the seismic performance of the damaged composite masonry walls strengthened with BFRP can recover or even exceed that of the specimen without strengthening. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology.

Soil Tillage Res.,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in soil biological activity and transport of pollutants and nutrients in soils, but very little information is available with regard to the long-term impact of agricultural management practices on the dynamics and fate of DOM in acidic soils. The seasonal and inter-annual variation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) contents and leaching were investigated in an acidic clay soil (Ferric Acrisol) by a long-term field lysimeter experiment in subtropical China. The experiment was conducted from 2002 to 2010 with 4 fertilization treatments under maize monoculture: no manure (CK), low-rate manure with 150kgNha-1y-1(LM), high-rate manure with 600kgNha-1y-1(HM), and high-rate manure with 600kgNha-1y-1and lime at 3000kg Ca(OH)2ha-13y-1(HML). Manure application resulted in a seasonal variation of soil DOC and DON, and significant effects were observed by manure DOC, microbial biomass and soil water content. Soil DOC, which was mainly determined by soil organic matter and soil water content, increased yearly until the seventh year when it was stabilized. Manure application on acidic clay soil did not alter DOC leaching, whereas DON leaching clearly increased after three years of high manure application of 600kgNha-1y-1. The average annual DON leaching losses under long-term manure application had a range of 3.8-5.4kgha-1, accounting for 6-11% of total nitrogen leached. The addition of lime, combined with manure application, produced no impact on soil dynamics and leaching of DOC and DON, with the exception of increasing emission of CO2. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20144700233131,,"Long, Guang-Qiang (1, 2); Jiang, Yu-Ji (1); Sun, Bo (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 71 East Beijing Road, Nanjing; 210008, China (2) College of Resources and Environment, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China ",SOTRD5,407.2 Waterways - 443 Meteorology - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 481.2 Geochemistry - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821.5 Agricultural Wastes,,,,,Bioactivity - Biogeochemistry - Biological materials - Clay - Dissolution - Fertilizers - Leaching - Lime - Manures - Nitrogen - Organic carbon - Soil mechanics - Soil moisture - Stream flow - Tropics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Sun, Bo ",10.1016/j.still.2014.09.020,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: XDB15030200, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2014CB441003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41201240, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41201289, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Hongtao Hao and Xiuli Wang for their works to run the experiment during 2002–2007.

Indian J. Eng. Mater. Sci.,"The effects of stacking fault energy (SFE) on the deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of Cu, Cu-2.5 at.% Al-2.5 at.% Zn, and Cu-12.1 at.% Al-4.1 at.% Zn alloys processed by different rolling temperatures have been systematically investigated. Tensile tests at room temperature indicate that, as SFE decreased, strength and ductility increased, and at constant SFE the samples deformed via rolling at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) exhibit higher strength and better ductility than those deformed via rolling at room temperature (293 K). With lowering SFE, the crystallite size decreases while the microstrain, dislocations and twin densities increase. With decreasing temperature, there is a transition of deformation mechanism from that dominate by dislocation activities to that dominate by deformation twinning. The results indicate that decreasing SFE is an optimum method for improving the ductility of Cu and Cu alloys without loss of strength, and that temperature plays a key role in the rolling process. © 2015 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Neiranji Xuebao,"AVL BOOST was used to build one-dimensional simulation model of D19 high pressure common rail diesel engine. The effects of various exhaust gas recirculation(EGR)ratios on engine performance and emissions were studied. Both initial and boundary conditions for chemical kinetics calculation were given. The heating and chemical effects of CO2and H2O of high EGR ratio(56%)on n-heptane combustion process and key intermediate as well as final products were analyzed. Calculation results show that CO2of EGR lowers the peak of C2H2 and CO production, and weakens the oxidation ability, leading to the slight increase of the final value of C2H2, double of CO, and decrease of NO by 81%,. At high temperature, the chemical effect of CO2has little effect on these species and slightly promote the generation of CO and NO. The effect of H2O on generation of C2H2 is more obvious than CO2. CO shows the opposite, the final volume fraction of CO is half to that of pure air intake, and inhibition on generation of NO is weaker than CO2, decreased by 59%,, which is the result of heating and chemical effects. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Internal Combustion Engines.

IET Conf Publ,"Automatic ship detection from SAR remote sensing imagery is very important, with a wide array of applications in areas such as national marine safety, vessel traffic services, and naval warfare. However, SAR remote sensing images with the high inhomogeneity of sea clutter and complex scene result in a large number of false alarms. This paper focuses on the problem of false alarm removal and coverts it as a classification problem with respect to ship targets and false alarms. However, in real application: 1) Compared to false alarms the number of ships is much smaller, and 2) false alarms with diverse categories and no uniform characteristics are difficult to be distinguished from ships. To solve the problems above, we present a new method based on one-class SVM (OC-SVM) combined with grid optimization that only use the data of ships to train classifier in the absence of false alarms. First, 2P-CFAR is adopted to extract ship candidates and 14 features mainly focusing on ship targets are selected. Second, grid optimization is exploited to obtain parameters for OC-SVM training, where it is a compromise between the probability of false alarm and detection rate. Experimental results of OC-SVM on a large SAR image set demonstrate that in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods like SVM, BP neural network, our approach can achieve higher detection accuracy.",,,20162402497463,,"Yang, Xiaoting (1); Bi, Fukun (2); Yu, Ying (3); Chen, Liang (1) ","(1) Beijing Key Laboratory of Embedded Real-Time Information Processing Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing; 100081, China (2) School of Electronic Information Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing; 100144, China (3) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"434.1 Waterway Transportation, General - 672 Naval Vessels - 672.1 Combat Naval Vessels - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment",121050.0,"October 14, 2015 - October 16, 2015","Hangzhou, China",IET International Radar Conference 2015,Errors - Marine applications - Marine safety - Naval vessels - Naval warfare - Neural networks - Problem solving - Radar imaging - Remote sensing - Synthetic aperture radar - Tracking radar - Waterway transportation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Liang(chenl@bit.edu.cn) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61171194, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61263048, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 91438203, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The work described in this paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61263048, No.61171194 and No.91438203), General project of science and technology program of Beijing Education Commission, and Scientific pre-research foundation of North China University of Technology.",,,CP677,2015,English,Alarm systems,,10.0,,1of1,2015,Institution of Engineering and Technology,IET Conference Publications,,An effective false-alarm removal method based on OC-SVM for SAR ship detection,,False alarms - OC-SVM - Parameters analysis - Performance comparison - Ship detection,2015,
Wuli Xuebao,"This paper studies the equivalent refractive index method and other methods to measure the liquid diffusion coefficient. Based on this, a quick method to measure the liquid diffusion coefficient is proposed, i.e. using a specially designed asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens as both diffusive pool and imaging element. By means of this system with the liquid-core cylindrical lens to measure the diffusion coefficient, we can eliminate the spherical aberration and improve the accuracy in refractive index measurement. Based on the spatially resolving ability of the cylindrical lens in measuring the refractive index, only one instantaneous diffusive picture is required. Depending on the correspondence between the image width and the refractive index, we thus can quickly calculate the diffusion coefficient D by the Fick's second law. Then the diffusive process of ethylene glycol in water at 25 is investigated by this method. We calculate the diffusion coefficient between 660-3000 s with the method to analyse an instantaneous diffusion picture. At the beginning, injection will cause the liquid turbulent, and thus create a larger diffusion coefficient. In the course of diffusion, the influence of turbulence on the diffusion coefficient gradually decreases, but the image narrowing can make inaccurate results. Therefore, this method is required to be used at an appropriate time and an appropriate position to reduce experimental errors. After repeated experiments we can conclude that, between 1500-2700 s we may select the appropriate measurement of location for measuring liquid diffusion coefficient by the method to analyze an instantaneous diffusive picture.

Comput. Sci. Applic. Proc. Asia Pac. Comput. Sci. Applic. Conf.,"Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) is always an essential research focus as it is of great use in many fields. Though more and more data with high resolution can be used in LULC classification as time goes by, the remote sensing data is always useful because it contains a lot of information and can offer an overview of the study area. Thus, it is still important to find good methods to use the remote sensing data in the LULC classification. In this paper, the Back Propagation (BP) neural network improved by the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is used as an approach and the result turns out to be good. This method can effectively classify the surface features into different categories. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20154201380809,,"Cao, Qiongshan (1); Guo, Zhongyang (1); Yang, Yong (2) ","(1) East China Normal University, Shanghai, China (2) Yunnan Province Mapping Institute, Yunnan, China ",,403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence,122869.0,"December 27, 2014 - December 28, 2014","Shanghai, China","Proceedings of the Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Applications, CSAC 2014",Backpropagation algorithms - Land use - Neural networks - Remote sensing - Simulated annealing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781138028111.0,,,2015,English,Classification (of information),"Computer Science and Applications - Proceedings of the Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Applications, CSAC 2014",16.0,369-373,1 of 1,2015,CRC Press/Balkema,"Computer Science and Applications - Proceedings of the Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Applications, CSAC 2014",,An improved back propagation neural network approach to the remote sensing land use and land cover classification,,Back propagation neural networks - High resolution - Improved back propagation neural network - Land use and land cover - Land-use and land cover classifications - Remote sensing data - Simulated annealing algorithms - Surface feature,,
Astron. Astrophys.,"Aims. Astrometric observations performed by the Gaia Follow-Up Network for Solar System Objects (Gaia-FUN-SSO) play a key role in ensuring that moving objects first detected by ESA's Gaia mission remain recoverable after their discovery. An observation campaign on the potentially hazardous asteroid (99 942) Apophis was conducted during the asteroid's latest period of visibility, from 12/21/2012 to 5/2/2013, to test the coordination and evaluate the overall performance of the Gaia-FUN-SSO. Methods. The 2732 high quality astrometric observations acquired during the Gaia-FUN-SSO campaign were reduced with the Platform for Reduction of Astronomical Images Automatically (PRAIA), using the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalogue 4 (UCAC4) as a reference. The astrometric reduction process and the precision of the newly obtained measurements are discussed. We compare the residuals of astrometric observations that we obtained using this reduction process to data sets that were individually reduced by observers and accepted by the Minor Planet Center. Results. We obtained 2103 previously unpublished astrometric positions and provide these to the scientific community. Using these data we show that our reduction of this astrometric campaign with a reliable stellar catalog substantially improves the quality of the astrometric results. We present evidence that the new data will help to reduce the orbit uncertainty of Apophis during its close approach in 2029. We show that uncertainties due to geolocations of observing stations, as well as rounding of astrometric data can introduce an unnecessary degradation in the quality of the resulting astrometric positions. Finally, we discuss the impact of our campaign reduction on the recovery process of newly discovered asteroids. © 2015 ESO.",,Open Access,20154601537186,A59,"Thuillot, W. (1); Bancelin, D.

Hongwai yu Jiguang Gongcheng Infrared Laser Eng.,"Because of the existence of space debris, the space environment is getting worse, and the space activities safety is affected by space debris. Many countries have developed detection technique for space debris, and the space debris laser ranging is a new technology. Firstly, the development and the status of space debris in the domestic and overseas were summarized in this paper. Secondly, space debris laser ranging echo was received successfully at Yunnan Observatories and the method of orbit determination with laser ranging date and angle date at single station was researched. The results of simulation calculation show that the precision of orbit determination by this method is better than that of by optical angle measurement. Finally, a method of space debris scale preliminary determination using the space debris laser ranging error was provided, and the feasibility of this method was verified by the experiments of ground target laser ranging and space debris laser ranging respectively, and this method is useful for further development of space debris scale determination. © 2015, Editorial Board of Journal of Infrared and Laser Engineering.

Water Res.,"Electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) is a novel electrocatalytic ozonation process that combines ozonation and electrolysis process to enhance pollutant degradation during water and wastewater treatment. This enhancement has been mainly attributed to several mechanisms that increase O3transformation to OH in the E-peroxone system, e.g., electro-generation of H2O2from O2at a carbon-based cathode and its subsequent peroxone reaction with O3to OH, electro-reduction of O3to OH at the cathode, and O3decomposition to OH at high local pH near the cathode. To get more insight how these mechanisms contribute respectively to the enhancement, this study investigated total organic carbon (TOC) elimination from oxalic acid (OA) solutions by the E-peroxone process. Results show that the E-peroxone process significantly increased TOC elimination rate by 10.2-12.5 times compared with the linear addition of the individual rates of corresponding ozonation and electrolysis process. Kinetic analyses reveal that the electrochemically-driven peroxone reaction is the most important mechanism for the enhanced TOC elimination rate, while the other mechanisms contribute minor to the enhancement by a factor of 1.6-2.5. The results indicate that proper selection of electrodes that can effectively produce H2O2at the cathode is critical to maximize TOC elimination in the E-peroxone process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,Open Access,20152100862956,,"Wang, Huijiao (1); Yuan, Shi (1); Zhan, Juhong (1, 2); Wang, Yujue (1); Yu, Gang (1); Deng, Shubo (1); Huang, Jun (1); Wang, Bin (1) ","(1) School of Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory for Emerging Organic Contaminants Control, State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Tsinghua University, Beijing; 100084, China (2) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",WATRAG,452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 453 Water Pollution - 522 Gas Fuels - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Cathodes - Electrolysis - Hydrogen peroxide - Hydrogen production - Oxalic acid - Ozone - Ozone water treatment - Ozonization - Wastewater treatment - Water pollution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yujue ",10.1016/j.watres.2015.05.024,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18792448,"Number: 2013AA06A305, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20141081174, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: CICREQ, Sponsor: Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality; ","This research is supported by the National High Technology Research and Development of China (No. 2013AA06A305 ), the special fund of State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control ( 13Y01ESPCT ), Scholarship Award for Excellent Doctoral Student granted by Yunnan Province, Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program ( 20141081174 ), and Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality .

The effect of structural irregularity on lateral shift is evaluated by stationary-phase approach. Our results show that the lateral shift can be modulated by varying the structural irregularity in quasiperiodic structure. Besides, the position of peak in lateral shift spectrum stays sensitive to the chiral factor of chiral materials. In comparison with that of periodic structure, quasiperiodic structure provides an extra degree of freedom to manipulate the lateral shift. © 1899 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20144800248916,,"Da, Jian (1); Mo, Qi (2); Cheng, Yaokun (1); Liu, Taixiang (3) ","(1) Department of Information Engineering, Huaian Senior Vocational and Technical School, Feiyao road, Huaian, Jiangsu Province; 223005, China (2) School of Software, Yunnan University, Cuihu Bai Road, Kunming City, Yunnan Province; 650091, China (3) Taishan Vocational College of Nursing, Shandong Province; 271000, China ",PHYBE3,931.1 Mechanics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Chirality - Degrees of freedom (mechanics),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Da, Jian ",10.1016/j.physb.2014.11.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,09214526,,"February 1, 2015",English,Photonic crystals,,18.0,63-66,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Physica B: Condensed Matter,,Lateral shift in one-dimensional quasiperiodic chiral photonic crystal,,Chiral material - Chiral photonic crystals - Degree of freedom - Lateral shifts - Quasi-periodic - Quasi-periodic photonic crystals - Quasi-periodic structures - Stationary phase approach,458,

We model community detection as a coalition formation game in which individuals in a social network are modelled as rational players aiming to improve the group's utilities by cooperating with other players to form coalitions. Each player is allowed to join multiple coalitions, and those coalitions with fewer players can merge into a larger coalition as long as the merge operation is beneficial to the utilities of the merged coalitions, thus overlapping and hierarchical communities can be revealed simultaneously. The utility function of each coalition is defined as the combination of a gain function and a cost function. The gain function measures the degree of interactions amongst the players inside a coalition, while the cost function instead represents the degree of the interactions between the players of the coalition and the rest of the network. As game theory provides a formal analytical framework with a set of mathematical tools to study the complex interactions among rational players, applying game theory for detecting communities helps to identify communities more rationally. Some desirable properties of the utility function, such as the non-resolution limit and the non-scaling behavior, have been examined theoretically. To solve the issue of pre-setting the number and size for communities and to improve the efficiency of the detection process, we have developed a greedy agglomerative manner to identify communities. Extensive experiments have been conducted on synthetic and real networks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach which can be applied for real world applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"Key revocation and ciphertext update are two prominent security requirements for identity-based encryption systems from a practical view. Several solutions to offer efficient key revocation or ciphertext update for identity-based encryption systems have been proposed in the literature. However, how to achieve both key revocation and ciphertext update functionalities simultaneously in identity-based encryption systems is still an open problem. Recently, Liang et al. introduce the notion of cloud-based revocable identity-based proxy re-encryption (CRIB- PRE) scheme with the aim to achieve both ciphertext update and key revocation functionalities, and present a CR-IB-PRE scheme from bilinear pairings. In this paper, we first showed Liang et al.’s scheme has serious security pitfalls such as re-encryption key forgery and collusion attack, which lead to revoked users can decrypt any ciphertext regarding their identities at any time period. We then redefined the syntax and security model of CR-IB-PRE scheme and proposed an improved CR-IB-PRE scheme from bilinear pairings. The improved scheme not only achieves collusion resistance, but also takes lower decryption computation and achieves constant size re-encrypted ciphtertext. Finally, we proved the improved CR-IB-PRE scheme is adaptively secure in the standard model under DBDH assumption. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,,20160101744681,,"Wang, Changji (1, 2); Fang, Jian (2, 3); Li, Yuan (2, 3) ","(1) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China (3) School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China ",,"722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",156569.0,"November 4, 2014 - November 6, 2014","Beijing, China","6th International Conference on Applications and Techniques in Information Security, ATIS 2015",Cloud computing - Public key cryptography,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Changji(wchangji@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-662-48683-2_2,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783662486825.0,18650929,,2015,English,Network security,"Applications and Techniques in Information Security - 6th International Conference, ATIS 2015, Proceedings",19.0,14-26,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Deakin University, Australia; Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China",An improved cloud-based revocable identity-based proxy re-encryption scheme,,Ciphertexts - Collusion resistance - Identity Based Encryption - Key revocation - Proxy re encryptions - Proxy re-encryption schemes - Security requirements - The standard model,557,
ACS Nano,"Graphane is graphene fully hydrogenated from both sides, forming a 1×1 structure, where all C atoms are in sp3configuration. In silicene, the Si atoms are in a mixed sp2/sp3configuration; it is therefore natural to imagine a silicane structure analogous to graphane. However, a monatomic silicene sheet grown on substrates generally reconstructs into different phases, and only partially hydrogenated silicene with reconstructions had been reported before. In this work, we produce half-silicane, where one Si sublattice is fully H-saturated and the other sublattice is intact, forming a perfect 1×1 structure. By hydrogenating various silicene phases on a Ag(111) substrate, we found that only the (2√×2√)R30° phase can produce half-silicane. Interestingly, this phase was previously considered to be a highly defective or incomplete silicene structure. Our results indicate that the structure of the (2√×2√)R30° phase involves a complete silicene-1×1 lattice instead of defective fragments, and the formation mechanism of half-silicane was discussed with the help of first-principles calculations. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20154901634663,,"Qiu, Jinglan (1); Fu, Huixia (1); Xu, Yang (1, 2); Zhou, Qing (2); Meng, Sheng (1); Li, Hui (1); Chen, Lan (1); Wu, Kehui (1, 3) ","(1) Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100190, China (2) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Beijing, 100871, China ",,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 921 Mathematics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Calculations - Crystal atomic structure - Hydrogenation - Scanning tunneling microscopy - Substrates,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Lan(lchen@iphy.ac.cn) ",10.1021/acsnano.5b04722,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1936086X,,,,19360851,11,"November 24, 2015",English,Silicene,,37.0,11192-11199,,2015,American Chemical Society,ACS Nano,,From Silicene to Half-Silicane by Hydrogenation,,Ag(111) - C atoms - First-principles calculation - Formation mechanism - Graphane - Si atoms - silicane - Sub-lattices,9,
Int. Conf. Commun. Technol. Proc. ICCT,"Spectral clustering employs spectral-graph structure of a similarity matrix to partition data into disjoint meaningful groups, because of its well-defined mathematical framework, good performance and simplicity, spectral clustering has gained considerable attentions in the recent past. Despite these virtues, it suffers from several drawbacks, such as it is unable to determine a reasonable cluster number, sensitive to initial condition and not robust to outliers. In this paper, we present a new approach named density peak spectral clustering (DPSC) which combines spectral clustering with density peak clustering algorithm (DPCA) into a unified framework to solve these problems. Since multi-view data is common in clustering problem, to further bootstrap the clustering performance by using complementary information from different view, then we propose co-Trained density peak spectral clustering (Co-DPSC), which is an extension of DPSC to multi-views based on the co-Training idea. Experimental comparisons with a number of baselines on a toy and three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed DPSC and Co-DPSC algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161502215081,7399974,"Li, Yang (1); Liu, Weifeng (1); Wang, Yanjiang (1); Tao, Dapeng (2) ","(1) College of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao; 266580, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China ",,903.1 Information Sources and Analysis,119327.0,"October 18, 2015 - October 20, 2015","Hangzhou, China","16th IEEE International Conference on Communication Technology, ICCT 2015",,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICCT.2015.7399974,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467370042.0,,,"February 4, 2016",English,Clustering algorithms,"Proceedings of 2015 IEEE 16th International Conference on Communication Technology, ICCT 2015",26.0,925-929,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"International Conference on Communication Technology Proceedings, ICCT",,Co-spectral clustering based density peak,,Clustering problems - Co-training - Density peaks - Experimental comparison - Mathematical frameworks - Multi-views - Real-world datasets - Spectral clustering,2016-February,

Shuili Xuebao,"Small hydropower (SHP) shares a large proportion in the generation mix in hydropower-rich regions. As large and small hydropower crowded to export electricity during flood seasons and the output of SHP fluctuate frequently, it has a serious effect on power grid. This paper introduced a short term optimal operation model for the maximization of large and small combined hydropower consumption. The SHP stations in the same area are considered as a group in the model, using fuzzy clustering analysis method to establish the output scenario of SHP and its probability distribution, which is solved by the combination of heuristic search method and successive associated search method. The application in the small hydropower rich areas shows that this model can effectively use the regulation capacity of large hydropower stations to optimize joint operation and reduce the curtailment of small hydropower.

Gaodianya Jishu,"Transmission equipment panoramic information has the problem of multiple sources and heterogeneous characteristics, which hinders the efficient aggregation and deep data mining. To solve such a problem, we proposed a multi-source heterogeneous data aggregation method based on improved hybrid ontology, constructed local ontology and global ontology, and used the semantic feature of ontology to solve the key problem of semantic heterogeneity in the aggregation process. Moreover, we used the combination of construction of web ontology language and rule of semantic web rule language to establish the ontology mapping to realize reuse and sharing of the mapping. The data aggregation results of transmission equipment condition information and environmental information prove that the method can shield the semantic difference of the physic and logic of the underlying data source, and can achieve the transparent access, effective aggregation and deep data mining to the data sources layer.

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"Abstract The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is one of the most popular criteria for model selection in finite mixture models. However, it implausibly penalizes the complexity of each component using the whole sample size and completely ignores the clustered structure inherent in the data, resulting in over-penalization. To overcome this problem, a novel criterion called hierarchical BIC (HBIC) is proposed which penalizes the component complexity only using its local sample size and matches the clustered data structure well. Theoretically, HBIC is an approximation of the variational Bayesian (VB) lower bound when sample size is large and the widely used BIC is a less accurate approximation. An empirical study is conducted to verify this theoretical result and a series of experiments is performed on simulated and real data sets to compare HBIC and BIC. The results show that HBIC outperforms BIC substantially and BIC suffers from underestimation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Acta Geoscientica Sin.,"The salt formation theory has led to the breakthrough and important progress in potash deposit prospecting: a new type gravel brine layer rich in potassium was discovered in the early pre-Quaternary strata in Altun Mountains in the west of Qaidam Basin. This progress was made by the Salt Party of the Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, headed by Professor ZhengMianping, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, with such institutions as the Qaidam Comprehensive Exploration Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources as the co-researchers and under the joint support of geological survey projects and key projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Drilling shows that it possesses the estimated resource quantity of 350 million tons and hence is likely to be the reserve base of potash salt in Qaidam Basin. Additionally, Paleogene potash-bearing ore beds with the thickness of 100 meters were found in Kuqa depression, Tarim, where there is a 41 meter-thick salt bed of potassium chloride that reaches industrial grade. Furthermore, Triassic polyhalite was found in Sichuan Basin, which is not only an important potassium source in deep brine rich in potash but also a precious slow-release potassium fertilizer. Besides, in Upper Yangtze River Basin, 13 potassium-rich brine deposits of brine-bearing structure were evaluated, and the potassium chloride resource is estimated to be 49.17 million tons. What is more, in Mengyejing of southwestern Yunnan Province, a 'two-storey' potash-forming model was set up, and, in Ordovician salt basin of northern Shaanxi Province, the area of potash prospecting target area has been largely reduced, which shows the dawn of the breakthrough in marine potash prospecting. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Tob. Sci. Technol.,"The foreign matter rejecting performance of a tobacco sorting system decreases with the attenuation of illumination, therefore the function of image intensification was incorporated on the basis of optimized Gauss homomorphic filtering algorithm. The image of tobacco leaf under low illumination was converted swiftly from its RGB (Red-Green-Blue) space into an HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value) space in order to separate color from luminance, and the luminance component V was intensified by a real-time spatial homomorphic filter, then stretched by an introduced adaptive coefficient, finally HSV was converted into RGB. The results showed that this method could effectively correct the color, contrast and luminance of an image under low illumination, well balance uneven illumination.

J. Chromatogr. A,"Porous solids composed of shape-persistent organic cage molecules have attracted considerable attention due to their important applications such as molecular separation, heterogeneous catalysis, and gas storage. In this study, an imine-linked porous organic cage (POC) CC10 diluted with a polysiloxane OV-1701 was explored as a novel stationary phase for high-resolution gas chromatography (GC). A wide variety of enantiomers belonging to different classes of organic compounds have been resolved on the coated capillary column, including chiral alcohols, esters, ketones, ethers, halohydrocarbons, epoxides, and organic acids. The fabricated column complements to commercial β-DEX 120 column and our recently reported CC3-R column for separating enantiomers, which indicates that the excellent chiral recognition ability of CC10 is not only interesting academically, but also has potential for practical application. In addition, CC10 also exhibits good selectivity for the separation of n-alkanes, n-alcohols, Grob mixture, and positional isomers. This work also indicates that this type of chiral POCs will become a new class of chiral selector in the near future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20160501859304,,"Zhang, Jun-Hui (1, 2); Xie, Sheng-Ming (2); Wang, Bang-Jin (2); He, Pin-Gang (1); Yuan, Li-Ming (1, 2) ","(1) School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai; 200241, China (2) Department of Chemistry, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",JCRAEY,801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Catalysis - Chirality - Enantiomers - Gas chromatography - Ketones - Paraffins - Separation - Silicones,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yuan, Li-Ming(yuan_limingpd@126.com) ",10.1016/j.chroma.2015.11.038,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18733778,"Number: 21275126, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; Number: 21127012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Aerospace Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 21275126 , No. 21127012 ).

"Proc. - Int. Conf. Intell. Networks Intell. Syst., ICINIS","A sunspot usually consists of a relatively dark region, called umbra, and a region surrounding the umbra, called penumbra. The penumbra includes various fine structures, like bright filaments and dark fibrils. Small and bright penumbral grains locate on the bright filaments. Studying the physical properties of penumbral grains can help us to better understand magnetic field motions in a penumbra and its formation mechanism. So we presented an automated identifying method for extracting the grains accurately. The identification method about the grains of penumbrae is composed of four steps. (1) Original image is smoothed as a mask image. Than smoothed image is eroded that as a marker image. Subsequently, the mask image is reconstructed by the marker image. (2) Many bright features are found in the difference image which is obtained between the smoothed image and reconstructed image. (3) A binary image of the difference image is obtained by adjusting the threshold value. (4) The small area bright points in the binary image are removed.

Gaodianya Jishu,"The integrated intelligent monitoring device is the basic unit of the intelligent monitoring sensor networks of power transmission and transformation equipment. In order to assess and increase the reliability of the integrated intelligent monitoring device of power transmission and transformation equipment, we proposed a Markov-process-based reliability model. The integrated intelligent monitoring device is divided into several subsystems by analyzing the internal structure and functional relationship of the components in the device. The Markov model is used to represent the state transition process of subsystems. The reliability level of the integrated intelligent monitoring device is quantized by calculation of subsystem state probability. The case study shows that the proposed reliability model can present an accurate and object quantitative evaluation of the equipment reliability and effectively identify the weak parts.

Nanoscale,"Pt activated SnO2nanoparticle clusters were synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. The structure, morphology, chemical state and specific surface area were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N2-sorption studies, respectively. The SnO2nanoparticle cluster matrix consists of tens of thousands of SnO2nanoparticles with an ultra-small grain size estimated to be 3.0 nm. And there are abundant random-packed wormhole-like pores, caused by the inter-connection of the SnO2nanoparticles, throughout each cluster. The platinum element is present in two forms including metal (Pt) and tetravalent metal oxide (PtO2) in the Pt activated SnO2nanoparticle clusters. The as-synthesized pure and Pt activated SnO2nanoparticle clusters were used to fabricate gas sensor devices. It was found that the gas response toward 500 ppm of ammonia was improved from 6.48 to 203.44 through the activation by Pt. And the results indicate that the sensor based on Pt activated SnO2not only has ultrahigh sensitivity but also possesses good response-recovery properties, linear dependence, repeatability, selectivity and long-term stability, demonstrating the potential to use Pt activated SnO2nanoparticle clusters as ammonia gas sensors.

Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao,"The havior of AlCl2 in carbothermic-chlorination-disproportionation of Al2O in vacuum was theoretically analyzed. First, the impact of the reaction conditions on the chlorination was modeled and calculated with software HSC Chemistry 6.0 and Material Studio. The calculated results show that the chlorination of the reactants, including Al2O and C, Al4C3 and Al2O3, Al4O4C and C, is possible at 1760 K and 60 Pa, and that the disproportionation of AlCl2 occurs in the upper condensation-zone of the furnace. Next, the disproportionation of AlCl2 and the chlorination of Al2O and C were dynamically simulated, by the first-principles calculation of plane-wave pseudo-potential technology based on density function theory (DFT) and in ab initio molecular dynamics method, to optimize the atomic structures. The simulated results show that AlCl2 does form in carbothermic-chlorination-disproportionation of Al2O in vacuum. The AlCl, produced by the reaction of C and adsorbed AlCl2, remains to be adsorbed on C-surfaces; and the gaseous Al2O is active in the presence of C and AlCl3 (or AlCl2).

J. Am. Chem. Soc.,"An unprecedented, crystal facet-based CeO2homojunction consisting of hexahedron prism-anchored octahedron with exposed prism surface of {100} facets and octahedron surface of {111} facets was fabricated through solution-based crystallographic-oriented epitaxial growth. The photocatalysis experiment reveals that growth of the prism arm on octahedron allows to activate inert CeO2octahedron for an increase in phototocatalytic reduction of CO2into methane. The pronounced photocatalytic performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the following three factors: (1) band alignment of the {100} and {111} drives electrons and holes to octahedron and prism surfaces, respectively, aiming to reach the most stable energy configuration and leading to a spatial charge separation for long duration; (2) crystallographic-oriented epitaxial growth of the CeO2hexahedron prism arm on the octahedron verified by the interfacial lattice fringe provides convenient and fast channels for the photogenerated carrier transportation between two units of homojuntion; (3) different effective mass of electrons and holes on {100} and {111} faces leads to high charge carrier mobility, more facilitating the charge separation. The proposed facet-based homojunction in this work may provide a new concept for the efficient separation and fast transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20153301162149,,"Li, Ping (2, 3); Zhou, Yong (1, 2, 3, 4); Zhao, Zongyan (5); Xu, Qinfeng (2); Wang, Xiaoyong (2); Xiao, Min (2); Zou, Zhigang (1, 2, 3, 4) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Modern Acoustics (MOE), Institute of Acoustics, Department of Physics, China (2) National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, China (3) Eco-Materials and Renewable Energy Research Center (ERERC), China (4) Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing; 210093, China (5) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",JACSAT,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Cerium oxide - Charge carriers - Epitaxial growth - Mass transportation - Separation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Yong(zhouyong1999@nju.edu.cn) ",10.1021/jacs.5b05926,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205126,,,,00027863,30,"August 5, 2015",English,Prisms,,36.0,9547-9550,,2015,American Chemical Society,Journal of the American Chemical Society,,Hexahedron prism-anchored octahedronal CeO2: Crystal facet-based homojunction promoting efficient solar fuel synthesis,,Charge separations - Electrons and holes - Energy configurations - Lattice fringes - Photocatalytic performance - Photogenerated carriers - Photoinduced charge carriers - Synergistic effect,137,
Fuel Process Technol,"In this study, Al2O3, ZrO2, La2O3, and Y2O3were separately introduced into Pt/CeO2-MnOxcatalyst to improve the thermal stability of catalysts and obtain a better soot and NO oxidation activity after thermal treatment. CeO2-MnOx-ROx(R = Al, La, Y, or Zr) mixed oxides were prepared by a co-precipitation method. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, H2-TPR, CO chemisorption, XPS, TG analysis, soot-TPO, and NO-TPO. It is found that the introduction of Rn+into CeO2-MnOxmarkedly increases the thermal stability of the catalysts for soot and NO oxidation, remaining a better catalytic oxidation activity. On the one hand, after high-temperature aging, for the modified catalyst Pt/CeMnROx, the ignition temperature of soot oxidation (Ti) and maximal soot oxidation rate temperature (Tm) increase by 30-50 °C and 4-32 °C, respectively, whereas Al3 +-modified catalyst shows the best thermal stability. On the other hand, due to a key role of NO2as a strong oxidizing agent in soot oxidation process, the NO oxidation activity is often considered as an important aspect. This work shows that Rn+-modified catalysts display a better stability on NO oxidation activity after aging. Some factors leading to the thermal deactivation of catalysts are also discussed in this paper. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20151700788283,,"Zhang, Hai-Long (1); Zhu, Yi (2); Wang, Shi-Dan (1); Zhao, Ming (1); Gong, Mao-Chu (1); Chen, Yao-Qiang (1, 3, 4) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Technology of the Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610064, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Hydrochina Kunming Engineering Corporation, Kunming; 650000, China (3) Sichuan Provincial Vehicular Exhaust Gases Abatement Engineering Technology Center, Chengdu; 610064, China (4) Sichuan Provincial Environmental Catalytic Material Engineering Technology Center, Chengdu; 610064, China ",FPTEDY,451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 547.1 Precious Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Catalyst activity - Cerium oxide - Dust - Manganese compounds - Oxidation - Platinum - Platinum compounds - Precipitation (chemical) - Soot - Stability - Thermodynamic stability - Zirconia,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Yao-Qiang ",10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.03.027,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013AA065304, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012FZ0008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Sichuan Provincial Youth Science and Technology Fund; ",This work was financially supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Project of China (863 Program) (grant no. 2013AA065304 ) and the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Project of China (grant no. 2012FZ0008 ).,,03783820,,"September 1, 2015",English,Catalytic oxidation,,41.0,38-47,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Fuel Processing Technology,,"Activity and thermal stability of Pt/Ce0.64Mn0.16R0.2Ox(R = Al, Zr, La, or Y) for soot and NO oxidation",,After high temperature - Catalytic oxidation activity - Coprecipitation method - Ignition temperatures - Mixed oxide - NO oxidation - Soot oxidation - Soot oxidation process,137,

Vacuum,"Abstract The formula for jamesonite is Pb4FeSb6S14(or 4PbS·FeS·3Sb2S3). This paper proposes a novel method for the separation and enrichment of PbS and Sb2S3from jamesonite by vacuum distillation. The experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 1073 K to 1473 K and at pressures less than 10,000 Pa. The amount of Sb, Pb, and Fe in the volatiles and residues was determined by chemical titration analysis and the enrichment ratios of Sb, Pb, and Fe were calculated. We discuss the influence of the distillation temperature and holding time on the enrichment ratios of each element. The results of the XRD and EDS analyses of the residues and volatiles indicates that FeS remains in the residues as the major compound, Sb exists in the form of Sb2S3, and Pb exists in the form of PbS in different condensers. Experimental results showed that Sb2S3condensed at about 725 K PbS condensed at about 984 K in different condenser. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,,20153301166381,6745,"Dong, Zhao Wang (1, 2, 3); Xiong, Heng (1, 2, 3); Deng, Yong (1, 2); Yang, Bin (1, 3); Zhao, Jin Yang (1, 3); Dai, Yong Nian (1, 2, 3); Wang, Jia Ju (1, 2, 3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metals Resources Clear Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) National Engineering Laboratory of Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Vacuum Metallurgy of Non-ferrous Metals of Yunnan Province, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",VACUAV,545.1 Iron - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Blast enrichment - Distillation - Iron - Iron compounds - IV-VI semiconductors - Separation - Titration,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xiong, Heng(57160741@qq.com) ",10.1016/j.vacuum.2015.07.009,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: U1202271, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013FZ028, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: IRT1250, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014RA4018, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51304096, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors are grateful for financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51304096 ), the Applied Fundamental Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2013FZ028 ), the Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China (No. IRT1250 ), Innovation team in the key areas of non-ferrous metal vacuum metallurgy ( 2014RA4018 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan United Fund (No. U1202271 ).",,0042207X,,"August 10, 2015",English,Antimony compounds,,16.0,48-55,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Vacuum,,Separation and enrichment of PbS and Sb2S3from jamesonite by vacuum distillation,,Chemical titration - Distillation temperature - EDS analysis - Enrichment ratio - Holding time - Jamesonite - Vacuum distillation,121,
Laser Phys.,"Electron-photon backscattering lasers are discussed. For producing a laser by means of the backscattering of an incident laser and a monochromatic electron beam, the intensity of the incident laser must be large. The incident laser can form a laser standing wave in a laser standing wave cavity. When the coherence conditions are satisfied, the laser standing wave can cause temporal coherence and spatial coherence of the backscattering light, so the backscattering light can form a quasi-laser or laser. A way of obtaining a better monochromatic electron beam is proposed.

TMS Annu Meet,"The novel technology of calcination to prepare triuranium octaoxide (U3O8) from ammonium uranyl carbonate in microwave fields was investigated on the basis of the temperature rising characteristics of ammonium uranyl carbonate, triuranium octaoxide (U3O8), and their mixture. The result of experiments show that ammonium uranyl carbonate had weak capability to absorb microwave energy, while triuranium octaoxide has the very strong capability to absorb microwave energy and the sample temperature increased rapidly with an increase mixture ratio of triuranium octaoxide. The optimal calcination conditions were as follows: microwave power 700 W, calcination time 10 min and 60 g in this experiments range, respectively. Under these conditions the value of total uranium and U4+of triuranium octaoxide was 84.28% and 31.02%, respectively.

Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao,"The feasibility of the enrichment of Sb2S3from jamesonite by vacuum distillation was theoretically analyzed. The impact of the distillation conditions, including but not limited to the distillation temperature, holding time, pressure and contents of impurities, on the Sb2S3volatilization rate was experimentally investigated with X-ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and conventional chemical analysis. The preliminary results show that depending on the distillation temperature, the enrichment of Sb2S3from jamesonite by vacuum distillation is feasible. For example, as the distillation temperature increased, the Sb_ volatilization rate increased, but the Sb-content in the condensate changed in an increase-decrease mode. Distilled at 973 K and held for 30 min, the volatilization rate of Sb2S3was found to be 92.84%, and the Sb-content in the condensate was estimated to be 68.47%. We suggest that the newly-developed vacuum distillation may outperform the conventional Sb-extraction from jamesonite by smelting because of the reduced environmental pollution, simplified operation and decreased power consumption. © 2015, Science Press.

Some important features need to be added and optimized to medical image sharing. In this paper, we present an extensible Web Access to DICOM Persistent Objects (WADO) middleware based on image cache and real-time Web monitor technology for regional medical image sharing. We first develop the extension method of WADO standard and workflow of extended WADO service. Then, we design a medical image cache method to improve the performance of medical image on-demand transmission. Using the real-time monitor can discover the performance bottlenecks and optimized critical points. The experimental results show that the middleware effectively delivers medical images and reports to Web clients over the Internet, regardless of the platform used for access. It can be deployed in one hospital to provide WADO service to medical workers and also can be applied to regional picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) to transmit medical images and reports to Internet users in a way that is transparent to end-user applications. © 2015, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.",,,20151300691675,,"Liu, Lijun (1); Liu, Li (2); Fu, Xiaodong (2); Huang, Qingsong (2); Zhang, Yin (3); Luo, Qiaoyi (2); Xiong, Xin (1) ","(1) Department of Biomedical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Department of Computer Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Room 403, Building Xinzi, No. 727, South Jingming Rd., Chenggong District, Kunming City; Yunnan Province, China (3) Information Centre, Kunming Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming; 650051, China ",JDIMEW,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 746 Imaging Techniques",,,,,Computer aided diagnosis - Electronic document exchange - Image enhancement - Medical applications - mHealth - Middleware - Picture archiving and communication systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Qingsong(kmustailab@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/s10278-015-9790-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1618727X,,,,08971889,5,"October 23, 2015",English,Medical imaging,,21.0,547-557,,2015,Springer New York LLC,Journal of Digital Imaging,,SmartWADO: an Extensible WADO Middleware for Regional Medical Image Sharing,,DICOM - Image cache - Regional medical image sharing - WADO - Web monitors,28,
Water,"Water fountains are part of every human settlement, and historical and mythological stories. They are the source from which life-sustaining water was distributed to people until piped systems started providing fresh tap water inside buildings. In many places, people visit fountains to experience the freshness of running water, to prepare for prayers, or to make a wish. Fountains have also provided water for the people of cities under siege, and purified believers as part of holy rites. The Castalia shrine in Delphi, Greece, for its part, is a spot where various groups of people come to socialize, which greatly improves the quality of their lives. This paper is a look back through the history of fountains in various parts of the world. Experts from various areas have identified the historic, cultural, and ritualistic aspects of fountains and their findings are summarized. The paper concludes by providing a glimpse into the role of fountains in modern society and their continued influence in our lives today. © 2015 by the authors.",,Open Access,20153201153550,,"Juuti, Petri S.

J. Ultrasound Med.,"Objectives-This study aimed to evaluate the utility of an automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) versus handheld ultrasound (US) for identifying implanted mesh after incisional hernia repair. Methods-In vitro, the appearances of 3 samples of different flat mesh and a mesh plug on both ABVS and handheld US examinations were evaluated. In vivo, 97 patients received both ABVS and handheld US examinations in the incisional region. The frequency used for handheld US was 11 MHz. The presence of the previously implanted mesh in the incisional region was evaluated and compared between the US modalities. The identified results were confirmed by surgical findings. Results-In the in vitro study, the ABVS had more visualized and efficient imaging results for implanted mesh than handheld US. In the in vivo study, among 97 cases, 39 and 32 were identified as regions with mesh by the ABVS and handheld US, respectively. The ABVS had better identification performance than handheld US in terms of accuracy (94.8% versus 83.5%), sensitivity (90.5% versus 69.0%), and specificity (98.2% versus 94.5%). The ? values showed that handheld US had substantial agreement with surgical findings (? = 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.90), whereas the ABVS had almost perfect agreement with surgical findings (κ = 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.00). More importantly, the ABVS could display the texture of lightweight mesh in the coronal plane. The specificity and sensitivity for mesh texture were 100.0% (55 of 55) and 94.4% (17 of 18), respectively. Conclusions-The use of an ABVS may help identify the presence of implanted mesh after incisional hernia repair in some cases in which the implant is difficult to appreciate on handheld US imaging with an 11-MHz transducer. © 2015 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.",,Open Access,20152200894526,,"Wu, Jun (1, 2); Wang, Yuanyuan (1, 3); Yu, Jinhua (1); Chen, Yue (4); Pang, Yun (4); Diao, Xuehong (4); Qiu, Zhiying (4) ","(1) Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai; 200433, China (2) Department of Electronic Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (3) Key Laboratory of Medical Imaging Computing, Computer-Assisted Intervention of Shanghai, Shanghai, China (4) Department of Ultrasound, Huadong Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China ",JUMEDA,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723.5 Computer Applications - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 913.5 Maintenance,,,,,Automation - Medical computing - Repair - Scanning - Surgery,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yuanyuan(yywang@fudan.edu.cn) ",10.7863/ultra.34.6.1071,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15509613,,,,02784297,6,"June 1, 2015",English,Mesh generation,,20.0,1071-1081,,2015,American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine,,Identification of implanted mesh after incisional hernia repair using an automated breast volume scanner,,Automated breast volume scanner - Confidence interval - Coronal planes - Handheld ultrasound - Handhelds - Incisional hernia - Mesh - Point of care,34,

IEEE Photon. J.,"Effect of cerium codoping on Stokes or anti-Stokes luminescence of BiOCl:Er3+crystals, which were controlled by a special photon avalanche (PA) mechanism under 980-nm excitation, was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicate that Ce3+ions were successfully doped into BiOCl lattices. However, in PA photoluminescence behaviors, the doped Ce3+ions did not present efficient resonant energy transfer (ET) processes between the Er3+ions as generally reported. As a result, the intensity of visible PA upconversion emission and 1.54 μm downshifting near-infrared (NIR) emission of Er3+ions shows the same concentration dependence of cerium dopants. This phenomenon can be understood by the influence of cerium dopant content on the magnitude of internal electric field in layered BiOCl crystals, which may play a more important role on the upconversion (UC) and NIR luminescence of Er3+than the traditional ET between rare-earth (RE) ions. The results of our work may offer a different understanding for the method to control the emissions of RE ions. © 2015 IEEE.",,Open Access,20153701260424,7214202,"Liu, Qun (1); Li, Yongjin (2); Kuang, Qingliang (1); Song, Zhiguo (1); Wan, Ronghua (1); Zhou, Yuting (1); Xu, Zuyuan (1); Hu, Rui (1); Qiu, Jianbei (1); Yang, Zhengwen (1); Yin, Zhaoyi (1) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Department of Science Research, Yunnan Technology and Business University, Kunming; 651700, China ",,531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Bismuth compounds - Cerium - Chlorine compounds - Doping (additives) - Electric fields - Energy transfer - Infrared devices - Ions - Luminescence - Metallic glass - Photons - Rare earths - Uranium compounds - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Zhiguo(songzg@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2460115,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,19430655,5,"October 1, 2015",English,X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,,27.0,,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Photonics Journal,,Unusual effect of cerium codoping on stokes and anti-stokes luminescence of BiOCl:Er3+crystal,,Co-doped - Concentration dependence - Internal electric fields - Near-infrared emissions - NIR emission - Photon avalanche - Resonant energy transfer - Stokes and anti-Stokes,7,
Proc IEEE Int Conf Prop Appl Dielectr Mater,"Gas insulation switchgear (GIS) has been widely used in electrical power systems for decades due to its good compactness and tightness, slight impact on the environment, and long maintenance cycle. However, it has been noticed that the failures of GIS insulation due to very fast transient overvoltages (VFTOs) increases with the increase of voltage levels. In this paper, a generating system of VFTO and standard lightning impulse (SLI) was established. Using the system, the breakdown characteristics of SF6gas gaps under VFTO and SLI were studied. The results show that SF6gap has polarity effect in both quasi-uniform field and highly inhomogenous electric field. Under quasi-uniform field, the 50% breakdown voltages under VFTO and SLI with positive polarity are higher than those with negative polarity. But for the highly inhomogenous electric field, the polarity effect is remarkable and polarity reversion phenomenon is observed. When the pressure of SF6is lower, the 50% breakdown voltages under SLI with negative polarity are higher than those with positive polarity. Nevertheless, the 50% breakdown voltages under SLI with positive polarity are higher than those with negative polarity when the pressure of SF6exceeds a critical pressure. The critical pressure decreases with the increase of the electric field non-uniform factor. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that the reasons for polarity effect can be explained by the migration and proliferation of space charge. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161302147298,7295236,"Wen, Tao (1); Zhang, Qiaogen (1); Qin, Yifan (1); Tao, Fengbo (2); Jia, Yongyong (2); Tan, Xiangyu (3); You, Haoyang (1); Wang, Tonglei (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an; 710049, China (2) Jiangsu Electric Power Company Research Institute, Nanjing; 211103, China (3) Yunnan Electric Power Test and Research Institute Group CO., LTD., Electric Power Research Institute, Kunming; 650217, China ",PPAMF7,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 706.1.2 Electric Power Distribution - 708.1 Dielectric Materials - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.1 Mechanics,117583.0,"July 19, 2015 - July 22, 2015","Sydney, NSW, Australia","11th IEEE International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials, ICPADM 2015",Electric breakdown - Electric power systems - Electromagnetic wave emission - Lightning - Power quality - Pressure - SF6 insulation - Sulfur hexafluoride,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICPADM.2015.7295236,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479989034.0,,,"October 8, 2015",English,Dielectric materials,ICPADM 2015 - 2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials,12.0,172-175,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials,Macey's Electrical Pty.

Gaodeng Xuexiao Huaxue Xuebao,"A new imine-linked covalent organic framework (COF) material was synthesized using organic monomer via solvothermal methods. Pd(II)-coordinated COF, Pd/COF-LZU1, was accordingly synthesized through simple post-treatment at ambient conditions, which showed excellent catalytic activity. Then, a label-free C-reactive protein (CRP) immunosensor was constructed using the Pd/COF-LZUI porous composite material to immobilize anti-CRP on the surface of GCE. When anti-CRP binds with CRP antigen, the formed immuno complex obstruct the electric signal of Fe(CN)64-/3-, which can be used to realize label-free detection of CRP. Electrochemical impedence spectroscopy (EIS) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were employed to characterize the immunosensor. The experimental conditions such as scanning rate, pH value of testing solution, the concentration of anti-CRP and incubation time were also optimized. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the linear range was 5-180 ng/mL, the detection limit was 1.66 ng/mL, with the linear correlation coefficient of 0.992.

RSC Adv.,"Pure MnO2nanorods and MnO2nanorod/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposites are prepared for microwave absorption by using a simple one-step hydrothermal method without using any toxic solvents. The results demonstrate that the MnO2phases possess a high crystallization degree in both the pure nanorods and the nanocomposites but the nanocomposites exhibit two hybrid Mn phases, distinct from MnO2in the pure nanorods. The electromagnetic characteristics and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption properties of the materials are investigated. The thickness dependent reflection loss shows that the peak frequency and effective absorption bandwidth all decrease with the increasing material thickness. Compared with the pure MnO2nanorods, the introduction of RGO enhances the microwave absorbing intensity and effective absorption bandwidth. The maximum reflection loss value of the nanocomposites reaches -37 dB at 16.8 GHz with a thickness of 2.0 mm and the wide bandwidth corresponding to the reflection loss below -10 dB starts from 13 GHz until a value of -22 dB at 18 GHz. The enhanced microwave absorbing properties can be ascribed to the improved permittivity, dielectric loss and especially the synergistic effects between MnO2nanorods and RGO nanosheets at their interfaces in the unique nanostructures of the MnO2/RGO nanocomposites. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,20154401464675,,"Wang, Yan (1); Guan, Hongtao (1); Du, Shangfeng (2); Wang, Yude (1, 3) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham Edgbaston, Birmingham; B15 2TT, United Kingdom (3) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,708.1 Dielectric Materials - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Bandwidth - Dielectric losses - Electromagnetic waves - Graphene - Hydrothermal synthesis - Manganese oxide - Microwaves - Nanocomposites - Nanosheets,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Du, Shangfeng(s.du@bham.ac.uk) ",10.1039/c5ra15165a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,108,2015,English,Nanorods,,53.0,88979-88988,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,A facile hydrothermal synthesis of MnO2nanorod-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites possessing excellent microwave absorption properties,,Absorption property - Effective absorption - Electromagnetic characteristic - Hydrothermal methods - Microwave absorbing properties - Microwave absorption - Microwave absorption properties - Reduced graphene oxides,5,

To protect the source location privacy, this paper proposes a novel Angle-Based Directed Random Walk (ABDRW) routing protocol, which makes the selection of phantom source more flexible and the distribution relatively uniform. What's more, this approach can generate more different phantom sources that are far away from the real source, and thus enhances the source location privacy protection.

Mater. Res. Innov.,"The response characteristics of iron smelting reduction of copper slags were studied in this paper. With the molten slag basicity of 1·4, the γ (FeO) takes nearly a maximum value equalling to 4·27. The diffusion of (FeO) through the molten slag boundary layer to the molten slag-iron interface is found to be the rate-limiting step for the process of (FeO) smelting reduction. In a certain range, the iron smelting reduction rate increases obviously with the increase of residence time and reductant addition amounts. Result of iron smelting reduction rate of 93·64% is obtained in the optimal conditions: (i) N2flow rate of 0·3 L min-1; (ii) molten slag basicity of 1·4; (iii) holding temperature of 1848 K; (iv) residence time of 30 minutes and (v) the reductant addition amounts of 1·2 (mass ratio of the anthracite and copper slags). © W.

Wood Sci Technol,"The competitive formation of the methylene and methylene ether bridges in the urea–formaldehyde reaction in alkaline solution was investigated by using13C NMR and quantum chemistry calculations. Despite that the classical theory states that the condensations of methylolureas only form methylene ether bridges at alkaline pH, the competing formation of methylene bridges was observed in this study. The NMR spectra show that the methylene ether bridges are exclusively formed under conditions of 80 and 90 °C with F/U = 2/1. At 80 °C with F/U = 1/1, the linear methylene bridge (–NH–CH2–NH–) began to compete with ether bridges, but it was minor. At 90 °C with F/U = 1/1, the methylene bridges were found to be much more competitive. The theoretically calculated energy barriers for the formation of different types of methylene ether bridges are lower than those for methylene bridges by 12–26 kJ/mol. The steric hindrance was proposed to be another important effect that suppresses the condensations between di- and tri-methylolureas to form the branched methylene bridges [–(HOCH2)N–CH2–NH– or –(HOCH2)N–CH2–N(CH2OH)–]. However, the reaction between a free amino group –NH2and a methylol group –CH2OH was proposed to encounter no steric hindrance. Hence, once the higher temperature and lower F/U ratio were guaranteed, the competitive formation of linear methylene bridges was observed. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20151100640878,,"Li, Taohong (1, 2); Guo, Xiaoshen (2); Liang, Jiankun (2); Wang, Hui (2); Xie, Xiaoguang (3); Du, Guanben (1, 2) ","(1) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing; 210037, China (2) The Key Lab of Wood Adhesives and Glued Products of Yunnan Province, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming; 650224, China (3) Department of Chemistry, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",WOSTBE,"801.1 Chemistry, General - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,,Alkalinity - Condensation - Ethers - Formaldehyde - Metabolism - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Quantum chemistry - Urea,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Du, Guanben(dgb510@163.com) ",10.1007/s00226-015-0711-2,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,00437719,3,"May 1, 2015",English,Complexation,,36.0,475-493,,2015,Springer Verlag,Wood Science and Technology,,Competitive formation of the methylene and methylene ether bridges in the urea–formaldehyde reaction in alkaline solution: a combined experimental and theoretical study,,Alkaline solutions - Classical theory - Ether bridges - Free amino groups - Methylene bridge - Quantum chemistry calculations - Steric hindrances - Theoretical study,49,

Astron. Astrophys.,"Aims. Two C-type main-belt asteroids (171) Ophelia and (360) Carlova are studied for their spin parameters and shapes in the present paper. Although it was suspected that Ophelia was a binary system owing to the eclipse features in the light curve obtained in 1977, no direct evidence has been obtained to confirm the binarity. To verify the previous findings, the spin parameters and shape of Ophelia are derived by analyzing the photometric data. To understand the dispersion in the previous determination of Carlova's spin parameters, new observational data and existing photometric data are reanalyzed to find a homogenous solution for its spin parameters and shape. Methods. The spin parameters and shapes of two asteroids were determined from photometric data using the convex inversion technique. The simplified virtual-observation Markov chain Monte Carlo method was applied to estimate the uncertainties of the spin parameters and to understand the divergence of derived shapes. Results.

Two C-type main-belt asteroids (171) Ophelia and (360) Carlova are studied for their spin parameters and shapes in the present paper. Although it was suspected that Ophelia was a binary system owing to the eclipse features in the light curve obtained in 1977, no direct evidence has been obtained to confirm the binarity. To verify the previous findings, the spin parameters and shape of Ophelia are derived by analyzing the photometric data. To understand the dispersion in the previous determination of Carlova’s spin parameters, new observational data and existing photometric data are reanalyzed to find a homogenous solution for its spin parameters and shape. Methods. The spin parameters and shapes of two asteroids were determined from photometric data using the convex inversion technique. The simplified virtual-observation Markov chain Monte Carlo method was applied to estimate the uncertainties of the spin parameters and to understand the divergence of derived shapes. Results. A pair of possible poles for Ophelia are derived, the spin periods corresponding to the two poles are nearly the same. The convex shape of Ophelia shows binary characteristics. For Carlova, a unique pole solution and its convex shape are ascertained together with the occultation observations. The convex shape of Carlova shows that it is a rough ellipsoid. minor planets, asteroids: individual: (171) Ophelia minor planets, asteroids: individual: (360) Carlova idline A&A 581, A55 (2015) cover_date September 2015 first_month 9 last_month 9 first_year 2015 last_year 2015 This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (contracts Nos. 11073051 and 10933004) and the Academy of Finland (contract No. 127461).

Adv. Energ. Sci. Equip. Eng. - Proc. Int. Conf. Energ. Equip. Sci. Eng.,"CdS quantum dots were deposited on the surface of TiO2nanorods by continuous ion adsorption and reaction method to prepare CdS sensitized TiO2nano-electrodes. Systematic analysis such as scanning the electronic microscope, J-V characteristic curves were employed to analyze and characterize the nano-electrodes. The results show that: (1) The short circuit current density of TiO2photoanode solar cell shows a good performance: in the dark it is 1.60 × 10−3A ⋅ cm−2and under the ultraviolet illumination it is 2.32 × 10−3A ⋅ cm−2. (2) The deposition cycles of CdS quantum dots on the surface of TiO2nano-electrodes have a significant impact on the open circuit voltage, fill factor and photoelectric conversion efficiency. In particular, 4-cycle deposition suggests better parameters than 2-cycle deposition: in the dark, the open circuit voltage and short circuit current are 0.95 V and 2.70 × 10−5A/cm−2, respectively; under the ultraviolet illumination, the open circuit voltage and short circuit current are 1.15 V and 9.43 × 10−5A/cm−2, respectively. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20160902044475,,"Zhao, Liuying (1, 2); Zhou, Fufang (1, 2); Han, Songjie (1, 2); Wang, Ping (1, 2); Jing, Bi (1, 2) ","(1) School of Physics and Electronic Information Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan, China (2) School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Cadmium sulfide - Deposition - Electrodes - II-VI semiconductors - Nanocrystals - Nanorods - Open circuit voltage - Photoelectricity - Short circuit currents - Solar cells - Titanium dioxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781138029330.0,,,2015,English,Semiconductor quantum dots,"Advances in Energy Science and Equipment Engineering - Proceedings of International Conference on Energy Equipment Science and Engineering, ICEESE 2015",13.0,207-209,1 of 1,2015,CRC Press/Balkema,"Advances in Energy Science and Equipment Engineering - Proceedings of International Conference on Energy Equipment Science and Engineering, ICEESE 2015",,Researches on TiO2nanometer electrode of CdS quantum dots sensitized solar cells,,CdS quantum dots - Deposition cycles - Electronic microscopes - J-V characteristics - Nano-electrodes - Photo-electric conversion efficiency - Systematic analysis - Ultraviolet illumination,1,
"Proc. Chin. Control Decis. Conf., CCDC","Sensor technology is a key technology in the field of Internet of Things(IoT), which has been applied to the research on task scheduling of embedded systems in wireless sensor networks (WSN), it affects the existence and uniqueness of the real-time interactive behavior for IoT service, as well as the energy consumption modeling and evaluation of WSN deployment on the background of real-time embedded control systems. In this paper, through further studies on the kernel scheduling mechanism of TinyOS, aiming at its shortcomings, a lightweight scheduling strategy - quick sort scheduling strategy based on dynamic priority of tasks queue (TQS-DP) was proposed. This strategy changes the priority of tasks dynamically, and quickly put them into queues with quick sort. Meanwhile, the timeout management of tasks is taken into consideration. Whether the priority level of the task is high or low, it can be executed in due time. Finally, the simulation experiments show that our method cannot only improve the task throughput of the whole wireless sensor networks (WSNs), but also effectively reduce the energy consumption of system, in order to ensure the real-time performance, determinacy and casuality dependency of task scheduling. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20154401482460,7162151,"Jing, Zhang (1, 2); Leng, Xue (1, 2); Fan, Hongbo (1, 2); Yi, Cui (3) ","(1) Computer Technology Application Key Lab of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (2) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (3) Yunnan Academy of Scientific and Technical Information, Kunming Yunnan, China ",,,115665.0,"May 23, 2015 - May 25, 2015","Qingdao, China","27th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2015",,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fan, Hongbo ",10.1109/CCDC.2015.7162151,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479970179.0,,,"July 17, 2015",English,,"Proceedings of the 2015 27th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2015",17.0,1470-1475,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of the 2015 27th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2015",,TQS-DP: A lightweight and active mechanism for fast scheduling based on WSN operating system TinyOS,,,,
Optik,"Bi-doped zinic silicate glasses (SG) and germanate glasses (GG) were prepared and the relationship between Bi near infrared (NIR) luminescence and the glass structures were investigated. The absorption, visible luminescence, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra revealed that the lower valence state of Bi ions containing NIR active centers increased with the decrease of optical basicity in the two sets of glasses. However, the NIR emission in these glasses cannot be merely explained by the theory of optical basicity. In the SG glasses, there is no obvious structural change, the NIR luminescence can be well interpreted by theory of optical basicity. But there is a distinct transformation in the GG glasses, the abnormal fluorescence phenomenon can be connected with the local structure regulating effect. The mechanisms of the NIR emission and local structure regulating effect were discussed. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

J Rare Earth,"Effect of divalent dopants, Zn2+ion, on the high-order photon avalanche (PA) upconversion (UC) emission of Er3+doped BiOCl microcrystals was investigated. XRD results indicated that Zn2+ion dopants would mostly enter into the lattice space at low and moderate doping concentration, and began to substitute Bi3+ion gradually at heavily doping level. Under exaction at 980 nm, the PA UC of violet, green and red emission of Er3+ions could be observed, and the UC emission intensity increased with increasing the Zn2+addition below 8 mol.%, then decreased with further addition. Power dependence study showed that the dopant concentration of Zn2+had no obviously negative effect on the occurrence of PA emission. On the bases of results investigated herein, we considered that the lattice distortion by Zn2+doping could not directly change the special PA emission of BiOCl:Er3+, but would improve the emission intensity when used as lattice modifier. © 2015 The Chinese Society of Rare Earths.",,,20154201386500,60532,"Liu, Qun (1); Li, Yongjin (2); Song, Zhiguo (1); Wan, Ronghua (1); Zhou, Yuting (1); Qiu, Jianbei (1); Yang, Zhengwen (1); Yin, Zhaoyi (1) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Department of Science Research, Yunnan Technology and Business University, Kunming; 651700, China ",JREAE6,804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Chlorine compounds - Doping (additives) - Erbium compounds - Ions - Photons - Rare earths - Uranium compounds - Zinc compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Zhiguo(songzg@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/S1002-0721(14)60532-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10020721,10,October 2015,English,Bismuth compounds,,30.0,1098-1103,,2015,Chinese Society of Rare Earths,Journal of Rare Earths,,Effect of Zn2+dopant on photon avalanche upconversion behavior of BiOCl:Er3+crystals,,Divalent dopants - Dopant concentrations - Doping concentration - Emission intensity - Lattice distortions - Photon avalanche - Power dependence - Up-conversion,33,

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"Bifunctional magnetic nanobeads (bi-MBs) were fabricated by co-immobilizing target recognition molecules and signal molecules on a magnetic nanobead surface, which were used as both separation and enrichment carriers and signal carriers. The bi-MBs could capture and separate avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (H7N9 AIV) from complex samples efficiently based on the specific reaction between antigen-antibody and their good magnetic response, which simplified sample pretreatment and saved the detection time. Taking advantages of their high surface to volume ratio and rich surface functional groups, multiple alkaline phosphatase (ALP) signal molecules were tethered on the surface of bi-MBs which greatly amplified the detection signal. As an efficient signal amplification strategy, enzyme-induced metallization had been integrated with bi-MBs and anodic stripping voltammetry to construct an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for H7N9 AIV detection. Under the optimal conditions, the introduction of bi-MBs could amplify the detection signal in about four times compared with the same immunoassay without MBs, and the method showed a wide linear range of 0.01-20. ng/mL with a detection limit of 6.8 pg/mL. The electrochemical immunosensor provides a simple and reliable platform with high sensitivity and selectivity which shows great potential in early diagnosis of diseases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20150600498922,,"Wu, Zhen (1); Zhou, Chuan-Hua (1, 2); Chen, Jian-Jun (3); Xiong, Chaochao (3); Chen, Ze (4); Pang, Dai-Wen (1); Zhang, Zhi-Ling (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University, Wuhan; 430072, China (2) Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource (Ministry of Education), School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan; 430071, China (4) Shanghai Institute of Biological Products, China ",BBIOE4,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 539.3 Metal Plating - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Antigens - Chemical detection - Diagnosis - Immunosensors - Magnetism - Metallizing - Molecules - Nanostructured materials - Phosphatases - Separation - Viruses - Voltammetry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Jian-Jun ",10.1016/j.bios.2015.01.051,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,"Number: 2011CB933600, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013AA032204, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CFA003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province; Number: 21175100, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21475099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2042014kf0196, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Zhen Wu and Chuan-Hua Zhou contributed equally to this work.

Polymer,"Well-defined cyclic poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (c-PNVCL) was successfully synthesized by a combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), supramolecular self-assembly and 'selective' click cyclization at a relatively high concentration (10 mg/mL). α-Alkyne-ω-chloro heterodifunctional PNVCL precursor (l-PNVCL-Cl) was synthesized by ATRP of N-vinylcaprolactam (NVCL), followed by its conversion to α-alkyne-ω-azido heterodifunctional PNVCL (l-PNVCL-N3) via nucleophilic substitution reaction with NaN3. The intramolecular cyclization of l-PNVCL-N3 by 'selective' click reaction in aqueous micellar media afforded well-defined and narrow-disperse c-PNVCL (PDI = 1.11). The target polymer and intermediates were characterized by GPC/MALLS, 1H NMR, and FT-IR. The thermoresponsive property of c-PNVCL and its linear precursor (l-PNVCL-N3) was studied and compared by turbidity and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, and furthermore, their self-assembly behavior was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cyclic poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) can self-assemble to form smaller spherical micelles in aqueous solution and possesses lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and narrower thermal phase transition range in comparison with its linear analogue. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol.,"The eutectic mixture of lauric acid (LA) and stearic acid (SA) is a desirable phase change material (PCM) due to the constant melting temperature and large latent heat. However, its poor thermal conductivity has hampered its broad utilization. In the present study, pure LA, SA and the mixtures with various mass fractions of LA-SA were used as the basic PCMs, and 10 wt% expanded graphite (EG) was added to enhance the thermal conductivities. The phase change behaviors, microstructural analysis, thermal conductivities and thermal stabilities of the mixtures of PCMs were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electronic microscope (SEM), transient plane source (TPS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The results show that the LA-SA binary mixture of mixture ratio of 76.3 wt%: 23.7 wt% forms an eutectic mixture, which melts at 38.99 - C and has a latent heat of 159.94 J/g. The melted fatty acids are well absorbed by the porous network of EG and they have a good thermal stability. Furthermore, poor thermal conductivities can be well enhanced by the addition of EG.

Gaodianya Jishu,"To provide safe and reliable power supply for the on-line monitoring system equipped around the transmission line, we proposed an electric field energy harvesting method to harvest electric field energy away from the power transmission line. The principle of the proposed electric field energy harvesting method was analyzed, and the palisade harvester was designed based on the fringe effect of plate capacitor. The principle and the effect of palisade harvester were verified by experiment, in which the stray capacitance was 43 pF between the harvester and the upper plate of the electric field generator, when the testing voltage was 50 kV, about 257 mW was obtained on a 300 Φ resistor. By optimizing the harvesting plate, enough energy can be harvested to power the transmission on-line monitoring system. © 2015, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPI.

Planet. Space Sci.,"The physical properties of asteroids, such as their spin and shape, are very important for understanding the formation and evolution of the entire asteroid belt, as well as the individual asteroid itself. However, only a small part of asteroids had been determined accurately for their spin parameters and shapes due to lack of data or narrow aspect angle distribution of dataset. In the present paper, the spin parameters and convex shapes of two C-type main-belt asteroids (362) Havnia and (506) Marion are analyzed using the convex inversion method and the virtual-photometry Monte Carlo method. A pair of poles are found for (362) Havnia at (96°.2-2.0+3.0,+38°.8-2.4+6.8) and (273°.0-6.5+1.3,+40°.0-9.9+1.2) in ecliptic coordinates, the spin period values corresponding to the two poles are 16.918773-6.4(-6)+2.8(-5) h (here +2.8(-5) represents +2.8×10-5) and 16.918935-4.3(-5)+1.2(-5) h, respectively. Similarly, two candidate poles are found for (506) Marion at (88°.0-0.3+1.3,+22°.3-1.5+1.3) and (264°.5-0.03+1.2,-7°.5-0.92+1.1). The spin periods for the two poles are 13.549826-9.8(-6)+1.2(-5) h and 13.549751-5.9(-6)+1.3(-5) h. The shapes of Havnia for the pair of poles approximate to Maclaurin spheroids. Whereas the convex shapes of Marion for the two poles are prolate shapes, and it rotates around the longest axis. The significant divergence of weight coefficients c for Havina and Marion implies different materials on the two asteroids' surface. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Electron. Commun. Netw. - Proc. Int. Conf. Electron. Commun. Netw.,"In the process of acquiring and transmitting images, the quality of the images are heavily decreased by noise. Removing the noise plays an important role in restoring the images. In reality, an image may be corrupted by major noise, such as salt-and-pepper noise or additive white Gauss noise. This paper presents a method that functions in order to decrease salt-and-pepper noise and Gauss noise in an image. The traditional denoising method has already been introduced by previous studies. In this paper, to create a new method, which can resist both noises mentioned above, a denoising method based on the combination of lifting the wavelet transformation and a median filter is proposed. This paper makes a comparison between our method and other denoising methods. Our method proves to be more effective. These methods are compared with others based on PSNR,SNR, and MSE between the original images and the denoised images. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20161102097549,,"Deng, Xiangyu (1); Liu, Zengli (1) ","(1) The Department of Information Engineering and Automation, KunMing University of Science and Technology, KunMing, YunNan, China ",,703.2 Electric Filters - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations,142839.0,"December 12, 2014 - December 15, 2014","Beijing, China","4th International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Networks, CECNet2014",Bandpass filters - Median filters - Signal to noise ratio - Wavelet transforms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781138028302.0,,,2015,English,Image denoising,"Electronics, Communications and Networks IV - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Networks, CECNet2014",10.0,1379-1382,1 of 1,2015,,"Electronics, Communications and Networks IV - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Networks, CECNet2014",,Image denoising research based on lifting wavelet transform and median filter,,Denoising methods - Gauss noise - Lifting wavelet transforms - Original images - Salt-and-pepper noise - Wavelet transformations - White gauss noise,2,
J. Cent. South Univ.,"To make sure the intermediate products of the carbothermic reduction of Al2O3process, such as Al4CO4, Al2CO and Al4C3, and the interaction of AlCl, AlCl2, AlCl3with Al4CO4, Al2CO and Al4C3, respectively, thermodynamic analyses were used to study the chloride reaction production of them under the vacuum situation. The stable structures and electronic properties of AlCl, AlCl2and AlCl3adsorbed on Al4CO4, Al2CO and Al4C3were calculated by first-principles calculations by the CASTEP module in the Materials Studio program. The results show that the AlCl3and AlCl2molecules have decomposed on the plane of Al4C3(001), while there are no obvious decomposition of AlCl3and AlCl2on Al4CO4(001) and Al2CO (001) planes. The adsorption of AlCl on the Al4CO4(001) and Al2CO (001) planes is stronger than that on the Al4C3(001) plane. The interaction strength of AlCl3, as well as AlCl2, with Al4CO4, Al2CO and Al4C3is in the sequence of Al4CO42CO4C3, while the interaction strength of AlCl with Al4CO4, Al2CO and Al4C3is in the sequence of Al4CO4>Al2CO>Al4C3. © 2015, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20150400442307,,"Duan, Shao-fei (1, 2); Chen, Xiu-min (1, 2); Yang, Bin (1, 2); Yu, Qing-chun (1, 2); Xu, Bao-qiang (1, 2); Liu, Da-chun (1, 2) ","(1) National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Nonferrous Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming; 650093, China ",,801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Alumina - Aluminum chloride - Aluminum oxide - Calculations - Carbothermal reduction - Electronic properties - Reaction intermediates - Thermoanalysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Xiu-min(chenxiumin9@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/s11771-015-2493-y,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22275223,,,,20952899,1,2015,English,Chlorine compounds,,24.0,43-58,,2015,Central South University of Technology,Journal of Central South University,,"Calculation of interaction of AlCl, AlCl2and AlCl3on Al4C3(001) Al4CO4(001) and Al2CO (001) planes",,Ab initio - Al2CO - Al4C3 - Al4CO4 - chloride reaction,22,
Mater. Trans.,"Three kinds of Cu-Al alloys and a pure Cu sample with different stacking fault energies (SFEs) are deformed using room temperature rolling (RR) and high pressure torsion (HPT), respectively. The microstructure is analysed by means of transaction electron microscopy and Xray diffraction. It is found that HPT is more feasible to obtain nanocrystals and profuse twins. Tailoring the SFE can promote sample strength without sacrificing the ductility of the Cu alloys. The tensile properties of samples processed by HPT and RR are compared. It is discovered that the HPT process leads to the strain softening phenomenon in samples with relatively high SFE. The excellent mechanical properties can be obtained in samples deformed by HPT with a SFE of 6mJ/m2, in which strain softening was restrained and strain hardening played a dominant role in the deformation process. The relationship between tensile properties and microstructures of the deformed metals is also investigated. © 2015 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.",,Open Access,20154001332276,,"Pang, Yanzhao (1); Li, Peng (1); Kim, Hyoung Seop (2); Gong, Yulan (3); Shen, Yu (1); Sun, Lele (1); Zhu, Xinkun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang; 790-784, Korea, Republic of (3) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",MTARCE,537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 541.2 Aluminum Alloys - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Aluminum alloys - Binary alloys - Mechanical properties - Microstructure - Rolling - Strain - Strain hardening - Torsional stress,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Xinkun(xk_zhu@hotmail.com) ",10.2320/matertrans.MA201579,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,13459678,10,2015,English,Copper alloys,,44.0,1658-1663,,2015,Japan Institute of Metals (JIM),Materials Transactions,,Strain softening induced by high pressure torsion in copper alloys,,Cu alloy - Cu-Al alloys - Deformation process - Deformed metals - High pressure torsions - Properties and microstructures - Stacking fault energies - Strain-softening,56,

Innovative Food Sci. Emerg. Technol.,"The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) based biodegradable film packaging combining 0.5% nisin antimicrobial polypeptide on the physicochemical and microbial quality of Boletus edulis wild edible mushrooms stored at 4 ± 1 °C. The experiment was set up by packaging mushrooms with extruded PLA films containing 0, 7.5, and 15 wt.% triethyl citrate plasticizer. The low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film was used as the control. Mushrooms stored in PLA films containing 7.5 and 15 wt.% plasticizer provided better retention of quality characteristics and received higher sensory ratings compared to mushrooms stored in pure PLA film and LDPE film. Samples with these two treatments underwent minimal changes in texture, PPO activity, total bacteria count, and sensory attributes. Results suggest that nisin in combination with plasticized PLA film has the potential to maintain B. edulis wild edible mushroom quality and extend its postharvest life to 18 days. Industrial relevance B. edulis is one of the most commercialized mushrooms worldwide. However, as with all fresh mushrooms, there are severe preservation problems. Extruded PLA films containing triethyl citrate plasticizer plus antimicrobial agent nisin proved to be a suitable technology for mushroom conservation. This material exhibits an environmental-friendliness potential and a high versatility in food packaging. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152100861492,,"Han, Linlei (1); Qin, Yuyue (2); Liu, Dong (1); Chen, Haiyun (1); Li, Hongli (1); Yuan, Minglong (1) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Biopolymer Functional Materials of Yunnan, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Institute of Yunnan Food Safety, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",,"461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 461.9 Biology - 694.1 Packaging, General - 694.4 Storage - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 817.1 Polymer Products - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control",,,,,Antibiotics - Antimicrobial agents - Food storage - Fungi - Lactic acid - Microorganisms - Packaging - Plasticizers - Reinforced plastics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yuan, Minglong(yml@188.com) ",10.1016/j.ifset.2015.04.008,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FA039, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan; Number: 2014YJY87, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31160198, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31360417, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31460247, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2010CI119, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 31160198 , 31360417 , 31460247 ), the Graduate Student Innovation Fund Program of Yunnan Minzu University ( 2014YJY87 ), the Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan ( 2013FA039 ), and the High-End Technology Professionals Introduction Plan in Yunnan province ( 2010CI119 ).",,14668564,,"May 1, 2015",English,Quality control,,42.0,288-294,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies,,Evaluation of biodegradable film packaging to improve the shelf-life of Boletus edulis wild edible mushrooms,,Boletus edulis - Microbial quality - Physico-chemical quality - Poly lactic acid films - Water vapor permeability,29,

Vacuum,"Vacuum decomposition process of molybdenite concentrate was investigated under pressure of 5-35 Pa for 15-120 min at the temperature range 1473 K-1973 K. The theoretical and experimental results showed that Gibbs free energy of vacuum decomposition reactions and evaporation rate of pure sulfur provided the theoretical calculation basis for temperature and heat preservation time selection in vacuum decomposition experiments of molybdenite concentrate. Melting points and saturated vapor pressures of pure substances and compounds predicted the evaporation behavior of impurity elements and its compounds during the experimental process. Both Cu and Fe could partly evaporate into condensate and Cu had better evaporation ability than Fe. MoO3could easily and Al2O3, SiO2could partly evaporate into the condensate. Kilo-scale experiment was performed based on the small experiments and its results showed that the Mo content of molybdenum metal product was 92.38% and the S content of sulfur product was 96.28%, and the molybdenum recovery rate reached to 95.94%.

Phys B Condens Matter,"This paper presents the inverse magnetocaloric effect associated with martensitic transformation in a polycrystalline Ni50Co2Mn33In15alloy. Through the structural measurements, it is found that the bulk sample have a well-developed preferred orientation. The isothermal entropy change (ΔST) has been calculated by changes of volume fractions at certain temperature based on Clausius-Clapeyron equation for different magnetic fields. The maximum ΔSTof Ni50Co2Mn33In15reaches 21.5 J/kg K and keeps in the relative broad temperature range, leading to a great refrigerant capacity under a moderate magnetic field.

Appl. Energy,"A novel magnetic carbonaceous acid catalyst was synthesized from glucose and iron chloride by a new method of double hydrothermal precipitation at 180°C and pyrolysis at 400-800°C, and subsequent sulfonation at 150°C. Its crystalline phases, magnetic saturation (Ms), morphology, specific surface area, pore volume, functional groups, thermal stability, elemental composition and total acid density were analyzed with various techniques. It was found that catalyst carbonized at 600°C (AC-600-SO3H@Fe/C) had high acid density (2.79 mmol/g) and strong magnetism (Ms: 14.4 Am2/kg) for direct production of biodiesel from Jatropha oil with high acid value (17.2 mg KOH/g) by single-factor optimization. With the catalyst, 90.5% biodiesel yield was achieved at 200°C with 3 cycles (>90% yield) and 96.3% catalyst recovery rate. The magnetic catalyst directly esterified and transesterified high acid value oil without pretreatment with high biodiesel yield and easily separated for three recycles with little deactivation. It could also find other applications such as pretreatment of oils with high AV and hydrolysis of biomass. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152701006607,,"Zhang, Fan (1, 2); Fang, Zhen (1); Wang, Yi-Tong (1, 2) ","(1) Chinese Academy of Sciences, Biomass Group, Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, 88 Xuefulu, Kunming, Yunnan Province; 650223, China (2) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing; 100049, China ",APENDX,523 Liquid Fuels - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Biodiesel - Catalysts - Chlorine compounds - Iron compounds - Potassium hydroxide - Sulfonation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fang, Zhen(zhenfang@xtbg.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.044,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: JSU, Sponsor: Jiangsu University; Number: YZ201260, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: XTBG-T02, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 31400518, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; ","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support from Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS 135 program (XTBG-T02) and equipment R&D grant (No. YZ201260)], the Yunnan Provincial Government (Baiming Haiwai Gaocengci Rencai Jihua), and the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31400518).

Appl Surf Sci,"The hydroxylated PVC (PVC-OH) was successfully synthesized by a suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride (VC), butyl acrylate (BA) and hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA). Novel hydrophobic CaCO3 was then prepared by a urethane formation reaction between methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and the -OH groups both in the PVC-OH chains and on the surface of pristine CaCO3 particles. The effect of the PVC-OH content on the grafting ratio of treated CaCO3 particles was extensively investigated. Combining the result of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) with that of water contact angle, it can be concluded that the hydrophobicity of CaCO3 had been efficiently improved by the PVC-OH segments grafted on the surface of CaCO3 particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravity analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were also used to study crystalline behaviors, thermal stability and surface morphology of the modified CaCO3 particles, respectively.

Biomed. Signal Process. Control,"Abstract A novel quadrature clutter rejection approach based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD), which is an extension of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to multivariate for processing multichannel signals, is proposed in this paper to suppress the quadrature clutter signals induced by the vascular wall and the surrounding stationary or slowly moving tissues in composite Doppler ultrasound signals, and extract more blood flow components with low velocities. In this approach, the MEMD algorithms, which include the bivariate empirical mode decomposition with a nonuniform sampling scheme for adaptive selection of projection directions (NS-BEMD) and the trivariate empirical mode decomposition with noise assistance (NA-TEMD), are directly employed to adaptively decompose the complex-valued quadrature composite signals echoed from both bidirectional blood flow and moving wall into a small number of zero-mean rotation components, which are defined as complex intrinsic mode functions (CIMFs). Then the relevant CIMFs contributed to blood flow components are automatically distinguished in terms of the break of the CIMFs' power, and then directly added up to give the quadrature blood flow signal. Specific simulation and human subject experiments are taken up to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of this novel method for quadrature clutter rejection in bidirectional Doppler ultrasound signals. Due to eliminating the extra errors induced by the Hilbert transform or complex FIR filter algorithms used in the traditional clutter rejection approaches based on the directional separation process, the proposed method provides improved accuracy for clutter rejection, and preserve more slow blood blow components, which could be helpful to early diagnose arterial diseases. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J Vib Shock,"Through analyzing gearbox vibration signals under varying speed conditions of rotating machinery, a method of analyzing gear fault based on narrowband demodulation with frequency shift and spectrum edit was proposed. A time-domain signal was sampled under varying speed condition of gearbox and resampled at constant angle increments with the help of order tracking. The signal was thus converted into a stationary signal in the angle-domain, which can overcome the frequency blur caused by rotating speed fluctuation. Then, the angle-domain signal was processed by signal synchronous average in order to weaken the frequency components irrelevant to speed and to improve the signal to noise ratio. The averaged signal was demodulated and after seperating the main meshing order components of the gear fault from the automatically edited order spectrum, the signal was recovered to the angle-domain signal which was further processed by using amplitude and phase demodulation based on the frequency shift. The fault features of gear were finally extracted in accordance with the demodulated waveform diagrams. The simulations and tests were conducted respectively to verify the validity of the proposed method. ©, 2015, Chinese Vibration Engineering Society.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Inf. Autom., ICIA - conjunction IEEE Int. Conf. Autom. Logist.","Sound comfort becomes more and more important in residential houses. Home appliance is one of the main sources of indoor noise. Noise emission is a distinctive feature for the selection of the home appliances. Noise levels in household appliances are increasingly attracting attention from manufacturers and customers. Refrigerators as common appliances used by most families run continuously all day. It produces a lot of noises. National standards have published severe rules on the acceptable noise levels, and noise-free operation becomes the preferred choice of customers in the refrigerators choosing. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the noise level of refrigerator. In this paper, the noise control study has been carried on a type of air-cooled household refrigerator. The noise level of the refrigerator was tested under different operation conditions at first. Then the maximum sound pressure level and noise characters were obtained by analyse the spectra of the noises. Test data shown that the refrigerator noises are mainly composed of compressor and fan noises. According to the characteristics of the compressor and fan noise, a method of using sound insulation board was proposed to reduce the compressor noise. Considering the actual installation restrictions and the compressor cooling demand, a kind of sound insulation board with holes was applied. Experimental studies indicated that the proposed noise control method can suppress the noise of the household refrigerator effectively. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161102092952,7279268,"Guo, Jin-Long (1); Luo, Jian (2); Guo, Yu (1); Pan, Xiao-Yong (2); Fang, Xin (2); Wu, Xing (1) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Sichuan ChangHong Electronics Technology Co.Ltd., Chengdu, Sichuan; 610012, China ",,"413.3 Sound Insulating Materials - 618.1 Compressors - 644.3 Refrigeration Equipment and Components - 731 Automatic Control Principles and Applications - 751 Acoustics, Noise.

Autom Constr,"Construction quality control of storehouse surfaces is a major concern in the construction management of roller-compacted concrete (RCC) dams. The construction quality of the special dam-filling material RCC is affected by many factors, including the rolling compaction, concrete temperature and construction climate of storehouse surfaces. Timely collection and comprehensive analysis of construction data from the entire construction process of storehouse surfaces and subsequent feedback to construction operations on site are key issues in the control of construction quality and thus obtain greater attention. Traditional methods of construction quality monitoring, including manual inspections or sampling tests, are labor-intensive and easily lead to indiscoverable and irreparable quality defects. In the present study, a real-time construction quality monitoring method for storehouse surfaces of RCC dams is proposed. The auto-identification of compacted layers is realized. Based on the integration of global positioning system (GPS) and global navigation satellite system (GLONASS) techniques, sensor technology and network transmission technology, a real-time construction quality monitoring system is developed and applied to the LDL dam as a case study. The application results realize the whole process, all-weather and timely monitoring of rolling compaction quality, concrete temperature and construction climate in each compacted layer of storehouse surfaces and guarantees satisfactory construction quality and high efficiency, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this system. Moreover, construction data are used to establish predictive models for compactness and the loss of vibrating-compacted (VC) value by applying a multiple regression analysis method. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Then we introduce this relationship into conventional strength reduction FEM, and propose strength parameters non-proportional associated reduction FEM. Then strength parameters non-proportional associated reduction FEM based on field variable is realized by using finite element software ABAQUS, thus the efficiency of calculation is improved in the determination of double safety factors. In order to evaluate the slope stability, comprehensive safety factor is proposed. The safety factor is based on shear strength parameters contributing to the resistant shear force. Finally, combined with an example and the comparative analysis of the position of slip surface and the comprehensive safety factor in three kinds of different reduction ways, the rationality and reliability of the method was verified. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

J. Geochem. Explor.,"Metal-element association halos within mineralization-related fault zones (MEAHFZ) and their geochemical characteristics are examined as prospective targets to explore for concealed ore-bodies at the Qilinchang deposit, Huize Zn-Pb-(Ag-Ge) district, located in the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Triangular area of poly-metallic Zn-Pb deposits in southwestern China. By detailed study of the geochemical anomalies, concealed ore-bodies have been successfully found within the MEAHFZ, leading to a 2. million. ton (Mt) increase in the Zn-Pb metal reserves. The successful exploration in the Huize district demonstrates that the MEAHFZ prospecting method has the potential to increase metal reserves in the brown field and to find new deposits in green field or new ore-bodies surrounding areas of the mine area. Variations of gradient value for primary anomalies, controlled by structures, may predict the dipping direction and the extension of the concealed ore-bodies. Also, the shifting direction of anomalies at different levels reflects the dip direction of concealed ore-bodies at depth. Thus, this method can not only find concealed ore-bodies, but also provide important information about deposit genesis. The method is low cost and its operation is simple, and can be used in exploration for concealed ore-bodies at depth in areas such as the Zn-Pb deposits in Northeastern Yunnan, the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Triangular area of poly-metallic Zn-Pb mineralization and the other similar areas over the world where the ores are obviously controlled by structures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",,,20153801295388,,"Han, Run-Sheng (1); Chen, Jin (2); Wang, Feng (2); Wang, Xue-Kun (1); Li, Yuan (1) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Southwest Institute of Geological Survey, Geological Survey Center for Non-ferrous Mineral Resources, Yunnan, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Yunnan Chihong Zn andPb Co.

J Alloys Compd,"Abstract Antiperovskite Mn3Ni(Cu)N thin films with different Cu content were prepared on Si substrate by reactive magnetron sputtering. The effects of Cu addition on the crystal structure, surface morphology and magnetic property of Mn3Ni(Cu)N thin films were investigated. As a result, the preferred orientation is independent to Cu-doping in the Mn3Ni(Cu)N phase, while the addition of Cu induces the lattice expansion for the films, indicating the possibility of controlling the crystal orientation and the substitution of Cu for Ni. Correspondingly, the surface morphologies significantly vary with the Cu-doping. In particular, it is found that increase in Cu content changes the ground state from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferrimagnetic (FI) phase and the magnetic transition temperature gradually decreases within the testing temperature ranges, which is mainly attributed to the competition between FI and AFM interactions with increasing Cu-doping content.

Colloid Polym. Sci.,"This work aims to improve the antifouling property of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane. The pristine PVDF membrane was treated with alkali solution, and then the [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (DMC) and 2-acrylamide-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid (AMPS) monomers were grafted to yield a polyampholyte membrane surface via radical grafting copolymerization. The structural evolution of the membrane was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra attenuated total reflection spectra (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The surface hydrophilicity of membranes was determined by pure water contact angle. The fouling resistance of the membranes was evaluated via protein adsorption and cycle filtration. With the increase of alkali-treatment periods from 0 to 20 min, the grafting degree (GD) of polyampholyte layer increases from 0 to 225.8 μg/cm2, and the membrane surface pores are gradually covered with grafting layers. The hydrophilicity of PVDF membrane was significantly enhanced by the covalent immobilization of polyampholyte layer, resulting in inhibition of protein adsorption. The pure water flux recovery (FRR) of the polyampholyte membrane is much higher than that of the pristine PVDF membrane. Irreversible membrane fouling is gradually transmitted into reversible membrane fouling in the filtration process. The polyampholyte membrane exhibits a better protein fouling resistance than pristine PVDF membrane. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20150700511513,,"Shen, Xiang (1, 2); Yin, Xuebin (1, 2); Zhao, Yiping (1, 2); Chen, Li (1, 2) ","(1) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; Yunnan; 655011, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Hollow Fiber Membrane Materials and Processes, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin; 300387, China ",CPMSB6,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Chlorine compounds - Field emission microscopes - Fluorine compounds - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Grafting (chemical) - Hydrophilicity - Membrane fouling - Membranes - Proteins - Scanning electron microscopy - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Li(tjpuchenlis@163.com) ",10.1007/s00396-015-3510-2,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14351536,,,,0303402X,4,"April 1, 2015",English,Microfiltration,,32.0,1205-1213,,2015,Springer Verlag,Colloid and Polymer Science,,Improved protein fouling resistance of PVDF membrane grafted with the polyampholyte layers,,Antifouling - Attenuated total reflection spectrums - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Fourier transform infrared spectra - Hydrophilic - Poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF) - Polyampholytes - PVDF,293,
J Appl Electrochem,"The effect of quaternary ammonium-based ionic liquids (ILs) including tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulfate (NEt4HSO4) and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (NBu4HSO4) on copper electrodeposition from acidic sulfate electrolyte was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric measurements. These ILs were found to have a blocking effect on the copper electroreduction and induced the formation of more leveled and fine-grained cathodic deposits. Analysis of the dimensionless current–time transients indicated that the electrodeposition of copper was involved with instantaneous three-dimensional nucleation with diffusion-controlled growth. The addition of ILs induced the instantaneous nucleation to more progressive one. Data obtained from X-ray diffraction spectra revealed that the presence of these ILs strongly affected the crystallographic orientation of the electrodeposited copper with a (220) preferential orientation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,20144500152658,,"Zhang, Qibo (1, 2); Yu, Xiaolv (1, 2); Hua, Yixin (1, 2); Xue, Wei (3) ","(1) Key Lab of Ionic Liquids Metallurgy, Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) State Key Lab of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Network and Continuing Education, Yunnan Open University, Kunming; 650223, China ",JAELBJ,539.3.1 Electroplating - 544.1 Copper - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth,,,,,Adsorption - Copper - Copper deposits - Cyclic voltammetry - Electrodeposition - Electrodes - Electrolytes - Electrolytic reduction - Ionic liquids - Nucleation - Sulfur compounds - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Qibo ",10.1007/s10800-014-0774-z,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15728838,,,,0021891X,1,2015,English,Copper compounds,,31.0,79-86,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Journal of Applied Electrochemistry,,The effect of quaternary ammonium-based ionic liquids on copper electrodeposition from acidic sulfate electrolyte,,Copper electrodeposition - Crystallographic orientations - Diffusion controlled growth - Instantaneous nucleations - Nucleation and growth - Quaternary ammonium-based ionic liquids - Tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate - X-ray diffraction spectrum,45,

J. Southeast Univ. Engl. Ed.,"A novel spatial interpolation method based on integrated radial basis function artificial neural networks (IRBFANNs) is proposed to provide accurate and stable predictions of heavy metals concentrations in soil at un-sampled sites in a mountain region. The IRBFANNs hybridize the advantages of the artificial neural networks and the neural networks integration approach. Three experimental projects under different sampling densities are carried out to study the performance of the proposed IRBFANNs-based interpolation method. This novel method is compared with six peer spatial interpolation methods based on the root mean square error and visual evaluation of the distribution maps of Mn elements. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better in accuracy and stability. Moreover, the proposed method can provide more details in the spatial distribution maps than the compared interpolation methods in the cases of sparse sampling density. ©, 2015, Southeast University.

Sci. China Earth Sci.,"To study the effect of different deformation mechanisms on the chemical structure of anthracite coals and further understand the correlation between changed chemical structures and coal and gas outburst, ten groups of sub-high-temperature and sub-high-pressure deformation experiments were performed. All samples maintained primary structure, which were collected from the Qudi Mine in the southern Qinshui Basin of China. The samples were analyzed by ultimate analysis, Vitrinite Reflection (VR), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy both before and after deformation experiments for contrasting. The results showed that the VR values of all samples after experiments were significantly higher than before experiments, which suggested that the metamorphism degree of anthracite coals was increased by deformation. The results also indicated that both temperature and strain rate had significant effects on the chemical structure of anthracite coals. At a high strain rate of 4×10−5s−1, the deformation of the samples was mainly brittle in which the mechanical energy was transformed mainly into frictional energy. In this situation, all samples developed several distinct fractured surfaces and the change of chemical structures was not obvious. On the contrary, with the decrease of the strain rates, the ductile deformation was dominated and the mechanical energy was mainly transformed into strain energy, resulting in the accumulation of deformation energy confessed by increasing quantity of dislocation and creep in the coal’s interior nucleus. The absorption in the aromatic ring groups increased; otherwise the absorption in the aliphatic structures and ether oxygen groups decreased rapidly. During these experiments, CO was collected from two experimental samples. The number of aromatic rings and the structure defects within the two generated gas samples increased and the degree of molecular structure orders decreased. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20151400699224,,"Xu, RongTing (1); Li, HuiJun (1, 2); Hou, QuanLin (1); Li, XiaoShi (1); Yu, LiYe (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Computational Geodynamics, College of Earth Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (2) Yunnan Copper Sanmu Mining Industry Co., Ld., Kunming; 650000, China ",,524 Solid Fuels - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.1 Mechanics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Anthracite - Aromatic compounds - Coal research - Creep - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - High pressure effects - Particles (particulate matter) - Strain energy - Structure (composition) - Surface defects,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hou, QuanLin(quhou@ucas.ac.cn) ",10.1007/s11430-014-4998-x,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18691897,,,,16747313,4,"April 1, 2015",English,Strain rate,,38.0,502-509,,2015,Science in China Press,Science China Earth Sciences,,The effect of different deformation mechanisms on the chemical structure of anthracite coals,,Aliphatic structures - Coal and gas outburst - Deformation mechanism - Ductile deformations - Mechanical energies - Secondary structures - Southern qinshui basins - Vitrinites,58,

Econ. Geol.,"The Beiya skarn gold deposit is located in the eastern Tethyan orogenic belt in western Yunnan province, China. It is one of the largest gold deposits in China, with significant amounts of silver and base metals. To the end of 2014, the estimated resources are 125 million tonnes (Mt) of ore, grading 2.42 g/t Au, 0.48 wt % Cu, 25.5 wt % Fe, 38.85 g/t Ag, 1.24 wt % Pb, and 0.53 wt % Zn. Skarn alteration and mineralization are related to shoshonitic quartz monzonite porphyries that were emplaced in Triassic carbonates (Beiya Formation). Re-Os dating on molybdenite from a skarn orebody indicates an ore-forming age of 36.82 ± 0.48 Ma, which is consistent with previous dating results of the quartz monzonite porphyries. At least two paragenetic stages of skarn minerals and associated sulfides were recognized, with the early stage typified by garnet ± pyroxene, magnetite, and calcite, and the late stage characterized by epidote, amphibole, chlorite, quartz, and calcite, containing up to 70% sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, and minor pyrrhotite). The early skarn is dominated by anhydrous minerals, which were replaced by hydrous minerals formed during the late stage. The garnet in the Beiya deposit is andradite rich (Ad36-97Gr3-61), and pyroxene is relatively diopside rich (Di8-91Hd7-89). This mineral assemblage indicates an oxidized skarn system, similar to other Au-Cu, Fe-bearing skarn deposits around the world. Fluid inclusions from pyroxene indicate precipitation from high-temperature and high-to moderate-salinity fluids (420°-530°C, 11.1-43.3 wt % NaCl equiv), which probably results from boiling of a moderately saline magmatic fluid. Cooler (180°-365°C) and moderate-to low-salinity fluids (1.6-16.5 wt % NaCl equiv) were trapped in garnet and quartz and are interpreted to be responsible for gold deposition. Chlorite chemistry indicates ore-forming temperatures between 300° and 340°C, in agreement with fluid inclusion data. It appears that gold was transported as chloride complexes under oxidized conditions and was deposited at temperatures of about 300°C, when transport of chloride complexes as gold carriers was less efficient. © 2015 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.",,,20153201105487,,"He, Wen-Yan (1); Mo, Xuan-Xue (1); He, Zhong-Hua (2); White, Noel C.

Chem. Eng. Process.: Process Intensif.,"Phenol (PhOH) transport from the aqueous solution through a supported liquid membrane (SLM) impregnated with bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfoxide (BESO) in kerosene was investigated. The fundamental parameters influencing PhOH transport, such as pH of the feed solution, stirring speed, carrier concentration, initial PhOH concentration and NaOH concentration in the stripping solution, were determined. The most acceptable for PhOH transport efficiency was observed under the following conditions: stirring speed of 800rpm in both phases, 20% (v/v) BESO in kerosene as carrier, 2.13mmolL-1(200mgL-1) PhOH in pH 2.00 solution and 0.20molL-1NaOH as the stripping solution. Up to 91% of the PhOH in solution was transported from the feed phase to the stripping phase after 12h of transport process at a permeation coefficient of 7.35×10-6ms-1under optimum conditions. A model depicting PhOH transport across the SLM was proposed. Experimental results revealed that the diffusion coefficient of the PhOH complex across the membrane was 6.15×10-11m2s-1and the thickness of the aqueous diffusion layer was calculated to be 7.74×10-5m.

Anal. Methods,"A method to separate and preconcentrate trace levels of chromium using silver nanoparticle (Ag NP) technology and suspension dispersive solid phase extraction is proposed. The synthesized Ag NPs combine with chromium to form aggregations. Suspension dispersive solid phase extraction is based on the reaction of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a zinc hydroxide suspension. The UV-vis absorption spectra and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the aggregation of the Ag NPs. The influence of several parameters, such as volume of silver nitrate, extraction temperature, the solution pH, type and mass of the sorbent, vortex time, equilibration time, Ag NP volume, and the type, concentration and volume of the acid and foreign ions were investigated and optimized. Linearity was investigated from 10 to 1000 μg L-1, and the correlation coefficient was 0.9988. Recoveries of 97.7-103.3% and an enrichment factor of 20 were achieved with 40 mL of sample. The LOD was 3.2 μg L-1for total chromium, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 4.2% at 20 μg L-1.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"The mineral composition of rock is one of the main factors affecting the spectral reflectance characteristics, and it's an important reason for generating various rock characteristic spectra. This study choose the rock samples provided by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) (including all kinds of mineral percentage of rocks, and spectral reflectances range from 0.35 to 2.50 μm wavelength measured by ASD spectrometer), and the various types of mineral spectral reflectances contained within the rocks are the essential data. Using the spectral linear mixture model of rocks and their minerals, firstly, a simulation study on the mixture of rock and mineral composition is achieved, the experimental results indicate that rock spectral curves using the model which based on the theory of the linear mixture are able to simulate better and preserve the absorption characteristics of various mineral components well. Then, 8 samples which contain biotite mineral are picked from the rock spectra of igneous, biotite contents and the absorption depth characteristics of spectral reflection at 2.332 μm, furthermore, a variety of linear and nonlinear normal statistical models are used to fit the relationship between the depth of absorption spectra and the content of the mineral composition of biotite, finally, a new simulation model is build up with the Growth and the Exponential curve model, and a statistical response relationship between the spectral absorption depth and the rock mineral contents is simulated by using the new model, the fitting results show that the correlation coefficient reaches 0.998 4 and the standard deviation is 0.572, although the standard deviation using Growth and Exponential model is less than the two model combined with the new model fitting the standard deviation, the correlation coefficient of the new model had significantly increased, which suggesting that the new model fitting effect is closer to the measured values of samples, it proves that the simulation results of new model is closer to the measured value. © 2015, Science Press.

Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,"With the development of internet, there are billions of short texts generated each day. However, the accuracy of large scale short text classification is poor due to the data sparseness. Traditional methods used to use external dataset to enrich the representation of document and solve the data sparsity problem. But external dataset which matches the specific short texts is hard to find. In this paper, we propose a framework to solve the data sparsity problem without using external dataset. Our framework deal with large scale short text by making the most of semantic similarity of words which learned from the training short texts. First, we learn word distributed representation and measure the word semantic similarity from the training short texts. Then, we propose a method which enrich the document representation by using the word semantic similarity information. At last, we build classifiers based on the enriched representation. We evaluate our framework on both the benchmark dataset(Standford Sentiment Treebank) and the large scale Chinese news title dataset which collected by ourselves. For the benchmark dataset, using our framework can improve 3% classification accuracy. The result we tested on the large scale Chinese news title dataset shows that our framework achieve better result with the increase of the training set size. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20155201718897,7280513,"Yao, Di (1); Bi, Jingping (1); Huang, Jianhui (1); Zhu, Jin (2) ","(1) Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100190, China (2) Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming; 650031, China ",85OFAE,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 912.4 Personnel,116724.0,"July 12, 2015 - July 17, 2015","Killarney, Ireland","International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2015",Personnel training - Semantics - Testing - Text processing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280513,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479919604.0,,,"September 28, 2015",English,Classification (of information),"2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2015",18.0,,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,,A word distributed representation based framework for large-scale short text classification,,Benchmark datasets - Classification accuracy - Data sparsity problems - Distributed representation - Document Representation - Semantic similarity - Semantic similarity of words - Short text classifications,2015-September,
J. Chin. Cereals Oils Assoc.,"In this paper, eight kinds of legume seeds grown in Yunnan have been utilized as materials. Their total flavonoid content, total phenol content and antioxidant activities have been studied by spectrophotometry. The results showed that the content of flavonoids of common bean was up to 0.55%, the total polyphenol content of Lijiang runner beans, Baoshan faba beans and Baoshan horsebeans raised higher to up to 0.25%. The total reducing power of common bean was the strongest in the eight kinds of legume seeds. However, the power of Kunming hyacinth beans was the weakest. The capability of scavenging DPPH· of Jianchuan lima beans was only 52.28%, while that of other beans could be over 69%. Jianchuan lima beans and Lijiang runner beans had a stronger capability of scavenging ·OH radical. The results of correlation analysis showed that no significant correlation between total flavonoid content and the antioxidant activities of those eight kinds of legume seeds was found(P>0.05).No significant correlation between total phenol content and radical-scavenging activity (P>0.05) was also detected. But a highly significant correlation expressed between the total phenol content and the total reducing power (P<0.01). In these eight kinds of legume seeds grown in Yunnan, the phenolic content was rather higher and so was the antioxidant activity.

J. Agric. Food Chem.,"The morphology and chemical profile of the capitate glandular trichomes (CGTs) of Paragutzlaffia henryi (Acanthaceae) were investigated. Four new labdane diterpenoids named paraguhenryisins A-D (1-4), together with the known physacoztomatin (5), were localized to the CGTs using laser microdissection coupled with cryogenic1H NMR and HPLC analyses and were traced and isolated from the CGT extract of inflorescences. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Bioassays indicated significant inhibitory effect for these diterpenoids on Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination and seedling root elongation. The most potent inhibitor, paraguhenryisin C (3), was interestingly detected in both the rhizosphere soil and water rinsed inflorescences extract of P. henryi but not the roots, with average contents in the rhizosphere soil relevant to its phytotoxic EC50values. These results suggested that phytotoxic labdane diterpenoids in the CGTs might be released into the environment as a defensive measure for P. henryi against other competitive plants. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20154801606391,,"Wang, Ying (1, 2); Luo, Shi-Hong (1); Hua, Juan (1, 2); Liu, Yan (1); Jing, Shu-Xi (1); Li, Xiao-Nian (1); Li, Sheng-Hong (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; Yunnan; 650201, China (2) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China ",JAFCAU,483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Essential oils - Single crystals - Soils - Spectroscopic analysis - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Sheng-Hong(shli@mail.kib.ac.cn) ",10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04113,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205118,,,,00218561,45,"October 29, 2015",English,Lipids,,19.0,10004-10012,,2015,American Chemical Society,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,,Capitate Glandular Trichomes of Paragutzlaffia henryi Harbor New Phytotoxic Labdane Diterpenoids,,Arabidopsis thaliana - capitate glandular trichomes - Diterpenoids - Laser micro dissections - Paragutzlaffia henryi - Phytotoxic activity - Single crystal x-ray diffraction - Spectroscopic method,63,
Chem. Asian J.,"A highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (H7N9 AIV) detection was proposed by using electrochemical magnetoimmunoassay coupled with biometallization and anodic stripping voltammetry. This strategy could accumulate the enzyme-generated product on the surface of the magneto electrode by means of silver deposition, which amplified the detection signal about 80 times. The use of magnetic beads (MBs) and the magneto electrode could also amplify the detection signal. Furthermore, a bi-electrode signal transduction system was introduced into this immunosensor, which is also beneficial to the immunoassay. A concentration as low as 0.011 ng-mL-1of H7N9 AIV could be detected in about 1.5 h with good specificity. This study not only provides a simple and sensitive approach for virus detection but also offers an effective signal enhancement strategy for the development of highly sensitive MB-based electrochemical immunoassays. Virus detector: A simple and highly sensitive biometallization-based electrochemical magnetoimmunosensing strategy based on the integration of electrochemical magnetoimmunosensing, biometallization reaction, and bi-electrode signal transduction system is reported. The biometallization strategy could enhance the electrochemical signals about 80 times.

Mater. Res. Innov.,"In this study, the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties during continuous annealing for the copper bonding wire containing trace Mg and Ag were investigated. The relationship of microstructure evolution about recovery, recrystallisation and grain growth with breaking strength, hardness and elongation was analysed under different annealing temperatures for the studied copper wire with an area reduction of 99?95%. The results showed that the recovery occurred during annealing at 300-3508C, accompanying that breaking strength and hardness decreased, and elongation increased progressively. The recrystallisation happened during annealing at 350-4608C, and it accompanied that the breaking strength and hardness decreased, and elongation increased rapidly. The cold-drawn fibrous microstructure transformed into the recrystallised equiaxed grain. Annealing over 4608C caused the recrystallised grain growth and accompanying that breaking strength and hardness decreased, and elongation increased slowly. The proper combination of breaking strength and elongation was obtained by optimising continuous annealing during recrystallisation. Their results suggested that the high performance of copper bonding wire for semiconductor packaging can be developed by microstructure control through a proper continuous annealing. © W. S.

To tackle road safety problems, the Chinese central government set a national road safety target, requiring each local government above the county level to make its own target. The purpose of this paper is to propose a road safety forecasting model which can be used in local road safety target setting. Through discussing the needs of road safety forecasting for target setting, the error correction model (ECM) is built based on time series theory. In the model, the input variable is gross domestic product (GDP) and the output variable is road death rate.

Sci. China Technol. Sci.,"For a variable speed large scale wind turbine, the vibration issues become a key problem that cannot be ignored in the turbine’s life cycle. Wind turbine tower vibration will cause superfluous mechanical loads. To resolve the vibration issue, a method for constructing the energy function V is proposed to meet the demands of safe operation. The Lyapunov theorem has been embedded in a wind turbine control algorithm, proving the theoretical feasibility of stability control based on function V. According to an analysis of this complex nonlinear model for the wind turbine, the general method of constructing an energy function suitable for a wind turbine is presented explicitly. The feasibility of applying an energy function to wind turbine vibration control is verified experimentally using a 3.0-MW direct drive wind turbine model. The experimental results indicate that the dynamic performance of the tested wind turbine model with energy function control is significantly better than that of the uncontrolled structure in terms of the reduction of nacelle acceleration, velocity, and displacement response. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20152500950104,,"Deng, Ying (1); Gao, Jie (1); Tian, De (2); Zhou, Feng (1); Gao, Shang (1); Zhao, Ming (3) ","(1) Institute of Renewable Energy, North China Electrical Power University, Beijing; 102206, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources (NCEPU), Beijing; 102206, China (3) Yunnan Electric Power Grid Co., Power Research Institute, Kunming; 650217, China ",,"408 Structural Design - 615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 731.3 Specific Variables Control - 961 Systems Science",,,,,Life cycle - Lyapunov methods - Structural dynamics - Vibration analysis - Vibration control - Wind power,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gao, Jie(windpower_gaojie@163.com) ",10.1007/s11431-015-5856-6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1862281X,,,,16747321,7,"July 29, 2015",English,Wind turbines,,19.0,1186-1195,,2015,Springer Verlag,Science China Technological Sciences,,Controlling structural vibrations in wind turbines by constructing function V,,Direct-drive wind turbines - Displacement response - Large scale wind turbines - Lyapunov theorems - Stability analysis - Structural vibrations - Wind turbine control - Wind turbine modeling,58,
RSC Adv.,"Tubular halloysite minerals are used as support for the fabrication of one-dimensional polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite composite nanotubes in the presence of different acid dopant at low temperature. By simply adjusting the acidity of the reaction system, PANI-crystalline TiO2-HA composite nanotubes composed of anatase, a mixed phase TiO2and different PANI redox state are obtained. The acidity of reaction system is tuned by HNO3, HCl, H2SO4and H3PO4, respectively. The traditional thermal treatment for crystalline transformation is not required, thus intact halloysite structure can be guaranteed. The XRD and UV-vis results show that the surface polyaniline sensitization has no effect on the crystalline structure of halloysite and the light response of TiO2is extended to visible-light regions, respectively. The visible light photocatalytic activity of polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite with HCl tuning the acidity (pH 0.5) and 1% volume ratio of aniline to titanium isopropoxide in the preparation (P-TH/0.5/1%-HCl) is superior to those of samples with H2SO4, HNO3and H3PO4tuning the acidity in the preparation at the same acidity and volume ratio of aniline to titanium isopropoxide. Such superior photocatalytic activity of P-TH/0.5/1%-HCl is mainly due to the enhanced visible light adsorption and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, redoping P-TH/0.5/1%-HCl with H2SO4and H3PO4demonstrates its photocatalytic activity decreases, indicating the acid dopants in the preparation and redoping process play a important role to the photocatalytic activity of the polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite composite nanotubes. Moreover, the supported catalyst allows them to be easily separated from the solution. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20154901635005,,"Li, Cuiping (1); Zhou, Tianzhu (1); Zhu, Tianwen (1); Li, Xueyuan (1) ","(1) Department of Applied Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource, Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,482.2 Minerals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 708.2 Conducting Materials - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 819.4 Fiber Products - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Aniline - Complexation - Crystalline materials - Doping (additives) - Kaolinite - Light - Nanotubes - Photocatalysis - Polyaniline - Temperature - Titanium dioxide - Tuning - Yarn,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Cuiping(licp830@iccas.ac.cn) ",10.1039/c5ra20024e,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,119,2015,English,Chlorine compounds,,39.0,98482-98491,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity of polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite composite nanotubes by tuning the acid dopant in the preparation,,Composite nanotubes - Crystalline structure - Crystalline transformation - Electrical conductivity - Photocatalytic activities - Titanium Isopropoxide - Visible light photocatalytic activity - Visible light region,5,

IEEE Veh Technol Conf,"A novel printed compact triple-band antenna for WLAN/WiMAX applications is proposed in this paper. Due to the coupling between the 'comb' shape parasitic element and the multi-branch radiating element, three frequency bands which are suitable for WLAN/WiMAX are achieved. The simulated results show that by adding the parasitic element, the high frequency end cutoff frequency of the antenna is reduced from 6.89 GHz to 6.0 GHz and a notched band at 3.84-5.02GHz is produced. The overall dimension of the proposed antenna can reach 29291.6 mm3. The measured results show that the antenna's working frequency bands of S11-10 dB are as follows: 2.29-2.90GHz, 3.30-3.93 GHz and 4.92-6.0 GHz, which well cover both the WLAN (2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz) and WiMAX (2.3/2.5/3.5/5.8 GHz) frequency bands.

Chemosphere,"A novel two-layer heterotrophic-autotrophic denitrification (HAD) permeable reactive barrier (PRB) was proposed for remediating nitrate-nitrogen contaminated groundwater in an oxygen rich environment, which has a packing structure of an upstream pine bark layer and a downstream spongy iron and river sand mixture layer. The HAD PRB involves biological deoxygenation, heterotrophic denitrification, hydrogenotrophic denitrification, and anaerobic Fe corrosion. Column and batch experiments were performed to: (1) investigate the NO3--N removal and inorganic geochemistry; (2) explore the nitrogen transformation and removal mechanisms; (3) identify the hydrogenotrophic denitrification capacity; and (4) evaluate the HAD performance by comparison with other approaches. The results showed that the HAD PRB could maintain constant high NO3--N removal efficiency (>91%) before 38 pore volumes (PVs) of operation (corresponding to 504d), form little or even negative NO2--N during the 45 PVs, and produce low NH4+-N after 10 PVs. Aerobic heterotrophic bacteria played a dominant role in oxygen depletion via aerobic respiration, providing more CO2for hydrogenotrophic denitrification. The HAD PRB significantly relied on heterotrophic denitrification. Hydrogenotrophic denitrification removed 10-20% of the initial NO3--N. Effluent total organic carbon decreased from 403.44mgL-1at PV 1 to 9.34mgL-1at PV 45.

Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am.,"Five moderate-sized earthquakes struck the Yingjiang area (China-Myanmar border), where there is a lack of historical earthquakes, and provided us an opportunity to study the seismogenic fault. We relocate sequences via the hypoDD method using the cross-correlated arrival times. The phase picking errors by the human analysts had only 0.01 s difference before and after 2009; however, the P-phase picking precision increased from the tenths to the hundredths place after 2009, and the relocation errors of hypoDD simultaneously decreased by a factor of 2. The rupture dimensions are about 2-4 km for the five sequences. The hypoDD relocation errors are only 0.36 or 0.63 km for the two test clusters, which are much smaller than the dimensions of the rupture areas. The synthetic tests show no location bias from the distribution of the Yunnan regional seismic network. The relocations identify four linear features with the northwest, north-northwest, or northeast direction for the 21 March 2008, 3 September 2008, 10 March 2011, and 30 May 2014 sequences orthogonal to the known major fault traces. The relocations also suggest that the 10 March 2011 sequence is on a double-layered fault dipping roughly 71° to the southwest.

Knowl Based Syst,"In order to represent hierarchical structure of data measured at different levels of granularities, the notion of multi-scale information table has been developed from the perspective of granular computation. In the present study, we mainly address the issue of rule induction in multi-scale decision tables. By considering independently three different types of complete multi-scale decision tables, we propose a local approach to rule induction. Compared with the existing literature, the selection of the optical level of scale and attribute reduction are both performed in a pointwise manner instead of the global one. Precisely speaking, the optical level of scale of any element relative to the decision attribute is firstly defined, then by removing superfluous attribute-value pairs in each decision rule, a set of simplified rules is derived. Lastly, a rule reduction is defined and the final set of decision rules is thus obtained. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J. Opt.,"In this paper, a flat-topped vortex hollow beam, which is a new mathematical model for dark hollow beams, has been introduced. The propagation properties of a flat-topped vortex hollow beam of circular and elliptical symmetry are investigated. According to the Collins formula under paraxial conditions, analytical formulas of the average intensity and the effective beam radius of a flat-topped vortex hollow beam are derived. Compared with a general flat-topped hollow beam by using numerical simulation, the propagation characteristics of a flat-topped vortex hollow beam are studied in detail. The relationships between the effective beam radius and propagation distance z are also provided graphically. From the graphical outputs of the receiver plane, it is observed that a flat-topped vortex hollow beam propagating to the far field still maintains a dark hollow spot and the radius of the dark hollow spot will get gradually larger as the propagation distance is extended. Furthermore, the flat-topped vortex hollow beam carrying the orbital angular momentum can be widely applied in atomic optics. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,20152801021220,075606,"Liu, Huilong (1, 2); Lü, Yanfei (1, 2); Xia, Jing (1, 2); Pu, Xiaoyun (1); Zhang, Li (1, 2) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Astronomy, Yunnan University, Key Laboratory of Astroparticle Physics of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions",,,,,Laser beams,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1088/2040-8978/17/7/075606,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20408986,,,,20408978,7,"July 1, 2015",English,Vortex flow,,42.0,,,2015,Institute of Physics Publishing,Journal of Optics (United Kingdom),,Flat-topped vortex hollow beam and its propagation properties,,Effective beams - Hollow beams - Laser beam transmission - New mathematical model - Orbital angular momentum - Propagation characteristics - Propagation distances - Propagation properties,17,
Propellants Explos Pyrotech,"Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) is currently one of the most widely used explosives. 1,3,5,7-Tetraacetyl-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (TAT) is an attractive precursor for the synthesis of HMX; the nitration of this key precursor results in both high yield and purity under mild condition. TAT can be prepared either by acetylation of 2,6-diacetyl-pentamethylenetetramine (DAPT) or by the condensation of ACN and 1,3,5-trioxane. However, TAT and DAPT are polar compounds, and are difficult to analyze using reverse phase liquid chromatography. Herein, a chromatography method for the direct separation of these polar compounds was developed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) using a Venusil HILIC column, with ACN/water (95/5, v/v) as the mobile phase. The chromatographic analysis and identification of these polar compounds provide valuable information for the optimization of the synthetic process of TAT. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Gaodianya Jishu,"We proposed a communication network architecture and its implementation scheme which are suitable for things of internet (IOT) to adapt on-line monitoring and equipment assets management of power transmission and its distribution equipment. The flat mesh framework supports the decentralization of information collection points in Field Area Network and distributed processing between processors. By introducing the function entity of convergence layer, the scheme realizes the management and control of IOT communication equipment and communication flow when the double-channel heterogeneous networking framework of wired network and wireless network was designed to enhance the fault-tolerant capability of the system in the field implementation scheme. The function and performance of the IEC61850-based communication system were measured. The test shows that, in the broadcast storm scene, the traditional network almost collapses; however, in the new network structure presented in this paper, the network delay under the maximum of 87.93 ms reveals that, based on the communication network architecture, the performance of network and its fault-tolerant capability are effectively guaranteed compared with traditional network on the premise of meeting the latency and bandwidth requirements proposed in IEC61850 standard.

Carbohydr Polym,"Cellulose crystals, including microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC), were used as the fillers to prepare green composites with poly(β-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) by melt mixing for crystallization study. The results reveal that the spherulite morphology of PHB and its composites depends highly on the crystallization temperature, evolving from bundle shaped to ring-banded and finally to irregular or zigzag textures with increase of temperature. However, the ring-banded structure is strongly affected by the presence of cellulose crystals, and the average band space decreases evidently with the addition of MCC or NCC. Compared with PHB/MCC composite, PHB/NCC composite shows degraded spherulite structure with smaller band space and higher flocculation level of peak-to-valley height because of stronger unbalanced stresses in this system. Besides, cellulose crystals can act as good heterogeneous nucleating agent to accelerate the crystallization of PHB, which is further confirmed by the polarized optical microscopy observations and the kinetic analyses. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Int. J. Climatol.,"Southwest China has experienced significant drought during the past few years. To better understand the tendency of drought changes over time, this study applies dendroclimatological techniques to assess drought variations in Lijiang Prefecture, southwest China. So far, the longest chronology (387 years) of Picea likiangensis on the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain was constructed, and the relationships between the tree-ring width and climate variables were analysed. The spring season Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) was reconstructed based on a standard chronology. Tree-ring width is positively related to precipitation and relative humidity from February to March and the PDSI from January to May. Conversely, tree-ring width is also negatively related with mean temperature from January to May, suggesting that growth of P. likiangensis is affected both by temperature and precipitation. The reconstructed PDSI showed that the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain has experienced considerable variations in spring drought conditions during the past 361 years. Four distinct periods were recognized: (1) 1650-1730, a relatively humid period with an average PDSI value above zero; (2) 1730-1860, a period with greatly fluctuating PDSI and intermittent wet periods (1746-1755, 1782-1800, and 1820-1830) and several dry periods (1735-1745, 1756-1780, 1810-1820, and 1830-1860); (3) 1870-1945, a humid period, with the highest PDSI value during 1930-1945; and (4) 1945-2011, a period with decreasing humidity. The results are consistent with hydrological studies in nearby regions and related species, as well as historical records of natural disasters. The recently observed spring drought follows a trend of decreasing humidity over the past 60 years, suggesting that a sound strategy for management and land-use planning is required to secure ecosystem and human well-being. © 2015 Royal Meteorological Society.",,,20160701953820,,"Bi, Yingfeng (1, 2, 3, 4); Xu, Jianchu (1, 2, 4, 5); Gebrekirstos, Aster (6); Guo, Liang (2, 3, 4); Zhao, Mingxu (2, 3, 4); Liang, Eryuan (7); Yang, Xuefei (1, 2, 4) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Plant Diversity and Biogeography of East Asia, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China (2) Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (4) Yunnan Key Laboratory for Wild Plant Resources, Kunming, China (5) World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), East and Central Asia, Kunming, China (6) World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), United Nations Avenue, Nairobi, Kenya (7) Key Laboratory of Tibetan Environment Changes and Land Surface Processes, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China ",IJCLEU,403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 443.3 Precipitation - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals,,,,,Disasters - Forestry - Land use - Landforms - Silicate minerals - Snow,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Xuefei(xuefei@mail.kib.ac.cn) ",10.1002/joc.4264,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10970088,,,,08998418,14,"November 30, 2015",English,Drought,,53.0,4057-4065,,2015,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, United Kingdom",International Journal of Climatology,,"Assessing drought variability since 1650 AD from tree-rings on the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, southwest China",,Drought conditions - Hengduan Mountains - Historical records - Palmer drought severity indices - PDSI - Picea likiangensis - Standard chronologies - Tree-ring width,35,

J Supercomput,"Cyber foraging is an important method to enable resource-constrained mobile devices to perform applications in different mobile cloud computing environments to improve performance and to save energy consumption. This paper focuses on the decision problem about how to offload computation-intensive applications in mobile ad hoc network-based cloud computing environments. A set of online and batch scheduling heuristics were proposed to offload dynamically arriving independent tasks among mobile nodes. The heuristics were validated in a simulation environment, and their performances with respect to both user-centric and system-centric metrics such as the average makespan, the average waiting time, the average slowdown and the average utilization, were investigated with comprehensive experiments. Experimental results show that it is not appropriate to map tasks only based on the expected bandwidth, execution time or the overall offloading time, On the contrary, the expected completion time must be taken into account. Furthermore, the MCTComm heuristic seems to be the best choice from the standpoint of the tradeoff between the complexity and the performance. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.",,,20151700781103,A011,"Li, Bo (1); Pei, Yijian (1); Wu, Hao (1); Shen, Bin (2) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan; 430073, China ",JOSUED,"525.3 Energy Utilization - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 912.2 Management",,,,,Energy utilization - Green computing - Mobile ad hoc networks - Mobile telecommunication systems - Scheduling - Scheduling algorithms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Hao(haowu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11227-015-1425-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15730484,,,,09208542,8,"August 1, 2015",English,Mobile cloud computing,,41.0,3009-3036,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Journal of Supercomputing,,Heuristics to allocate high-performance cloudlets for computation offloading in mobile ad hoc clouds,,Average waiting-time - Batch-scheduling - Cloud computing environments - Computation intensives - Computation offloading - Cyber foraging - Online scheduling - Simulation environment,71,

ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,"The development of low-cost and highly active electrocatalysts for two half reactions: H2and O2evolution reactions (HER and OER), isstill a huge challenge to realize water splitting. Herein, we report that CoP nanoparticles (NPs) can act as a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER.

Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol.,"Transformation approach is a useful tool for the study of gene function, the mechanism of molecular regulation, and increase usefulness of components by reverse genetic approach in plants. In this study, we developed a stable and rapid method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of a medicinal plant Chelone glabra L. using leaf explants. Stable transformants were obtained using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains GV2260 and GV3101 that harbored the binary vector pBI121 and contained the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NPT II) as a selectable marker and a reporter gene β-glucuronidase (GUS). Putative transformants were identified by kanamycin selection and a histochemical assay. PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed the integration of the GUS gene into transformed genomes as well as detected stable expression of the β-glucuronidase gene (GUS) by RT-PCR. Resulting transformed plants had morphologically normal phenotypes. This method requires two changes of medium and few leaf explants as well as the transformation efficiency of 2–8 % after 2–3 months of inoculation. This method can provide a quick and economical transformation method for reverse genetic approach to change the secondary metabolic pathway to increase useful components in C. glabra. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20151000612183,,"Gao, Zhenrui (1, 3); Li, Ying (1, 3); Chen, Jinhua (2); Chen, Zhixing (2); Cui, Min-Long (1, 4) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Pollution Ecology and Environmental Engineering, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang; 110016, China (2) Yunnan Academy of Applied Technology, Kunming; 650051, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (4) Institute of Virology and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou; 310021, China ",,461.9 Biology,,,,,Bacteria - Plants (botany),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cui, Min-Long(min-long.cui@iae.ac.cn) ",10.1007/s12010-014-1414-0,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15590291,,,,02732289,5,2015,English,Gene expression,,37.0,2390-2398,,2015,Humana Press Inc.,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,,A Rapid and Stable Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation Method of a Medicinal Plant Chelone glabra L.,,Agrobacterium mediated transformations - Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain - Chelone glabra L - GUS expression - Leaf explants - Neomycin phosphotransferase - Secondary metabolic pathways - Transformation efficiency,175,
Water Resour. Manage.,"Rapid urbanization and population growth have resulted in worldwide serious water shortage and environmental deterioration. It is then essential for efficient and feasible allocation of scarce water and environment resources to the competing users. Due to inherent uncertainties, decision making for resources allocation is vulnerable to failure. The scheme feasibility can be evaluated by reliability, representing the failure probability. A progressive reliability-oriented multi-objective (PROMO) optimal decision-making procedure is proposed in this study to deal with problems with numerous reliability objectives. Dimensionality of the objectives is reduced by a top-down hierarchical reliability analysis (HRA) process combining optimization with evaluation. Pareto solutions of the reformulated model, representing alternative schemes non-dominated with each other, are generated by a metalmodel-based optimization algorithm. Evaluation and identification of Pareto solutions are conducted by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The PROMO procedure is demonstrated for a case study on industrial structure transformation under strict constraints of water resources and total environmental emissions amounts in Guangzhou City, South China. The Pareto front reveals tradeoffs between economic returns of the industries and system reliability. For different reliability preference scenarios, the Pareto solutions are ranked and the top-rated one was recommended for implementation. The model results indicate that the PROMO procedure is effective for model solving and scheme selection of uncertainty-based multi-objective decision making. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",,,20154601557550,,"Dong, Feifei (1); Liu, Yong (1); Su, Han (1); Liang, Zhongyao (1); Zou, Rui (2, 3); Guo, Huaicheng (1) ","(1) College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (MOE), Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Tetra Tech, Inc, 10306 Eaton Place, Ste 340, Fairfax; VA; 22030, United States (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China ",,444 Water Resources - 451.1 Air Pollution Sources - 912.2 Management - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Decision making - Decision theory - Evolutionary algorithms - Hierarchical systems - Industrial emissions - Optimization - Population statistics - Resource allocation - Stochastic programming - Stochastic systems - Uncertainty analysis - Water resources,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Yong(yongliu@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s11269-015-1192-7,Engineering Village,Compendex,Article in Press,15731650,,,,09204741,,"November 12, 2015",English,Reliability analysis,,,,,2015,Springer Netherlands,Water Resources Management,,Uncertainty-Based Multi-Objective Decision Making with Hierarchical Reliability Analysis Under Water Resources and Environmental Constraints,,Environmental deterioration - Hierarchical reliability analysis - Industrial structure transformation - Multi objective decision making - Multi objective evolutionary algorithms - Multi-criteria decision analysis - Trade-off analysis - Water resources allocations,,
Int J Appl Electromagnet Mech,"The operation environment of electric power cables undergoes more and more natural damages, such as earthquake, flood which would result in the change of unit capacitance and inductance of power cables, as well as the reactive power. In this paper, a method of ''distributed model'' based on Poynting vector and space-stepping finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) is proposed to calculate the reactive power of power cables. Comparing with the method of ''lumped model'', it can calculate the reactive power of power cables without computing the unit capacitance and inductance which are difficult to get, especially when the cable trench is fill with ponding, sludge and collapse. Calculation of the reactive power has been carried out in consideration of eccentric and water infiltration cases, and results indicate that ponding environment will lead to a substantial increase of capacitive reactive power. Capacitive reactive power increase with cable eccentricity degree; when cables suffer both water ingress and a 2.5 mm eccentricity degree, the increased capacitive reactive power will reach 51.98%. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

It uses TV model to de-noise and uses Sobel algorithm to control smoothness of the image’ edge. This proposed method will not only efficiently remove image noise but also simultaneously reserves detail information such as edge and texture. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm achieves better SNR and SSIM compared with other methods.

"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf. Trust, Secur. Priv. Comput.

Even the encryptor needs only one encryption operation, and all the decryption operations are distributed to the receiver's end, the computational cost of encryption is still impractical when there is a large amount of encryption with different access structures. In this paper, we examine existing techniques that optimize the decentralized attribute based encryption scheme [3], such as a better construction of e Linear Secret-Sharing Scheme (LSSS) matrix, pre-processing of scalar multiplication and pairing, multi-pairing and so on. We proposed the deployment of offline pools to improve the real-time operations. We proposed the method to construct offline pools and designed algorithms to achieve better hitting rate of offline pool topples. We evaluated the optimization techniques, the result shows that there is a 45 times of performance improvement in the encryption (6-8 times for the decryption) after we applied all the real-time optimization techniques mentioned in our paper.

Astropart. Phys.,"The ARGO-YBJ experiment has been in stable data taking from November 2007 till February 2013 at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Observatory (4300 m a.s.l.). The detector consists of a single layer of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) (6700 m2) operated in streamer mode. The signal pick-up is obtained by means of strips facing one side of the gas volume. The digital readout of the signals, while allows a high space-time resolution in the shower front reconstruction, limits the measurable energy to a few hundred TeV. In order to fully investigate the 1-10 PeV region, an analog readout has been implemented by instrumenting each RPC with two large size electrodes facing the other side of the gas volume. Since December 2009 the RPC charge readout has been in operation on the entire central carpet (∼5800 m2). In this configuration the detector is able to measure the particle density at the core position where it ranges from tens to many thousands of particles per m2. Thus ARGO-YBJ provides a highly detailed image of the charge component at the core of air showers. In this paper we describe the analog readout of RPCs in ARGO-YBJ and discuss both the performance of the system and the physical impact on the EAS measurements. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J Nucl Mater,"Blast furnace slag/Portland cement composites are routinely used for immobilising intermediate level nuclear wastes in the UK. Using high cement replacement levels reduces hydration exotherm and lowers pH. Although a lower grout pH will be beneficial in reducing the corrosion of certain encapsulated reactive metals such as aluminium, the degree of slag reaction will also be lower which may result in the formation of less hydration products and which in turn may reduce the capacity to immobilise waste ions. Adding neutral salts such as calcium and sodium sulfate to the composite cement can potentially increase slag activation without significantly altering the pH of the cement matrix. Thus the corrosion of any encapsulated metals would not be affected. This paper describes some of the properties of a hydrated 9:1 blast furnace slag:Portland cement matrix containing added sulfates of calcium and sodium. The findings show that all additives caused an increase in the amount of slag that reacted when cured for up to 28 days. This produced more material able to chemically bind waste ions. Activation with gypsum produced the highest rate of slag reaction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,20152000839142,,"Collier, N.C. (1); Li, X. (1, 2); Bai, Y. (1, 3); Milestone, N.B.

Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao,"Aiming at the problem that current image processing and 3D scanning methods are difficult to compare the cut liner marks quickly and quantitatively, an adaptive matching algorithm for laser linear mark detection signals is put forward. The proposed algorithm firstly applies locally weighted regression scatter plot smoothing method to denoise the liner mark signals picked up by laser displacement sensor and retain their characteristic details, and then perform the identification of the 'thick & consistent' trend features in the signal data after de-nosing. After that, the cosine vector curve fitting method is adopted to quantify the feature vectors and calculate the sample spatial distance one by one. Finally, the dynamic programming algorithm is employed to conduct similarity comparison in batches, which will match the maximum similarity samples. The experiment results of cut mark multiple sample data similarity comparison demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ©, 2015, Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao/Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument.

RSC Adv.,"ZnO nanoparticles with high crystallinity and several nanometers in size were synthesized by a low-temperature solvothermal route from zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and methanol (CH3OH). The structural and the morphological characterizations of the ZnO nanoparticles were performed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N2-sorption isotherms. The obtained nanoparticles are highly crystalline wurtzite-type ZnO with a uniform near-spherical shape and an average particle size estimated to be 8.4 ± 1.3 nm. Such a small particle size and slight agglomeration are attributed to the use of methanol, which acts as both a solvent and an inhibitor of growth and agglomeration. The as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles were directly used as a gas sensing material toward n-butanol gas. Such a designed sensor device exhibits several advantages such as a high and fast response, short recovery time, and good stability toward n-butanol gas. At the optimal operating temperature (320 °C), its gas response toward 500 ppm n-butanol is 805 and the response and recovery times are 22 and 6 seconds, respectively. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,20152600980054,,"Liu, Xu (1); Chen, Nan (1); Xing, Xinxin (1); Li, Yuxiu (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 2); Wang, Yude (1, 2); Djerdj, Igor (3) ","(1) School of Physics Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Ruder Bokovi Institute, Bijenika 54, Zagreb; 10000, Croatia ",RSCACL,641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,,,,,Agglomeration - Gas detectors - Gases - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - II-VI semiconductors - Metal nanoparticles - Methanol - Organic solvents - Particle size - Potassium hydroxide - Synthesis (chemical) - Temperature - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray powder diffraction - Zinc oxide - Zinc sulfide - ZnO nanoparticles,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude ",10.1039/c5ra05148g,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,67,2015,English,X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,,34.0,54372-54378,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,A high-performance n-butanol gas sensor based on ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by a low-temperature solvothermal route,,Average particle size - Gas sensing material - High crystallinity - Morphological characterization - Operating temperature - Short recovery time - Small particle size - Zinc acetate dihydrate,5,

J. Liq. Chromatogr. Relat. Technol.,"A novel vortex-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method based on floating organic acid (VA-DLLME-FOA) droplet combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection was successfully developed for extraction and preconcentration of three estrogens (estriol (E3), 17β-estradiol (βE2), and estrone (E1)) in human urine. In this method, estrogens were extracted into fine droplets of nonanoic acid, which floated on the top of the sample solution. Vortex-mix instead of organic dispersive solvent was applied to assist the dispersion of the extraction solvent into aqueous samples; due to the elimination of dispersive solvent, high extraction efficiency and enrichment factor could be achieved. Factors affecting VA-DLLME-FOA (type and volume of the extraction solvent, sample pH, vortex-mix time, and centrifugation) were optimized. The relative standard deviations (RSD%, n = 5) were 1.56-2.98% and the limits of detection were 0.01 ng mL-1for E3, 0.01 ng mL-1for βE2, and 0.06 ng mL-1for E1. Recoveries of the estrogens in spiked human urine samples were in the range of 96.8-102.3%. The results showed that VA-DLLME-FOA was a simple, sensitive, low-cost, minimum organic solvent consumption and efficient analytical method for the separation and determination of estrogens in human urine samples. © 2015 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,20150400442616,,"Wang, Peijin (1); Qiu, Xiaoyan (2); Yang, Yaling (1) ","(1) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650105, China (2) Yunnan Institute of Standardization Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",JLCTFC,"461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds",,,,,Body fluids - Drops - Fluorescence - High performance liquid chromatography - Liquids - Saturated fatty acids - Solvents - Vortex flow,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Yaling(yilyil8@163.com) ",10.1080/10826076.2014.913522,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1520572X,,,,10826076,5,"March 16, 2015",English,Solvent extraction,,27.0,640-646,,2015,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Journal of Liquid Chromatography and Related Technologies,,Determination of estrogens in human urine by vortex-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on floating organic acid droplet combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection,,determination - estrogens - Fluorescence detection - Nonanoic acid - urine - Vortex-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction,38,
Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,"The classical dark channel theory algorithm has yielded good results in the processing of single fog image, but in some larger contrast regions, it appears image hue, brightness and saturation distortion problems to a certain degree, and also produces halo phenomenon. In the view of the above situation, through a lot of experiments, this paper has found some factors causing the halo phenomenon. The enhancement dark channel algorithm of color fog image based on the local segmentation is proposed. On the basis of the dark channel theory, first of all, the classic dark channel theory of mathematical model is modified, which is mainly to correct the brightness and saturation of image. Then, according to the local adaptive segmentation theory, it process the block of image, and overlap the local image. On the basis of the statistical rules, it obtains each pixel value from the segmentation processing, so as to obtain the local image. At last, using the dark channel theory, it achieves the enhanced fog image. Through the subjective observation and objective evaluation, the algorithm is better than the classic dark channel algorithm in the overall and details. © SPIE.

Int. J. Netw. Secur.,"Active scanning worms have drawn a significant attention due to their enormous threats to the Internet infrastructure and services. In order to effectively defend against them, this paper proposes a novel epidemic SEIQV model with quarantine strategy. Using this SEIQV model, we obtain the basic reproduction number for determining whether the worm dies out completely. The global stabilities of worm-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium are proved, and determined by the basic reproduction number. The impact of different parameters of this model is studied. Simulation results show that the number of susceptible, infected and vaccinated hosts are consistent with theoretical analysis. The model provides a theoretical foundation for controlling and forecasting for active scanning worms.",,,20152801010824,,"Wang, Fangwei (1, 2); Yang, Yong (3); Zhang, Yunkai (4); Ma, Jianfeng (2) ","(1) College of Information Technology, Hebei Normal University, No. 20, South ErHuan Road, YuHua District, Shijiazhuang; 050024, China (2) School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, No. 2, South Taibai Road, YanTa District, Xi'an, Shaanxi; 710071, China (3) Network Information Center, Yunnan University, No. 2, North CuiHu Road, WuHua District, Kunming; 650091, China (4) Department of Information Engineering, Shijiazhuang Institute of Railway Technology, Hebei Normal University, No. 18, Sishuichang Road, Qiaodong District, Shijiazhuang; 050071, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,,Network security - Scanning,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yunkai(zhyk@hebtu.edu.cn) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18163548,,,,1816353X,4,2015,English,Disease control,,25.0,423-430,,2015,"Femto Technique Co., Ltd.",International Journal of Network Security,,Global analysis of a SEIQV epidemic model for scanning worms with quarantine strategy,,Basic reproduction number - Endemic equilibrium - Epidemic modeling - Internet infrastructure - Quarantine strategy - Stability analysis - Theoretical foundations - Worm propagation models,17,
Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Sparse representation of signals have become an important tool in computer vision. In many applications in computer vision, such as image denoising, image super-resolution and object recognition, sparse representations have produced remarkable performance. In this paper, we propose a non-linear non-negative sparse coding model NNK-KSVD. The proposed model extended the kernel KSVD by embedding the nonnegative sparse coding. Experimental results show that by exploiting the non-linear structure in images and utilizing the ‘additive’ nature of non-negative sparse coding, promising classification performance can be obtained. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,20155301740720,,"Zhang, Yungang (1); Xu, Tianwei (1); Ma, Jieming (2) ","(1) Department of Computer Science, Yunnan Normal University, No.1, Yuhua Higher Education Town, Chenggong District, Kunming; 650000, China (2) School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Suzhou University of Science and Technology, No.1 Ke Rui Road, Suzhou; 215009, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.5 Computer Applications,152189.0,"June 14, 2015 - June 16, 2015","Suzhou, China","5th International Conference on Intelligence Science and Big Data Engineering, IScIDE 2015",Big data - Codes (symbols) - Computer vision - Image classification - Image denoising - Object recognition,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yungang(yungang.zhang01@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-23989-7_54,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319239873.0,03029743,,2015,English,Image coding,"Intelligence Science and Big Data Engineering: Image and Video Data Engineering - 5th International Conference, IScIDE 2015, Revised Selected Papers",23.0,531-540,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Non-negative kernel sparse coding for image classification,,Classification performance - Dictionary learning - Image super resolutions - Kernel methods - Non-negative sparse coding - Nonlinear structure - Sparse coding - Sparse representation,9242,
J. Mater. Chem. A,"Significant improvements in thermal and flame retardant properties of polymeric materials at low loadings hold tremendous promise for fire safety materials. In the present work, a highly effective graphitic carbon nitride/acidized multi-walled carbon nanotube (g-C3N4/aMWCNT) bilayer was deposited on a PS sphere for reducing its fire hazards. The PS sphere allowed the intimate assembly of the g-C3N4/aMWCNT bilayer on its surface through electrostatic interactions. Structural and morphological characterization revealed the successful assembly of PS/g-C3N4/aMWCNT systems. Enhanced thermal stability and flame retardancy (e.g. a decrease of ca. 45% and 47% in HRR and THR, respectively) were obtained for the ternary assembled systems instead of the binary materials. The phenomena were caused by two reasons: g-C3N4/aMWCNT bilayers induced the construction of the 'tortuous path' which impeded the permeation of heat and the escape of pyrolysis volatile products; on the other hand, stacked g-C3N4nanosheets or thermolabile aMWCNTs with an uncompact network structure led to poor thermal stability and fire resistance. Thus, this work paves a potential pathway to design efficient assembled fire-retardant systems for fire safety. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20153301170100,,"Shi, Yongqian (1, 3); Long, Ze (2); Yu, Bin (1, 3); Zhou, Keqing (1); Gui, Zhou (1); Yuen, Richard K.

Gongcheng Lixue,"In order to investigate the mechanical performance of continuous steel-concrete composite beams with web openings, five continuous composite beams with web openings and a continuous composite beam without web openings were tested. The behavior of plastic hinges and internal force redistribution were studied emphatically. The test results show that web openings decrease the stiffness and the ultimate load-carrying capacity. The plane hypothesis is not satisfied for section in the web opening area. The failure process of the five continuous composite beams shows that a shear force plastic hinge first formed and ultimately a kinematical mechanism generated in the region of the web opening. The continuous composite beams with web openings have already shown redistribution phenomenon when compared with the composite beams without web openings in elastic stage. In addition, the results reveal not only moment redistribution but also shear force redistribution between the concrete and steel components for continuous composite beams with web openings. © 2015, Engineering Mechanics Press.

Taiyangneng Xuebao,"In order to dry cut tobacco using solar energy, understanding the moisture variation of cut tobacco in the drying process, the investigation of drying characteristic of cut tobacco was carried out based on solar energy supply from trough concentrating system. By establishing the drying model, and drawing the drying characteristics curves, the influences of air flow temperature, speed and moisture content of cut tobacco in inlet on the drying characteristics of cut tobacco were achieved. The research results show that the drying rate of cut tobacco will increase with the rise of drying temperature(190-200)or air velocity(15-20 m/s)if the moisture content of cut tobacco and solid-gas ratio in inlet keep unchanged. However, the drying rate of cut tobacco keeps almost same when the moisture content of cut tobacco in inlet changes.

Opt Mater,"Ultraviolet-visible light emissions from nanocrystalline (nc) Ge-embedded SiO2 films fabricated by ion implantation and rapid annealing techniques are studied as a function of different fabricating conditions (implanting dose and annealing temperature). The samples exhibit seven photoluminescence (PL) peaks peaked at 1.68, 1.75, 1.84, 1.93, 2.00, 2.70, and 3.10 eV. There are also two excitation bands in the PL excitation (PLE) spectra peaked at 4.90 and 5.19 eV. Raman spectra are employed to observe and understand structural variations in SiO2 matrix during the formation of nc-Ge and defects. Within the frame of the quantum confinement (QC) theory and Oswald ripening growth model, the origin and evolution of the seven PL peaks and two PLE bands are identified clearly demonstrated by the proposed energy-level and generated process diagrams.

RSC Adv.,"Porous iron titanium oxide (Fe2TiO5) microparticulates have been successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route followed by a subsequent calcination process. Polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP), serving as a surfactant, played a pivotal role in controlling the size and inducing the mesoporous structure of Fe2TiO5. The measured specific surface area is 83.1 m2g-1and the dominant pore size is ca. 10 nm. When tested as the anode material of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the as-prepared porous Fe2TiO5microparticulates delivered a high reversible capacity of 468.3 mA h g-1after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1, which nearly quadrupled that of porous TiO2microspheres and doubled that of Fe2O3nanoparticles. Moreover, the porous Fe2TiO5microparticulates also showed more superior rate capability and long-term cycling stability with respect to TiO2and Fe2O3samples. Even after the rate performance test, a high discharge capacity of 234.1 mA h g-1was still maintained at a current density of 500 mA g-1over another 250 cycles.

Energy,"Filling a finite amount of high thermal conductivity materials into the base material to enhance the ETC (effective thermal conductivity) of the composite has attracted intensive interests, but how to disperse the fillers apparently poses a question. In the present study, we investigate the enhancement of ETC through altering the distribution of the fillers with an optimization method which is inspired by the volume-to-point heat conduction problem. The theoretical model is first validated by the theoretical results of the Parallel and Series models. Then it is used to investigate the way how to fill the high thermal conductivity materials. It is found that the distribution of fillers changes gradually from parallel type to series type as the relative location of temperature gradient of filling location is away from the highest temperature gradient. The closer to the highest temperature gradient, the larger ETC of the composite is.

Carbohydr. Res.,"Novel water-soluble inclusion complexes for fisetin (FIT) were developed by introducing β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and γ-CD. Properties of the obtained complexes, as well as the interactions between each component, were systematically investigated in both solution and solid states by means of ESI-MS, NMR, FT-IR, XRD, DSC, SEM etc. All characterization information demonstrated that FIT/CDs inclusion complexes were formed, and exhibited different spectroscopic features and properties from FIT. A complex with 1:1 stoichiometry of FIT and CDs was confirmed with Job's method. Meanwhile, as supported by molecular modeling calculations, we suggested that phenyl group (C ring) of FIT molecule was included in the CDs cavity from the wide side. Moreover, the water solubility of FIT/CDs was successfully improved from 2.8 mg/mL (in ethanol aqueous solution) to 4.5 mg/mL (FIT/β-CD complex) and 7.8 mg/mL (FIT/γ-CD complex), and higher thermal stability results were shown by thermal analysis for those complexes. Notably, the inclusion complexes displayed almost two times higher cytotoxicity compared to free FIT against Hela and MCF-7 cells. These results suggested that FIT/CDs complexes could be potentially useful in food industry and healthcare area. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

BioResour.,"Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) shiv has great potential for the production of bio-composites as a reinforcement material. To gain more information about hemp shiv, this research studied the influence of gender on the physical and mechanical properties of the fiber cell wall in the shiv of three dioecious hemp plant varieties by optical microscopy, image analysis software, WXRD, and nanoindentation. The results show that a hemp plant's gender greatly influences the properties of hemp shiv. While long and thin in female hemp shiv, the fibers are shorter with a larger diameter in male hemp shiv. In addition, the cell walls in female shiv are thinner than those in male shiv. The microfibril angle (MFA), relative degree of crystallinity, elastic modulus, and hardness values of fiber cell walls as well as the lignin content in male hemp plants are higher than those in female hemp plants. Besides, the relationship between mechanical properties and MFA do not align with those observed in previous research, which shows that the gender of an individual plant has a greater effect on the mechanical properties of the fiber cell wall than does its MFA. Thus, when the fiber from this dioecious plant is investigated or used, the sex of the plant should be known and considered.",,Open Access,20153601249212,,"Li, Xiaoping (1); Du, Guanben (1); Wang, Siqun (2); Meng, Yujie (2) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Wood Adhesives and Glue Products, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming; 650224, China (2) Center for Renewable Carbons, University of Tennessee, Knoxville; TN; 37996, United States ",,"461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.3 Biomechanics, Bionics and Biomimetics - 761 Nanotechnology - 819.1 Natural Fibers - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Biomechanics - Cells - Cytology - Hemp fibers - Mechanical properties - Nanoindentation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Xiaoping(lxp810525@163.com) ",10.15376/biores.10.2.2281-2288,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19302126,,,,,2,2015,English,Hemp,,20.0,2281-2288,,2015,North Carolina State University,BioResources,,Influence of gender on the mechanical and physical properties of hemp shiv fiber cell wall in dioecious hemp plant,,Different varieties - Fiber cells - Gender - Hemp shivs - Image analysis software - Mechanical and physical properties - Physical and mechanical properties - Relative degree of crystallinity,10,

Intl. J. Earth Sci. Eng.,"It is important basis to analysis sand flow evolution process during the failures of tailing dam for evaluating the damage degree. This paper presents study on sand flow evolution during the failures of tailing dam by using unsteady two-dimensional planar equation averaged on depth. The depth and velocity field of sand flow within the area affected by tailing dam failure are obtained by applying nonlinear iteration and discretized analysis of tailing flow model. In addition, numerical analysis performed by using FLUENT further provides detailed characteristics of tailing distribution and the velocity variation during tailing failure. The results show that the velocity reaches the maximum value between 15s and 30s after the breach with the maximum destruction; after 30s, the velocity of tailing flow decreases dramatically and at 90s, velocity at the head is almost the same as that in the middle of flow. © 2015 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

J Alloys Compd,"In this present study, the thermal stability, crystal structures, and molecular structure of the sulfate titanium slag and the microwave treated samples were also analyzed using TG, XRD, and Raman spectrum, respectively. The reaction mechanism of oxidation reaction and the polymorphic transformation of the sulfate titanium slag were systematically investigated to identify the reaction processes. The effects of both temperature and time on the structure and chemical properties of the microwave treated samples were systematically investigated. The analysis results of the FeO-TiO2-TiO1.5phase diagram showed that the oxidation reactions were occurred along the line of anosovite (Fe3Ti3O10)-low valent titanium-TiO2. The results of XRD showed that the anosovite phase of the sulfate titanium slag were transform to the rutile TiO2phase under microwave heating at 950 °C for 60 min. The Raman spectrum results demonstrate that the vibration bands of low-valent titanium in the sulfate titanium slag were disappeared, and the vibrations bands of rutile TiO2were formed after microwave heating processing.

Biomed. Mater.,"Postoperative infections remain a risk factor that leads to failures in oral and maxillofacial artificial bone transplantation. This study aimed to synthesize and evaluate a novel hydroxyapatite whisker (HAPw) / nano zinc oxide (n-ZnO) antimicrobial bone restorative biomaterial. A scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterize and analyze the material. Antibacterial capabilities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and kinetic growth inhibition assays were performed under darkness and simulated solar irradiation. The mode of antibiotic action was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The MIC and MBC were 0.078-1.250 mg ml-1and 0.156-2.500 mg ml-1, respectively. The inhibitory function on the growth of the microorganisms was achieved even under darkness, with gram-positive bacteria found to be more sensitive than gram-negative, and enhanced antimicrobial activity was exhibited under simulated solar excitation compared to darkness. TEM and CLSM images revealed a certain level of bacterial cell membrane destruction after treatment with 1 mg ml-1of the material for 12 h, causing the leakage of intracellular contents and bacteria death. These results suggest favorable antibiotic properties and a probable mechanism of the biomaterial for the first time, and further studies are needed to determine its potential application as a postoperative anti-inflammation method in bone transplantation. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,20151100624300,015001,"Yu, Jian (1, 2); Zhang, Wenyun (1); Li, Yang (1, 2); Wang, Gang (1); Yang, Lidou (1); Jin, Jianfeng (3); Chen, Qinghua (4); Huang, Minghua (4) ","(1) Department of Stomatology, Kunming General Hospital of Chengdu Military Region, #212 Daguan Road, Xishan District, Yunnan Province, Kunming, China (2) Clinical College of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China (3) Kunming Municipal Stomatological Hospital, Kunming, China (4) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China ",,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 462.5 Biomaterials (including synthetics) - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Antibiotics - Bone - Cytology - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Enzyme inhibition - Escherichia coli - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Hydroxyapatite - II-VI semiconductors - Microwave integrated circuits - Scanning electron microscopy - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction - Zinc oxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1088/1748-6041/10/1/015001,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1748605X,,,,17486041,1,"February 1, 2015",English,Biomaterials,,68.0,,,2015,Institute of Physics Publishing,Biomedical Materials (Bristol),,"Synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and mechanism of a novel hydroxyapatite whisker/nano zinc oxide biomaterial",,Anti-microbial activity - Antibacterial mechanisms - Confocal laser scanning microscopy - Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS) - Gram-positive bacterium - Hydroxyapatite whiskers - Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) - Minimum inhibitory concentration,10,

Ruan Jian Xue Bao,"The trustworthiness of software is determined by both its functional requirements and non-functional requirements. Especially, the non-functional requirements are the determinants of the trustworthy software that show how it achieves the users' desired goals. Considering the importance of trustworthy software and the urgent needs for it, an approach to obtaining process strategies for trustworthy software in the early phase of requirements engineering is proposed. Firstly, the definition of trustworthy software requirements is defined as the combination of the trustworthiness requirements and the quality requirements. Trustworthiness requirements are defined as both functional requirements and trustworthiness concerns. Quality requirements are defined as soft goals. Then, based on fuzzy set theory and information entropy, acquisition method of trustworthiness concerns and soft goals is proposed. On this basis, process strategies for obtaining framework are proposed. Unlike the traditional early-phase requirements engineering which focuses on technical and design decisions, the aim of this study is to make process decisions to support trustworthy software development. In addition, to address the conflict relationships of the non-functional requirements, a reasoning method is developed for solving satisfiability problems of non-functional requirements in trustworthy software. Finally, through analyzing a trustworthy third-party certificate authority software case, feasibility of the proposed approach is described. © Copyright 2015, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The results show that the method is feasible, zero order displacement response is the largest, the first order perturbation displacement response and the second order perturbation displacement response were relatively small. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20162002375238,7428702,"Xiao, Mei-Ling (1); Yan, Ming-Jiao (1); Chen, Yang (1); Ye, Liao-Yuan (2); Liu, Ben-Yu (3) ","(1) School of Urban Construction and Management of Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China (2) Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, Yunnan, China (3) College of Resources and Environment, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,484 Seismology - 484.2 Secondary Earthquake Effects - 731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations,119925.0,"December 19, 2015 - December 20, 2015","Chongqing, China","IEEE Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IAEAC 2015",Control nonlinearities - Earthquakes - Nonlinear equations - Seismic response - Vibration analysis - Wavelet transforms,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/IAEAC.2015.7428702,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 11461078, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41164002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation ofChina (Grant 11461078, 41164002) Yunnan Province Department of science and technology major project 2012CA024.

Dig Tech Papers IEEE Int Pulsed Power Conf,"Power transformer assumes the important role in transportation of power energy; however, the initial faults inside transformer would eventually develop into catastrophic failure during its operation, which could result in the outage of equipment. Winding deformation and movement are considered to be the most common faults inside transformer. This paper proposed an online detection method for power transformer winding deformation and movement. As the key component, a capacitive coupling sensor mounting on the bushing was used to realize impulse signal injection. The safety of this sensor was primarily verified on a 110 kV bushing. In addition, the feasibility of the proposed method was validated through the experiment. The results show that the proposed method may reach the potential to detect winding deformation and movement when transformer is in service. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20160201784350,7296881,"Zhao, Z.

J Power Sources,"An effective approach of alcoholysis is employed to prepare hollow CoS2@C hybrid nanosheets aggregates as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. Amorphous carbon can be loaded on the CoS2nanoparticles uniformly in the solvothermal alcoholysis process, and the subsequent calcination results of the formation of hollow structures. The capacity of the sample can remain stable as high as 720 mAhg-1after 200 cycles, and it also exhibits good rate capacity. The nano-scaled characteristics of CoS2nanosheets embedded in the aggregates ensure the electrode having a high capacity and the fast Li-ion diffusion in the electrode. The in-situ introduction of carbon renders the electrode having a good electronic conductivity and can effectively prevent the formation of polysulfide anions. The unique hollow structures can shorten the length of Li-ion diffusion, which is benefit for the rate performance. The hollow structure also offers a sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change. Therefore, the prepared hierarchical hollow CoS2@C materials constructed by nanosheets exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Anim Biotechnol,"Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gamma (GADD45G) is a reproduction related gene. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence of porcine GADD45G gene was cloned through rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. The porcine GADD45G gene encodes a protein of 159 amino acids that shares high homology with the GADD45G of nine species: chimpanzee (97%), sumatran orangutan (97%), white-tufted-ear marmoset (97%), northern white-cheeked gibbon (97%), cattle (97%), human (97%), rhesus monkey (97%), rat (96%), and mouse (95%). This novel porcine gene was assigned to GeneID: 100152997. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the porcine GADD45G gene has a closer genetic relationship with the GADD45G gene of cattle. Computer-assisted analysis indicated that porcine GADD45G gene is structured in four exons and three introns.

J. Environ. Sci. Health Part A Toxic Hazard. Subst. Environ. Eng.,"This article presents the results of the study on accumulation, distribution, contamination and probable dietary intake of total mercury (THg) in fruiting bodies of several species of Fungi genus Xerocomus, which emerged in the circum-Pacific mercuriferous belt region in southwestern China in Yunnan and beyond of the mercuriferous belts in the region of Europe. The mushrooms X. puniceus (Boletus amygdalinus), X. spadiceus (Boletus ferrugineus) and X. versicolor (X. rubellus) were from the Yunnan land, and X. badius (Boletus badius) was from the region of Europe in Belarus and X. badius, X. chrysenteron, X. ferrugineus, X. versicolor (X. rubellus) and X. subtomentosus from Poland. The THg in the fungal and soil materials was determined using validated method by cold-vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy. Estimated was also probable dietary intake and health risk from THg in Xerocomus spp. examined by consumers. The data showed that THg content of Xerocomus spp. emerged in the European localizations in Poland and Belarus is at an order of magnitude lower level than determined in samples from the Yunnan Province. A reason for an elevated content of THg in mushrooms from Yunnan can be related to abundance of Hg in the geochemical background of soils there. The assessed doses showed that a single meal composed of 300 g of fresh fruiting bodies of X. spadiceus from the Wuding localization in Yunnan in China if consumed once a week will provide THg at dose close to the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) value set for THg, while doses will be lower for all other localizations in Yunnan and Europe. In the Wuding localization in Yunnan a frequent consumption of X. spadiceus in volume exceeding 300 g of fresh fruiting bodies per week will provide THg at a dose exceeding the value of PTWI. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,20153301161419,,"Kojta, Anna K.

"World Environ. Water Resour. Congr.: Floods, Droughts, Ecosyst. - Proc. World Environ. Water Resour. Congr.","Along with the rapid increase of the permeability of small hydropower's installed capacity in China's electric power systems, the output of small and large hydropower crowd in power transmission channel, which easily leads to nest electricity, even causes massive abandoned electricity. This phenomenon is more serious in small hydropower rich region, such as Yunnan and Sichuan province in China. This paper proposes a short-term scheduling method of small and large hydropower coordination, which is used to solve problems of hydropower consumption. In this method, the goal is maximizing the hydropower consumptive electricity in mixed nested transmission section. To solve this model, we propose a transmission section description method to analysis complex transmission section constraint in the power grid. On this basis, taking into account the characteristics of small hydropower, then coupling successive approximation algorithm and associated search strategies are proposed to solve this model. Aiming at the conflict situation of the constraint condition and transmission section limit, a more limited output correction method is proposed to adjust the output of exceeding the upper limit and allocate the unavoidable abandon water output. We apply this method to the hydropower system operated by Yunnan Power Grid (YNPG) over 96-points the horizon, and analyze the performance of this method by making the quarter-hourly generation schedules of small and large hydropower plants. © 2015 ASCE.",,,20152701007198,,"Wu, Huijun (1); Cheng, Chuntian (1); Wu, Xinyu (1); Li, Xiufeng (2); Cai, Huaxiang (2); Cai, Jianzhang (2) ","(1) Institute of Hydropower and Hydroinformatics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian; 116024, China (2) China Yunnan Power Dispatching Center, Kunming; 650011, China ",,444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 912.2 Management - 921 Mathematics - 921.5 Optimization Techniques,112350.0,"May 17, 2015 - May 21, 2015","Austin, TX, United states","World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2015: Floods, Droughts, and Ecosystems",Approximation algorithms - Drought - Ecosystems - Electric power systems - Electric power transmission - Floods - Hydroelectric power - Optimization - Scheduling - Small power plants - Water resources,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1061/9780784479162.185,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9780784479162.0,,,2015,English,Electric power transmission networks,"World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2015: Floods, Droughts, and Ecosystems - Proceedings of the 2015 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress",7.0,1896-1903,1of1,2015,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),"World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2015: Floods, Droughts, and Ecosystems - Proceedings of the 2015 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress",Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),A short-term scheduling method of small and large hydropower coordination of China's electric power systems,,coordination - large hydropower - Short term - Small hydro power - Transmission sections,,
J. Chin. Cereals Oils Assoc.,"In order to research the effect of absence of Wx gene on wheat starch biosynthesis, eight Wx near-isogenic wheat lines were used as materials. Amylose, amylopectin, total starch content and synthesis speed were determined during the grain filling period of 10, 20, 30 and 40 days. The results showed that the contents and accumulation rates of amylose, amylopectin and total starch increased after flowering. These elements reached the maximum value 10~20 days after flowering, and then decreased gradually. The effect of 3 Wx genes on the content and accumulation rate of amylose was Wx-B1>Wx-A1>Wx-D1. The Wx genotypes showed a significant influence on starch biosynthesis and accumulation through synthesis and accumulation of amylase. While Wx genotypes did not involve in the biosynthesis of amylopectin. The effect of Wx genotypes on total starch biosynthesis and accumulation could be mainly influenced through amylose. ©, 2015, Editorial Department, Chinese Cereals and Oils Association.

Appl. Energy,"To perform this comparison, the compound parabolic concentrator with a restricted exit angle of 65° (CPC-65) and the one without exit angle restriction (CPC-90) were fabricated and tested for concentrating radiation on multi-crystalline solar cells. Both CPC-65 and CPC-90 are identical in the acceptance half-angle (20°) and geometrical concentration factor (2×). Theoretical calculations showed that CPC-90 based PV system (CPV-90) annually concentrated about 3-5% more radiation on solar cells as compared to CPC-65 based PV system (CPV-65). For CPV-65, all radiation would arrive on the solar cells at the incidence angle less than 65°, but for CPV-90, about 8-10% of annual collectible radiation would arrive on solar cells at the incidence angle larger than 65°. Measurements at outdoor conditions showed that the CPV-65 performed slightly better than CPV-90 in terms of short-circuit current and power output as the projection incidence angle of solar rays on the cross-section of CPC-troughs (θp) less than the acceptance half-angle, otherwise the CPV-90 did better. Compared to CPV-90, the power output at maximum power points from CPV-65 were slightly higher, and increases of 2.1%, 5.4% and 8.17% were measured for θp=0°, 10° and 16°, respectively. Analysis indicated that effect of solar flux distribution over solar cells on power output of both CPVs was almost identical and insignificant, and the CPV-65 performed slightly but insignificantly better than the CPV-90 in terms of annual power output except in areas with poor solar resources where the annual power output from both systems was almost identical. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152600971132,,"Yu, Yamei (1); Liu, Nianyong (1); Li, Guihua (1); Tang, Runsheng (1) ","(1) Education Ministry Key Lab. of Advanced Technology and Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",APENDX,657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells,,,,,Incident solar radiation - Photovoltaic cells - Thermoelectric power,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Runsheng ",10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is partial fulfillment of funded research programs 51066007 and 51466016 , financially supported by Natural Science Foundation of China .",,03062619,,"October 01, 2015",English,Solar cells,,30.0,284-293,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Applied Energy,,Performance comparison of CPCs with and without exit angle restriction for concentrating radiation on solar cells,,Exit angles - Experimental investigations - Performance comparison - PV modules - Theoretical analysis,155.0,

Water Resour. Manage.,"In this study, an improved single-step method (SSM) is developed based on two-step method (TSM) to solve the interval-parameter linear programming (ILP) model of which the right-hand sides are highly uncertain. Two numerical examples are presented to ascertain appropriate value of λ in SSM. The risk preference degree of λ could be 0.8 for maximum objective function type. To demonstrate the applicability of the developed method, an agricultural water management problem has been provided in the case study section. The results show that SSM is more effective than TSM for complete solutions. There is only partial solution obtained from the first submodel of TSM, because the right-hand side of the wheat output constraint is highly uncertain.

Biotechnol. Lett.,"Cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1) plays a crucial role in regulating the level of plant cellular reactive oxygen species and its thermolability is proposed to cause plant heat-susceptibility. Herein, several hyper-acidic fusion partners, such as the C-terminal peptide tails, were evaluated for their effects on the thermal stability and activity of APX1 from Jatropha curcas and Arabidopsis. The hyper-acidic fusion partners efficiently improved the thermostability and prevented thermal inactivation of APX1 in both plant species with an elevated heat tolerance of at least 2 °C. These hyper-acidified thermostable APX1 fusion variants are of considerable biotechnological potential and can provide a new route to enhance the heat tolerance of plant species especially of inherent thermo-sensitivity. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,20151200668120,,"Zhang, Mengru (1); Gong, Ming (1); Yang, Yumei (1); Li, Xujuan (2); Wang, Haibo (3); Zou, Zhurong (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Biomass Energy and Environmental Biotechnology of Yunnan Province, Engineering Research Center of Sustainable Development and Utilization of Biomass Energy, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Sugarcane Genetic Improvement, Sugarcane Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kaiyuan; Yunnan; 661600, China (3) College of Biological Resources and Environmental Science, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; Yunnan; 655011, China ",BILED3,641.1 Thermodynamics,,,,,Stability,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zou, Zhurong(zzr09@sina.com) ",10.1007/s10529-014-1754-4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15736776.0,,,,01415492,4.0,2015,English,Thermodynamic stability,,22.0,891-898,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Biotechnology Letters,,Improvement on the thermal stability and activity of plant cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 by tailing hyper-acidic fusion partners,,Ascorbate peroxidase - Biotechnological potentials - C-terminal peptides - Cellular reactive oxygen species - Fusion partners - Jatropha curcas - Thermal inactivation - Thermostability,37.0,
"Int. Conf. Affect. Comput. Intell. Interact., ACII","Text-based sentiment analysis is a growing research field in affective computing, driven by both commercial applications and academic interest. Continuous dimensional representations, such as valence-arousal (VA) space, can represent the affective state more precisely than discrete effective representations. In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Therefore, recent studies have investigated the automatic development of VA lexicons using linear regression techniques. One of the major limitations of linear regression is the under-fitting problem which can cause a poor fit between the algorithm and the training data. To tackle this problem, this study proposes the use of a locally weighted linear regression (LWLR) model to predict the valence-arousal ratings of affective words. The locally weighted method performs a regression around the point of interest using only training data that are local to that point, and thus can reduce the impact of noise from unrelated training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved better performance for VA word prediction. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161502238709,7344604,"Wang, Jin (1, 2); Lai, K.

J. Phys. Chem. C,"A series of sodium zinc gallogermanate sosoloid Na2-y(Zn1-xGax)GeO4: yTb3+(x = 0, 0.1, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, and 0.20; y = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04) samples were successfully synthesized and their luminescence properties were investigated. It was found that Zn vacancies could be the predominant contribution to the enhancement of PL and LLP intensities when Ga3+ions were introduced as solute atoms substituted the crystal sites of Zn2+in Na2ZnGeO4host. Zn vacancies act not only as an exciton energy-level participated in the PL process but also as trapping centers contributed to the LLP process. Furthermore, the energy transfer processes from Na2(Zn0.8Ga0.2)GeO4host to Tb3+ions in PL and LLP were identified. Accordingly, the LLP colors changed from blue to green with increasing concentration of Tb3+and the mechanism of which was proposed. Besides, after irradiation with 800 nm femtosecond pulsed laser, a blue upconversion LLP phenomenon was clearly observed in Na2(Zn0.8Ga0.2)GeO4for the first time. Analysis suggested that multiphoton absorption process was dominant in this upconversion luminescence, and subsequently the carriers excited into conduction band were captured by the trapping centers. Then the realization of LLP was due to the thermal stimulated recombination of holes and electrons at traps.

Two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used to model the emission properties of TeV-bright shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) and to explore their nature. Methods. In the leptonic scenario for the TeV emission, the α-ray emission is produced via inverse Compton scattering of background soft photons by high-energy electrons accelerated by the shocks of the SNRs. In a previous paper, we showed that since the energy densities of the cosmic microwave background radiation and that of the IR/optical background photons are much higher than that of the photons produced by the same high-energy electrons via the synchrotron process, the observed correlation between X-ray and TeV brightness of SNR RXJ1713.7-3946 can be readily explained with the assumption that the energy density of relativistic electrons is proportional to that of the magnetic field. The TeV emissivity is therefore proportional to the magnetic field energy density and MHD simulations can be used to model the TeV structure of such remnants directly. Two-dimensional MHD simulations for SNRs are then performed under the assumption that the ambient interstellar medium is turbulent with the magnetic field and density fluctuations, following a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum. Results. (1) As expected, these simulations confirm early 1D and 2D modelings of these sources, namely the hydrodynamical evolution of the shock waves and amplification of magnetic field by Rayleigh-Taylor convective flows and by shocks propagating in a turbulent medium; (2) we reproduce rather complex morphological structure for α-rays, for example, the bright thin rim and significant asymmetry, suggesting intrinsic variations of the source morphology not related to the structure of the progenitor and environment; and (3) the observed radial profile of several remnants are well reproduced with an ambient medium density of 0.1-1 cm-3. An even lower ambient density leads to a sharper drop of the TeV brightness with radius than what is observed near the outer edge of these remnants. Conclusions. In a turbulent background medium, we can reproduce the observed characteristics of several shell-type TeV SNRs with reasonable parameters except for a higher ambient density than that inferred from X-ray observations. © ESO 2014.",,,20145100332628,A37,"Yang, Chuyuan (1, 2); Liu, Siming (3); Fang, Jun (4); Li, Hui (5) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China (2) Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China (3) Key Laboratory of Dark Matter and Space Astronomy, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science, Nanjing; 210008, China (4) Department of Astronomy, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (5) Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos; NM; 87545, United States ",AAEJAF,615.3 Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) Power Generation - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 932.1 High Energy Physics,,,,,Alpha particles - Cosmology - Inverse problems - Luminance - Magnetohydrodynamics - Neutrons - Photons - Shock waves - Supernovae - Turbulence - X rays,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Chuyuan ",10.1051/0004-6361/201424667,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320746,,,,00046361,,"January 1, 2015",English,Tellurium compounds,,56.0,,,2015,EDP Sciences,Astronomy and Astrophysics,,The structure of TeV-bright shell-type supernova remnants,,Complex morphological structure - Cosmic microwave background radiation - High-energy electron - Inverse Compton scattering - Magnetic field energy - Magnetohydrodynamic simulations - Radiation mechanisms: non thermal - Relativistic electron,573,

If the scale of a problem exceeds a certain threshold, the problem is difficult to solve by traditional or formal optimization approaches. In this paper, scheduling problem is modeled with interval indexed formulation. In the model, intervals formation are very important to the efficiency of the algorithm. We proposed two methods for improving the intervals. First method is increasing time limit approach and the second one is long-short time limit approach. We test our algorithm on a kind of NP-hard problem-single machine total weighted tardiness problem.

Mater. Sci. Forum,"Large-area SiNWs has been successfully fabricated through one-step metal-assisted chemical etching process at room temperature. The effects of key fabrication parameters (AgNO3concentration, Fe(NO3)3concentration, and etching time) on the nanostructure SiNWs were carefully investigated by SEM, TEM, respectively. The results show that AgNO3concentration and Fe(NO3)3concentration play important roles to the lengths and arrangements of SiNWs arrays in one-step MACE. The morphological transition of Si surfaces from solid nanowires to porous nanowires can be found with increasing AgNO3concentration and Fe(NO3)3concentration, which indicates that the re-dissolved Ag+would work as the main oxidative species for oxidizing the silicon substrate and forming SiNWs in the HF/ AgNO3/ Fe(NO3)3etching system. The length of SiNWs is increased with increasing AgNO3concentration from 0.005 mol/L to 0.02 mol/L and etching time, the chemical polish phoenomenon can be observed when the Fe(NO3)3concentration increases to 0.5 mol/L.

Rock Soil Mech,"Using the theory of upper bound limit analysis method and the volume force increment method, considering the defects of limit analysis model of a single sliding surface, an arbitrary block model considering the dislocation effects of multiple rock layers with structural joints is established. When the rock mass reaches the limit state (destruction) under external load, the work that is done by external loads is equal to the work that rock mass absorbs. Based on this premise, relevant equation can be established; thereby the calculation formula of slope stability coefficient can be derived. After analyzing typical numerical examples of slope and comparing to results of discrete element numerical simulation, the feasibility and applicability of this method are verified. A calculation of bedding rock slope located in Puli-Xuanwei highway in Yunnan province is achieved, the result shows that the stability coefficient is close to the result obtained from discrete element numerical simulation. The coefficient is slightly larger, but the slope is stable. It provides a new calculation method for evaluating the stability of this kind of slope. ©, 2015, Yantu Lixue/Rock and Soil Mechanics.

Soil Tillage Res.,"Mountainous regions are more susceptible to food insecurity because of the shortage of farmland and the conflict between population and cultivated land resources. Here, we focused on the Yunnan province, a typical mountainous region in southwest China, where soil productivity plays a key role in agricultural development. The objectives were to assess spatial variation and sustainable utilization of soil productivity in the Yunnan province. We constructed a soil database based on 706 soil profiles collected from China's second national soil survey, and assessed soil productivity with a soil productivity index model. We found significant differences in the soil productivity indexes among soil types; the indexes ranged from 0.12 to 0.85 and averaged 0.47. Higher productivity soils generally occurred in forest areas within the west and northwest sub-regions of Yunnan, while lower productivity soils tend to be located at low or extremely high elevations. The soil productivity index was lowest for barren land, followed by dry farmland, grassland, paddy fields, horticultural land, and forest lands. We found the productivity index to increase significantly as latitude increased and to vary with altitude at lower elevations. The soil productivity index ranged from 0.32 to 0.61 generally from the southeast sub-region to the northwest sub-region. Conversion of forest land or grassland to dry farmland may seriously degrade soil productivity. Local governments should consider soil productivity conservation practices when seeking to exploit land resources in mountainous areas. Yunnan's western sub-region has high potential for agricultural development. Effective soil remediation measures and soil and water conservation are needed in the central and southeast sub-regions to maintain sustainable soil productivity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20144800266658,,"Xingwu, Duan (1, 2); Li, Rong (2); Guangli, Zhang (2); Jinming, Hu (2); Haiyan, Fang (3) ","(1) Asian International Rivers Center, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Key Lab of International Rivers and Trans boundary Eco-security, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Key Laboratory of Water Cycle and Related Land Surface Processes, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China ",SOTRD5,403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 444 Water Resources - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Farms - Forestry - Land use - Natural resources - Productivity - Soil conservation - Soil pollution - Soils - Spatial distribution - Water conservation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xingwu, Duan ",10.1016/j.still.2014.11.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 41101267, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41301099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: -, Acronym: DWR, Sponsor: Department of Water Resources; Number: 2011FZ009, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China (grant number: 41101267 and 41301099 ), Basically Apply Research Plan of Yunnan Province (grant number: 2011FZ009 ), and Department of Water Resources of Yunnan Province: Water Science and Technology Project .

Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao,"Geomembrane with optical fibers is a new type of anti-seepage material, which provides a function of determining the cleft places itself. To study the stability of slope of the laterite dam embedded with the geomembrane with optical fibers, shear strength tests and anti-slide model tests were performed, so that test data about the membrane-soil interface, for example, the cohesion, the friction angle, the slip gradient and the frictional coefficient, were obtained. The data were compared with the ones of the pure laterite and of the laterite with the built-in composite geomembrane. The interface between the geomembrane with optical fiber and the laterite was found to have enough affinity to resist shearing. The anti-slide stability of the dam slope met the specified requirement if the geomembrane with optical fiber was used in earth dam. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol.,"Proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) (EC 1.5.99.8) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of proline. The enzyme JcProDH and its complementary DNA (cDNA) were isolated from Jatropha curcas L., an important woody oil plant used as a raw material for biodiesels. It has been classified as a member of the Pro_dh superfamily based on multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic characterization, and its role in proline catabolism. Its cDNA is 1674 bp in length with a complete open reading frame of 1485 bp, which encodes a polypeptide chain of 494 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 54 kD and a pI of 8.27. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that JcProDH showed high similarity with ProDH from other plants. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that JcProDH was especially abundant in the seeds and flowers but scarcely present in the stems, roots, and leaves. In addition, the expression of JcProDH increased in leaves experiencing environmental stress such as cold (5 °C), heat (42 °C), salt (300 mM), and drought (30 % PEG6000). The JcProDH protein was successfully expressed in the yeast strain INVSc1 and showed high enzyme activity in proline catabolism. This result confirmed that the JcProDH gene negatively participated in the stress response. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20151000611890,,"Wang, Haibo (1, 2); Ao, Pingxing (1); Yang, Shuanglong (1); Zou, Zhurong (1); Wang, Shasha (1); Gong, Ming (1) ","(1) School of Life Sciences, Engineering Research Center of Sustainable Development and Utilization of Biomass Energy, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Biomass Energy and Environmental Biotechnology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) College of Biological Resources and Environmental Science, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; Yunnan; 655011, China ",,461.8.1 Genetic Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 801.2 Biochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 822.3 Food Products,,,,,Cloning - Dyes - Encoding (symbols) - Enzyme activity - Metabolism - Polymerase chain reaction - Signal encoding - Transcription - Yeast,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gong, Ming(gongming6307@163.com) ",10.1007/s12010-014-1441-x,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15590291,,,,02732289,5,2015,English,Gene encoding,,56.0,2413-2426,,2015,Humana Press Inc.,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,,Molecular Cloning and Expression Analysis of the Gene Encoding Proline Dehydrogenase from Jatropha curcas L,,Jatropha curcas l - Molecular cloning - Multiple sequence alignments - Phylogenetic analysis - Phylogenetic characterization - Proline dehydrogenase - Reverse transcription PCR - Yeast expression,175,
RSC Adv.,"The principal objective of this study was to develop a sensitive and selective electrochemical sensor for phoxim detection based on a reduced graphene oxide-gold nanocomposite (RGO-Au) modified grassy carbon electrode (GCE). The proposed sensor was fabricated by pulsed electrodeposition of reduced graphene oxide followed by chronoamperometric deposition of Au nanoparticles, and applied for the electrochemical detection of phoxim. The modified electrode was characterized by SEM, UV-vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and XRD. The electrocatalytic activity of RGO-Au/GCE towards reduction of phoxim was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. The results showed that the RGO-Au nanocomposite could greatly enhance the electrochemical reduction of phoxim. Under optimal conditions, the reduction peak current was proportional to phoxim concentration over a wide range between 0.01 and 10 μM, and the detection limit was 0.003 μM (S/N = 3). The proposed phoxim biosensor also exhibited excellent stability and reproducibility. In addition, the sensor was successfully employed for determining phoxim in a variety of food samples.

RSC Adv.,"Polyurethane polymers were synthesized as novel solid-solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) by bulk polyaddition in the absence of organic solvents, in which polyethylene glycol (PEG) was selected as the working phase change substance and Span 80 and Tween 80 were used as crosslinking agents for the first time. The chemical structures, crystalline properties, phase change properties and thermal stability of the synthesized SSPCMs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). An accelerated thermal cycling test was carried out to reveal the thermal reliability of the synthesized SSPCMs. The XRD patterns showed that the synthesized SSPCMs have a completely crystalline structure and defective crystallization compared with the pristine PEG. The DSC results showed that the synthesized SSPCMs have suitable phase change temperatures of 37-48 °C and high latent heats in the range of 120-130 J g-1.

"Proc. - Int. Conf. BioMed. Eng. Informatics, BMEI","In this paper, the relationship between the blood flow velocity and Doppler power spectrum in stenosed vessel is investigated to determine the variation between the maximum velocities and their frequency locations at the spectra in the vessels with different degrees of stenosis, and then a new method is proposed to extract the maximum velocity of blood flow in narrowed vessels. Firstly, a geometric vessel-model with stenosis of bilateral symmetry axis is established to get the flow velocity distributions for different degrees of stenosis, and then the Doppler spectra from entire segment of the vessel covered by sound field are calculated. Finally, corresponding maximum frequency locations in the spectra are determined according to a comparison between the maximum values from blood flow velocity distributions and their calculated spectra. The theoretical analysis shows that the maximum frequencies, which correspond to the maximum velocities of blood flow for different degrees of stenosis, locate at different positions in the spectral falling-edge. For the normal vessel, the location is at the middle position of the falling-edge, and down shifts along the falling-edge with the increase of the stenosis degree approximately linearly. The proposed method could be helpful to extract the maximum velocities of blood flow in stenosed vessels. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161702306748,7401507,"Zhang, Yingyun (1); Zhang, Yufeng (1); Gao, Lian (1); Hu, Xiao (1); Zhang, Kexin (2) ","(1) Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China (2) Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical College, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,"461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 631 Fluid Flow - 751 Acoustics, Noise.

Opt Quantum Electron,"Exhibiting extremely high electric polarization, N-polar Group III-nitrides heterostructure has been widely used on high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) and terahertz photodetectors in recent years. In this paper, we numerically investigated an N-polar GaN/AlGaN/GaN HEMT device in which the two-dimension electron gas is in-duced at the top GaN/AlGaN interface. Characteristics of the device were determined by using experimental data to calibrate the few adjustable parameters of our simulations. Effects of interface charges on the device were researched by changing the component of Al. In addition, the dependency of scaling the device dimensions on direct current (DC) output characteristics, such as the gate length and the barrier height was also analyzed in details. Our simulations showed that increases of Al mole fraction and AlGaN barrier height and a decrease of the gate length can improve the DC performance of HEMT device to some extent.

IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,"In order to shorten the revisit period, and improve the efficiency of imaging, currently, all the in orbit high resolution remote sensing satellites adopt side-view imaging technology. When satellites imaging with a side perspective, it would inevitably cause the degradation of image quality, like spatial resolution reduction, image deformation incensement, and the reduction of positioning accuracy. In addition, with the increase of the side perspective, the error of DEM data will be amplified in the process of ortho-rectification, which, thus, will bring bigger error for image mapping accuracy. To address this problem, embarked from the impact of side view and DEM precision on image point error, this paper used Quick bird image data of the same area but different side perspectives, and simulate the impacts of different DEM elevation error on different side view image. At last we put forward a method to determine the maximum side perspective with map precision constraints, and set up a conversion relationship among satellite side view, DEM error and image point error. Finally, the paper combines the errors of 1:50000 DEM, ASTERGDEM and the requirement of ortho-image drawing, discusses and gives the values of maximum side perspective in the mountains and plains. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",,,20155201736282,,"Yang, Jihong (1); Li, Haiwei (2, 4); Zhan, Yin (1); Shi, Liangshu (1); Wang, Jinqiang (3); Chen, Zhengchao (4) ","(1) Chinese Land Surveying and Planning Institute, Beijing; 100035, China (2) School of Geosciences and Info-Physics, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (3) Surveying and Mapping Bureau of Yunnan Province, Kunming Yunnan; 650034, China (4) Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100094, China ",,405.3 Surveying - 655.2 Satellites - 821 Agricultural Equipment and Methods; Vegetation and Pest Control,159169.0,"September 16, 2014 - September 19, 2014","Beijing, China","8th IFIPWG 5.14 International Conference on Computer and Computing Technologies in Agriculture, CCTA 2014",Agriculture - Mapping - Orbits - Remote sensing - Satellites,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Zhengchao(zcchen@ceode.ac.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-19620-6_2,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783319196190.0,18684238,,2015,English,Errors,"Computer and Computing Technologies in Agriculture - 8th IFIPWG 5.14 International Conference, CCTA 2014, Revised Selected Papers",11.0,13-22,1 of 1,2015,Springer New York LLC,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,"Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery (CSAM); Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering (CSAE); Etal; International Commission of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, Session VII; National Natural Science Foundation of China; WG 5.14, International Federation for Information Processing",A method to determine the maximum side perspective of satellite with the constraints of mapping accuracy,,DEM accuracy - Geolocations - High resolution remote sensing - Image deformation - Imaging technology - Ortho-rectification - Positioning accuracy - Spatial resolution,452,

In the age of 'big data', the constructed concepts are often represented as higher-dimensional data by scholars, and thus the sparse learning techniques are introduced into ontology algorithms. In this paper, based on the alternating direction augmented Lagrangian method, we present an ontology optimization algorithm for ontological sparse vector learning, and a fast version of such ontology technologies. The optimal sparse vector is obtained by an iterative procedure, and the ontology function is then obtained from the sparse vector. Four simulation experiments show that our ontological sparse vector learning model has a higher precision ratio on plant ontology, humanoid robotics ontology, biology ontology and physics education ontology data for similarity measuring and ontology mapping applications. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,,20160401835246,1540034,"Gao, Wei (1); Zhu, Linli (2); Wang, Kaiyun (3) ","(1) School of Information and Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) School of Computer Engineering, Jiangsu University of Technology, Changzhou; 213001, China (3) Department of Ed., Kunming University, Kunming; 650214, China ",,"405.3 Surveying - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 731.5 Robotics - 921.1 Algebra - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 961 Systems Science",,,,,Anthropomorphic robots - Big data - Constrained optimization - Digital storage - Iterative methods - Knowledge representation - Lagrange multipliers - Learning algorithms - Mapping - Plants (botany) - Vectors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gao, Wei(gaowei@ynnu.edu.cn) ",10.1142/S0218127415400349,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 11401519, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments in improving the quality of this paper.

Shuili Xuebao,"For tunnel construction under high in-situ stress condition, the selection of a reasonable cross-section and supporting measures has important meaning to ensure the short-term stability of tunnel and long-term operational safety. According to the tunnel section under high in-situ stress at the Dianzhong water-conveyance project, comparison analyses for the stress, deformation and plastic zone distribution and the corresponding value of surrounding rock mass, which are used by different tunnel cross-section, the type of horseshoe shape for tunnel section is determined. This shape of tunnel section is advantageous to the stress distribution of surrounding rock mass and structural stability. On the basis of comprehensive analyses for the stress, deformation and plastic zone distribution characteristics of surrounding rock mass, and combined with the engineering analogy method to design the temporary support measures and permanent lining scheme. By comparison of the value of tunnel deformation and depth of plastic zone before and after reinforcement treatment, simulated results show that, the temporary support measures can effectively control the rock deformation and reduce the plastic zones, and the surrounding rock of tunnel is under a steady state and no significant plastic zone existed after permanent lining. ©, 2015, Shuili Xuebao/Journal of Hydraulic Engineering.

These structures effectively simplify genome-wide association studies by reducing the number of mutations to be examined. Here, a haplotype block was analysed which located on 22q12.3 (Position: 34876961-34890077), a noncoding region of chromosome 22. Statistical tests suggested that the region is selectively neutral with a very low recombination rate. The genetic diversity analysis shows that the African population (AFR) has higher diversity than non-AFR populations. The results show that only 52 of 2,184 possible haplotypes are observed on this block. The haplotype distribution concentrates on 4~5 common haplotypes in non-African populations. However, the haplotypes are more evenly and more widely expressed in AFR. Due to genetic drift or sampling, these SNPs with strong LD(Linkage Disequilibrium) of this block is not observed in ASN.

Key Eng Mat,"The objective of this study was to develop a novel silica modified large-sized hydroxyapatite whiskers with improved properties for use in bone repair applications. Large-sized whiskers with a mean length of 250μm were obtained by a hydrothermal co-precipitation method at 150°C, 7.5Mpa in high-pressure reactor. Silica modified hydroxyapatite whiskers were prepared by dissolving TEOS in ethanol solution, then sintering with hydroxyapatite. The compositional and morphological properties of prepared whiskers were studied by means of x-ray diffraction(XRD), Fouier transform infrared(FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy(SEM). The results indicated the evidence of nano-silicon dioxide particles on the surface of HAP whiskers. The size of nano-silicon dioxide particles depends on dropping and stirring rate.

Phys E,"Highly ordered mesoporous material MCM-41 was synthesized from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as Si source and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as template. Well-dispersed NiO nanoparticles were introduced into the highly ordered mesoporous MCM-41 by chemical precipitation method to prepare the highly ordered mesoporous NiO/MCM-41 composite. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement were used to examine the morphology and the microstructure of the obtained composite. The morphological study clearly revealed that the synthesized NiO/MCM-41 composite has a highly ordered mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 435.9 m2g-1. A possible formation mechanism is preliminary proposed for the formation of the nanostructure. The adsorption performance of NiO/MCM-41 composite as an adsorbent was further demonstrated in the removal azo dyes of methyl orange (MO), Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB) and rhodaming B (RB) under visible light irradiation and dark, respectively. The kinetics and mechanism of removal methylene blue were studied. The results show that NiO/MCM-41 composite has a good removal capacity for organic pollutant MB from the wastewater under the room temperature.

Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am.,"Nonlinear site models are an important part of ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and can be constructed in a number of ways. If numerous soil-site strong-motion records contain the effect of strong nonlinear soil response, the parameters for the nonlinear model can be a part of the regression parameters for GMPEs. It is also possible to derive nonlinear site models by numerical simulation. However, the number of strong-motion records from Japan that contain the effect of strong nonlinear soil response is still too small to derive nonlinear site terms. We present a model of nonlinear site terms using site class as the site parameter in GMPEs based on a 1D equivalent linear model. The 1D model was constructed based on the shear-wave velocity profiles from the KiK-net strong-motion stations with a wide range of site periods, soil depth, and impedance ratios. The rock-site strong-motion records were from different earthquake categories in Japan and the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center dataset. Those records had a wide range of earthquake magnitudes, source distances, and peak ground accelerations. A random effects regression model was fitted to the calculated spectral amplification ratios, accounting for the effect of site impedance ratios, earthquake magnitudes, and source distances of the rock-site records.We also designed a method to adjust the 1D model so it can be used in a GMPE, accounting for the fact that a 1D model is an overly simplistic assumption for many real strong-motion recording stations in many parts of the world. © 2015, Seismological Society of America.

Wuli Xuebao,"Flexible control of terahertz waves is now a research hotspot. Based on the electromagnetic theory the dispersion relation and field distributions in a plasmon-assisted parallel-plated waveguide are deduced. The transmission property of such a waveguide is obtained and confirmed by the full-wave simulation. Results show that the plasmon-assisted parallel-plated waveguide shows a band gap characteristic, and the cutoff frequency of the upper sideband is equal to the plasmon frequency; generally, the thinner the plasmon layer, the higher the cutoff frequency will be, and the narrower the bandwidth will become. Emergence of the band gap is due to the excited surface plasmon polaritons, and the coupling between surface plasmon and the medium in the waveguide. Besides, the influence of plasmon frequency and collision frequency on the transmission properties is investigated, and a method for adjusting the filter characteristic of the waveguide by tuning the plasmon frequency is proposed. Moreover, the plasmon layer is realized by a textured metallic structure, and a sensing model based on the parallel-plated waveguide is designed. Simulation results show that a 0.1 percent change in permittivity of the sample materials filling in the groove will give rise to a significant change of the cutoff frequency, which is 1.8 GHz in average; interestingly, different liquid samples such as nitrogen, gasoline, paraffin, glycerine and water can be identified through detecting the change of cutoff frequency, which further confirms the excellent terahertz sensing characteristic of the proposed sensor.

The polarity of traveling wave and lightning current was taken into account to remove some lightning records with different polarity. For computing the correlation degree of lightning records and traveling wave data, the number of detection station demonstrated the accuracy of lightning records is considered.

Some useful theoretical results, specifically, the cumulative distribution functions of the proposed test statistics, are obtained for calculating and evaluating statistical significance on real observations. Simulation results show that the two types of combined test statistics can control the type I error rate well and have higher power than the ordinary HotellingT2 test when only a small part of the high-dimensional distributions have non-zero means.

Anal. Methods,"Although many studies have focused on DNA and RNA extraction, only a few have focused on the simultaneous extraction of high quality DNA and RNA from environmental samples, especially for acidic habitat samples. In this study, a widely used DNA extraction method (Zhou, J. Z., M. A. Bruns, and J. M. Tiedje 1996) was optimised for the simultaneous extraction of crude nucleic acid (including DNA and RNA), and a LiCl salt-based step-by-step precipitation method was also optimised for the separation of DNA and RNA. The results showed that nucleic acid extraction buffer (pH 7.0) containing piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) salt could effectively extract crude nucleic acid from acidic habitat samples, and the optimised LiCl salt-based step-by-step precipitation method could separate the nucleic acid into high quality DNA and RNA. The results also showed that the obtained DNA and RNA could be used for downstream molecular analysis. This study developed a useful method for the simultaneous extraction and separation of DNA and RNA from acidic habitat samples. This method has a great potential as a standard method to obtain high quality nucleic acid from biohydrometallurgy processes and extreme environmental samples. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,20150700515646,,"Xie, Jianping (1, 2, 6); Yun, Hui (1, 4, 6); Dong, Haigang (3, 5); Zhao, Wenya (1, 6); Wang, Guohua (1, 6); Qiu, Guanzhou (1, 6); Liu, Xinxing (1, 6) ","(1) School of Mineral Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan; 410083, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan; 410083, China (3) Kunming Institute of Precious Metals, Kunming, Yunnan; 650106, China (4) Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100085, China (5) State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technologies for Comprehensive Utilisation of Platinum Metals, Kunming, Yunnan; 650106, China (6) Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha, Hunan; 410083, China ",,454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Biomolecules - Chlorine compounds - DNA - Ecosystems - Lithium compounds - Nucleic acids - Precipitation (chemical) - RNA,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Dong, Haigang(donghaigang0404@126.com) ",10.1039/c4ay01608d,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17599679,,,,17599660,3,"February 7, 2015",English,Extraction,,50.0,909-917,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,Analytical Methods,,"Simultaneous extraction, separation and purification of microbial genomic DNA and total RNA from acidic habitat samples",,Acid extraction - Biohydrometallurgy - Environmental sample - Molecular analysis - Precipitation methods - RNA extraction - Separation and purification - Simultaneous extractions,7,
Jinshu Xuebao,"The crystal structure, phase transformations and magnetic properties for Ni50-xCoxMn39Sn11(x=0, 2, 4, 6) Heusler alloys have been systematically studied by means of structure and magnetism measurements. The results show that with increase of Co concentration, the martensitic transformation temperatures are obviously decreased, while the Curie temperatures of austenite are gradually increased, and they present different structures at room temperature. At the same time, with increasing Co content, the austenitic magnetism rapidly enhances, while the martensitic magnetism almost keeps unchanged. This leads to a significant improvement of difference magnetization (ΔM) between two phases. For Co content added to x=4, the value of ΔM between two phases achieves about 40 Am2/kg and exhibits magnetic field-induced martensitic transformation. Using strain measurement, the strain behavior related to martensitic transition in Ni50-xCoxMn39Sn11(x=0, 2, 4) samples was studied. It is found that the phase transition strain reaches 0.17% in Ni46Co4Mn39Sn11sample. Within the magnetic cycles of 3 T, this sample displays a reproducible magnetostrain in temperature range of 215~235 K. Such a reproducible strain could be ascribed to the fact that a partial martensitic transformation of this sample can be driven by isothermal magnetic field. ©, 2015 All right reserved.",,,20153701268637,,"Li, Zhe (1); Xu, Chen (1); Xu, Kun (1); Wang, Hao (1); Zhang, Yuanlei (1); Jing, Chao (2) ","(1) Key Laboratory for Advanced Functional and Low Dimensional Materials of Yunnan Higher Education Institute, College of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; 655011, China (2) Department of Physics, Shanghai University, Shanghai; 200444, China ",CHSPA4,531.2 Metallography - 543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Austenitic transformations - Cobalt - Cobalt alloys - Crystal structure - Magnetic fields - Manganese alloys - Shape memory effect - Tin alloys,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhe(zheli@shu.edu.cn) ",10.11900/0412.1961.2015.00071,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,04121961,8,"August 11, 2015",Chinese,Martensitic transformations,,32.0,1010-1016,,2015,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Jinshu Xuebao/Acta Metallurgica Sinica,,"Study of martensitic transformation and strain behavior in Ni50-xCoxMn39Sn11(x=0, 2, 4, 6) heusler alloys",,CO concentrations - Different structure - Magnetic field-induced martensitic transformation - Magnetostrain - Martensitic transformation temperatures - Martensitic transitions - Strain behaviors - Temperature range,51,
Dairy Sci. Technol.,"Yond bap is a traditional fermented milk product from the Yunnan province in China. Yond baps are mostly produced with goat’s milk and occasionally with cow’s milk. As a traditional dairy product produced by fermentation, yond bap contains an abundant microflora. The microbes that play a role in the fermentation of goat milk form a specific community structure. In this work, 11 types of yond bap were characterized from four different regions in the Yunnan province. We employed bar-coded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA to analyze the bacterial community structure in the yond baps. The results indicated that the bacterial community structures of the 11 yond baps were different. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were detected in all the samples. Pseudomonas, a proteobacterium, was the predominant bacterial genus. Pseudomonas sequences were detected often and in most of the samples. Next, Streptococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Lactococcus belonging to Streptococcaceae family played important roles in the fermentation of yond baps as the numbers of sequences belonging to these species were higher. The results demonstrate the presence of different bacterial community structures of yond baps from different regions in the Yunnan Province of China.

The numerical simulation of the spray system in condensing tower was established by a CFD simulation software, obtained the spatial distribution of the water droplet diameter, and the simulation results are in good agreement with the fitted experimental values. The law of the influence of the effect of parameter variation to the spray system was obtained by the changing of spray pressure, diffusion angle and gas velocity in the tower: with the increasing of atomization pressure, the droplet diameter decreases, but the droplet diameter distribution is more uniform at a low pressure. With the diffusion angle increasing, the droplet diameter and relative falling velocity of the droplet decrease; the larger of the gas velocity, the larger of the droplets diameter being taken out of the tower. The results may provide a basis for optimizing the parameters of the spray system and improving the efficiency of condensation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20162402496126,,"Zhu, Dan (1); Song, Peng Yun (1) ","(1) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,"402.1 Industrial and Agricultural Buildings - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.5 Computer Applications - 802.3 Chemical Operations",151869.0,"May 30, 2015 - May 31, 2015","Guangzhou, China","International Conference on Energy Equipment Science and Engineering, ICEESE 2015",Atomization - Chimneys - Computational fluid dynamics - Condensation - Drops - Nitrogen compounds - Water vapor,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781138029330.0,,,2015,English,Computer software,"Advances in Energy Science and Equipment Engineering - Proceedings of International Conference on Energy Equipment Science and Engineering, ICEESE 2015",8.0,1571-1574,2 of 3,2015,CRC Press/Balkema,"Advances in Energy Science and Equipment Engineering - Proceedings of International Conference on Energy Equipment Science and Engineering, ICEESE 2015",,Simulation of the water atomization for recovering the water vapor in exhausts from ammonium phosphate production,,Ammonium phosphates - Atomization pressure - CFD simulations - Droplet diameters - Effect of parameters - Experimental values - Falling velocity - Water atomization,2,

A novel optimization model is developed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on the available work loss minimization for the recuperator. The adequacy of the model is examined using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The final optimization results show that an optimum combination of the geometrical parameters of the recuperator exists that leads to a minimum available work loss at certain conditions. It has been proven that the relative error of the optimum results is less than 1.4%.

Solid State Commun,"In this paper, the changes of volume fractions between austenitic and martensitic phase have been carefully deduced through magnetization data for polycrystalline Ni46.7Co5Mn33In15.3alloy during reverse martensitic transformation at different magnetic fields. On this basis, the contributions of the lattice and the spin components to the total entropy changes could be effectively separated by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and the Debye theory calculations. It is concluded that the lattice contribution works against the magnetic contribution to the inverse magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in this alloy. Further analysis indicates that the effective inverse MCE comes from field-induced variation of the crystal structure. On the contrary, the change of the magnetic moment alignment in this process yields negative contribution, leading to a reduction of the total inverse MCE by about 33%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Nanoscience Nanotechnology Lett.,"We report an efficient paper-based surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate platform based on a filter paper loaded with Au porous nanospheres (Au PNSs). The Au PNSs with high electric near-field intensity enhancement were synthesized through a seed-mediated growth method. From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, it can be found that the average diameter of the Au PNSs is about 55 nm. Due to the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged Au PNSs (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-capped) and negatively charged filter paper composed of cellulose, the Au PNSs can be efficiently immobilized into a filter paper, fabricating a Au PNSs-paper substrate. The obtained Au PNSs-paper substrate is found to be highly SERS sensitive for 10 nM Rhodamine 6G and exhibit excellent reproducibility (∼6% relative standard deviation) and long term stability.

Chem. Ind. For. Prod.,"Using deresinated montan wax(DMW) of E'shan(ESDMW) from Yunnan province as the material, chroma value (L) as the main index, new oxidation bleaching of DMW were developed. The bleaching effects of three kinds of oxidation systems, i. e., peroxide (H2O2), peracetic acid (CH3COOOH) and H2O2/CH3COOOH system, were investigated. The results showed that H2O2/CH3COOOH system was better than the single systems of H2O2 and CH3COOOH. The main process parameters in H2O2/CH3COOOH system was optimized using the response surface method. The optimal conditions were m(CH3COOOH):m(ESDMW) 20:1, m(H2O2):m(ESDMW) 36.7:1, time 80 min and temperature 118.5. Under these conditions, the L value of the product was 62.02, which was almost consistent with the model prediction. The joint use of H2O2/CH3COOOH system with the Cr6+ was explored. The results showed that the bleaching effect of the joint use of Cr6++CH3COOOH/H2O2 was better than any other methods used before. More importantly, under the premise of better bleaching effect, the dosage of Cr6+ was significantly reduced by the optimized process. ©, 2015, The Editorial of «Chemistry and Industry of Forest Products».

Diangong Jishu Xuebao,"The extended black-start strategy during the early recovery stage after blackout provides a new way for power system restoration. In order to evaluate the aftereffect of an extended black-start scheme, through discretizing the network reconstruction process into a series of successive time steps, a multi-objective network reconstruction optimization model considering the alternation and coordination that unit restarting with load restoration during subsequent reconstruction process is established, and then a solving method combining the lexicographic optimization method with improved bacterial foraging algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm is proposed to solve the model. The units, loads and restoration paths in each time step are optimized from the perspective of the global optimum to obtain the optimal reconstruction scheme. After that, by defining a group of input and output indexes reflecting the multiple elements of reconstruction process, the relative efficiency of the subsequent reconstruction, which represents the aftereffect of the extended black-start scheme, are evaluated by using the super efficiency data envelopment analysis model. The test results on the New England 10-unit 39-bus system verified the validity and correctness of the proposed method. ©, 2015, Chinese Machine Press.

Knowl Based Syst,"As a novel and generalized fuzzy set, hesitant fuzzy set have received increasing attention and have been a popular research topic recently. However, many crossover calculations are needed to aggregate hesitant fuzzy information for multiple calculations in its general operation, whereas much more of these calculations are needed in hesitant fuzzy group decision making. This paper proposes optimal discrete fitting aggregation and simplified optimal discrete fitting aggregation as two new aggregation approaches to resolve this issue. The paper also distinguishes their similarities and differences, proves some desired properties, and provides the selected methods and modeling steps. Moreover, the length extended technology and the deviation function are developed as the applied basis of the new approaches.

Appl Surf Sci,"A convenient room temperature approach was developed for growing rutile TiO2 hierarchical structures on the wood surface by direct hydrolysis and crystallization of TiCl3 in saturated NaCl aqueous solution. The morphology and the crystal structure of TiO2 coated on the wood surface were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The TiO2 morphology on the wood surface could be tuned by simply changing either the reaction time or pH value of the reaction mixture. After modification with perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTS), the water contact angle (WCA) of the TiO2-treated wood (T1) surface increased to 140.0 ± 4.2°, which indicated a highly hydrophobic wood surface. In addition, compared with untreated control wood, PFDTS-TiO2 treatment (PFDTS-T1-treated) not only reduced liquid water uptake, but also delayed the onset of water saturation point of the wood substrate. The weight change of PFDTS-T1-treated wood after 24 h of water immersion was 19.3%, compared to 81.3% for the untreated control wood. After 867 h of water immersion, the weight change for the treated and untreated wood specimens was 117.1%, and 155.1%, respectively. The untreated control wood reached the steady state after 187 h, while the PFDTS-T1-treated wood did not reach the steady state until after 600 h of immersion. © Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20150600500641,,"Zheng, Rongbo (1, 2); Tshabalala, Mandla A.

Environ Prog Sustainable Energy,"The removal of phosphine (PH3) was studied with an electrochemical approach using a Ti/SnO2anode. The effects of the current density, O2content, gas flow rate, temperature, and type of electrolyte on the PH3removal were investigated. The liquid phase reaction products were detected by ion chromatography. It was observed that PH3was effectively removed in the electrochemical reactor and phosphate (PO43-) existed in solution after reaction. Increasing current density, oxygen content and reaction temperature can enhance the removal of PH3. 0ver 85% PH3was removed with an operation condition of current density of 53.05 mA/dm2, 65°C, 4.6 vol % O2and gas flow rate of 200 mL/min in 0.1 mol/L Na2SO4aqueous solution. Chosen Na2SO4as electrolyte, removal efficiency remained stability and it would be conducive to the recovery of phosphate (PO43-). The gas flow rate influence is remarkably clear in the reactor where it was evident that the most efficient gas flow rate toward a 90% PH3removal was reached at 50 mL/min. Electrochemical oxidation will be a potential method for the PH3removal because of its low cost, long duration removal efficiency and the valuable hydrogen byproduct produced. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.",,,20152600978871,,"Qu, Guangfei (1); Zhang, Jian (1); Lin, Yilu (1); Li, Junyan (1); Ning, Ping (1); Yu, Yongtao (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650500, China ",ENVPDI,631 Fluid Flow - 631.1.2 Gas Dynamics - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 702 Electric Batteries and Fuel Cells - 801 Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Current density - Efficiency - Electrochemical oxidation - Electrolytes - Flow of gases - Flow rate - Ion chromatography - Phosphates - Phosphorus compounds - Sodium sulfate - Solutions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Qu, Guangfei(qgfljy@sina.com) ",10.1002/ep.12169,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19447450,,,,19447442,6,November/December 2015,English,Sulfur compounds,,36.0,1640-1646,,2015,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,Environmental Progress and Sustainable Energy,,Electrochemical method for wet removal of phosphine,,ELectrochemical methods - Electrochemical reactor - Liquid-phase reaction - Operation conditions - phosphine - Potential methods - Reaction temperature - Removal efficiencies,34,
J Non Cryst Solids,"The Ag ions were introduced into the Bi doped silicogermanate glasses by Ag+for Na+ion exchange method. After ion exchange, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum implied the Ag ions were mainly in ionic form (Ag+) within the glasses.With the increase of the Ag+concentration, more relaxation of local structure would be induced at the non-bridging oxygen (NBO), meaning that the network gave more negative sites. Bi3+ions could be reduced to lower valence states of Bi containing Bi near infrared (NIR) active centers with the depolymerization of glass network, resulting in the enhancement of the Bi NIR luminescence. After heat treatment, the XPS, absorption spectra and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images revealed Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) formed in glasses. With the increase of the Ag NPs concentration, more NBOs released from Ag+, which led to reduce more Bi3+ions to lower valence states of Bi containing Bi NIR active centers, resulting in further enhancement of the NIR luminescence. Our research may extend the understanding of structural modulation in Bi valence states and offer a valuable way to enhance the NIR luminescence of Bi in glasses. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Minerals Eng,"The spatial symmetry of mineral crystals has a strong potential for the unintentional floatability variation of minerals. In this study, the flotation and oxidation behaviors of two pyrites with the same FeS2stoichiometry but with different spatial symmetry were evaluated. The results show that an increase of pH and aerating time significantly increases the depression of pyrite with space group Pa3 during flotation, whereas pyrite with space group Pca21 is more difficult to depress compared to Pa3 pyrite with increasing pH. The aerating time inappreciably increases the depression of Pca21 pyrite. XPS analyses of the surface species of both pyrite samples with the same oxidation treatment confirm that more hydrophilic species (e.g.; ion oxy-hydroxy species and sulfate) are present on Pa3 pyrite than Pca21. This result indicates that Pa3 pyrite is more easily oxidized than Pca21 pyrite. DFT was introduced to study the crystal structures and electronic structure of the two pyrites at the atomic scale. The cell models show that Pa3 pyrite has a central symmetry structure, whereas Pca21 pyrite forms with a non-centrosymmetry structure. The calculated values of the band gap of Pa3 and Pca21 pyrites suggests that the two pyrites have similar features of semiconduction. The DOS comparison implies that there are less Fe 3d orbit on the Pca21 pyrite surface crossing the Fermi level and suggests that the stability and oxidizability of Pca21 pyrite surface would be greater than Pa3. The stability and oxidizability of pyrite surfaces are most likely responsible for the difference of flotation and oxidation behaviors of the two pyrites. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20150300436889,,"Xian, Yongjun (1, 2); Wang, Yijie (1, 2); Wen, Shuming (1, 2); Nie, Qi (3); Deng, Jiushuai (1, 2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Land Resource Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Faculty of Mining Engineering, Kunming Metallurgy College, Yunnan, Kunming; 650033, China ",MENGEB,802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice,,,,,Crystal atomic structure - Crystal symmetry - Electronic structure - Energy gap - Flotation - Oxidation - Sulfur compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wen, Shuming(shmwen@126.com) ",10.1016/j.mineng.2014.12.016,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014M562343, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 51464029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: KKSY201421110, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 51464029 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded Project (Grant No. 2014M562343 ) and Scholar Development Project of Yunnan Province (Grant No. KKSY201421110 ) is sincerely appreciated.",,08926875,,"March 1, 2015",English,Pyrites,,38.0,94-100,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Minerals Engineering,,Floatability and oxidation of pyrite with different spatial symmetry,,Calculated values - Central symmetry - Hydrophilic species - Non-centrosymmetry - Oxidation behaviors - Oxidation treatments - Space Groups - Spatial symmetry,72,

High Temp Mater Processes,"An analytical approach is proposed to optimize the thickness of petroleum coke for achieving maximum microwave power absorption in microwave heating based on analysis of reflection loss (RL). The microwave RL of the petroleum coke layer was studied over the moisture content range of 1%-5% at 20 C and the petroleum coke (10% moisture content) in the temperature range of 20 to 100 C at 2.45 GHz. The results show that RL depends sensitively on the thickness of the petroleum coke and the absorption peak shifts towards a larger thickness as the moisture content of the petroleum coke increases. There exists a matching thickness corresponding to the maximum microwave absorption, the maximum absorbing peak decreases when the thickness of petroleum coke exceeds the matching thickness. We also show that the absorption peak is found to move towards a smaller thickness region with increasing petroleum coke temperature. © 2015 by De Gruyter 2015.",,,20152600976473,,"Shang, Xiaobiao (1); Chen, Junruo (1); Peng, Jinhui (2); Chen, Hua (2); Zhang, Weifeng (1); Guo, Shenghui (2); Chen, Guo (2) ","(1) Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",HTMPEF,513.3 Petroleum Products - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 711.1 Electromagnetic Waves in Different Media - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 944.2 Moisture Measurements,,,,,Absorption - Microwave heating - Microwaves - Moisture - Moisture determination - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Junruo ",10.1515/htmp-2014-0058,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51304097, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011IA004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013AA064003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012DFA70570, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Funding: This work was supported by the National Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program, No. 2013AA064003), the International S&T Cooperation Program of China (No. 2012DFA70570), the Yunnan Provincial International Cooperative Program (No. 2011IA004), and Project (51304097) supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.",,03346455,4,"July 1, 2015",English,Petroleum coke,,19.0,367-372,,2015,Walter de Gruyter GmbH and Co.

Optik,"Epipolar geometry is an important concept in projective geometry, and it has been applied to camera calibration only gradually. In this study, using three non-concentric circles as a calibration pattern to ascertain the coordinates of the projected circle centres, the vanishing line could be computed by taking advantage of the linear relationship between the pole and the polar line to determine the camera's intrinsic parameters. In the image plane, the line passing through the two projected circle centres is a degenerate conic section, so it can be written in the form of a linear combination of two projected circles. In addition, the projected circle centre can be obtained by solving a linear equation. Because the relationship between the centre of a circle and the vanishing line is similar to the relationship between the pole and the polar line, the vanishing line can be determined by solving a linear equation. The results of our experiments show that this approach is effective and has high precision. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.",,,20152901045022,,"Chen, Xu (1); Zhao, Yue (2) ","(1) Tourism and Culture College of Yunnan University, Lijiang, Yunnan Province, China (2) College of Mathematics and Statistics, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan Province; 650091, China ",,408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 742.2 Photographic Equipment,,,,,Calibration - Linear equations - Poles,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Yue(zhao6685@yeah.net) ",10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.06.036,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2011FB017, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013Y167, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11361074, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 11361074 ), the Natural Foundation of Yunnan Province , China (grant no. 2011FB017 ), and the Scientific Research Foundation of the Yunnan Education Department of China (grant no. 2013Y167 ).",,00304026,20,"October 1, 2015",English,Cameras,,19.0,2565-2570,,2015,Elsevier GmbH,Optik,,The projected circle centres and polar line for camera self-calibration,,Camera intrinsic parameters - Circle centre - Circular points - Polar lines - Vanishing line,126,

The experimental results show that the block medical image fusion algorithm is more efficient than other common image fusion algorithms, and prove the adaptive PCNN method is effectively as well. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20160801983714,7339067,"Yang, Hengfen (1); Jin, Xin (1); Zhou, Dongming (1) ","(1) Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",,723.1 Computer Programming - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 746 Imaging Techniques,118376.0,"September 23, 2015 - September 25, 2015","Beijing, China","6th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science, ICSESS 2015",Medical imaging - Neural networks - Software engineering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Dongming(zhoudm@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1109/ICSESS.2015.7339067,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),23270594,,,9781479983520.0,23270586,,"November 25, 2015",English,Image fusion,ICSESS 2015 - Proceedings of 2015 IEEE 6th International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science,12.0,330-333,1of1,2015,IEEE Computer Society,"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences, ICSESS",,Block medical image fusion based on adaptive PCNN,,Image fusion algorithms - Linking strength - Oscillation frequency - Pulse coupled neural network - Source images - spatial frequenc - Spatial frequency,2015-November,
Dyn. Syst.,"Multivalued maps have many applications. We consider one-dimensional multivalued maps whose graphs are defined by lower and upper boundary maps. Let I = [0, 1] and let be a partition of I into a finite number of intervals. Let τ, τu: I → I be two piecewise expanding maps on such that τ ≤ τu. Let G ⊂ I×I be the region bounded by the graphs of τ and τu. Any map η: I → I that takes values in G is called a selector of the multivalued map defined by G. We assume that τ and τu as well as all the selectors we consider have invariant distribution functions. Let F∗ be a target distribution. We prove the existence of a selector η∗ which minimizes the functional, where η has invariant distribution Fη. Other results pertain to the functional, where Pη is the Frobenius-Perron operator of η acting on distribution functions.

Pattern Recogn.,"We present a robust global and local mixture distance (GLMD) based non-rigid point set registration method which consists of an alternating two-step process: correspondence estimation and transformation updating. We first define two distance features for measuring global and local structural differences between two point sets, respectively. The two distances are then combined to form a GLMD based cost matrix which provides a flexible way to estimate correspondences by minimizing global or local structural differences using a linear assignment solution. To improve the correspondence estimation and enhance the interaction between the two steps, an annealing scheme is designed to gradually change the cost minimization from local to global and the thin plate spline transformation from rigid to non-rigid during registration. We test the performance of our method in contour registration, sequence images and real images, and compare with six state-of-the-art methods where our method shows the best alignments in most scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Ceram Int,"One dimensional Mn-Ce-Oxcomposite nanomaterials with various Mn contents were synthesized successfully by a hydrothermal method. The impacts of Mn contents on their morphologies and physical properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The analysis reveals that the obtained composites are one-dimensional (1D) rod-like nanostructures. The catalytic behaviors of Mn-Ce-Oxnanomaterials were investigated for CO oxidation. The Mn-Ce-Oxcatalysts were found to be more active than catalysts based on ceria alone. The catalytic activities of all one dimensional Mn-Ce-Oxmaterials for CO conversion are quite high (14250%xcomposite nanomaterials with 40 wt% Mn exhibit the best catalytic activity and the 50% CO conversion can be reached at 142 °C. The presence of transition metal element Mn can promote the production of oxygen vacancies and improve oxygen mobility, which result in enhancing the oxygen-storage capacity of the one dimensional Mn-Ce-Oxmaterials and its catalytic performance for CO conversion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",,,20145200369342,,"Xing, Xinxin (1); Cai, Yun (1); Chen, Nan (1); Li, Yuxiu (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Wang, Yude (1, 2) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Mico-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",CINNDH,543.2 Manganese and Alloys - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Catalytic oxidation - Cerium compounds - Cerium oxide - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Manganese - Manganese oxide - Nanocatalysts - Nanostructured materials - Nanostructures - Oxidation - Oxygen vacancies - Scanning electron microscopy - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.014,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: ZD2013006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: XT412003, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2011FA001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51262029 ), the Key Project of the Department of Education of Yunnan Province ( ZD2013006 ), Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University ( XT412003 ), and the Department of Science and Technology of Yunnan Province via the Key Project for the Science and Technology (Grant no. 2011FA001 ).",,02728842,3,"April 1, 2015",English,Catalyst activity,,39.0,4675-4682,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Ceramics International,,Synthesis of mixed Mn-Ce-Oxone dimensional nanostructures and their catalytic activity for CO oxidation,,Catalytic behavior - Catalytic performance - Co oxidation - Hydrothermal methods - Hydrothermal synthesize - One-dimensional nanostructure - Oxygen storage capacity - Transition metal elements,41,
Acta Mech. Solida Sin.,"To compensate for the imperfection of traditional bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization, material interpolation scheme and sensitivity filter functions are introduced. A suitable filter can overcome the checkerboard and mesh-dependency. And the historical information on accurate elemental sensitivity numbers are used to keep the objective function converging steadily. Apart from rational intervals of the relevant important parameters, the concept of distinguishing between active and non-active elements design is proposed, which can be widely used for improving the function and artistry of structures directly, especially for a one whose accurate size is not given. Furthermore, user-friendly software packages are developed to enhance its accessibility for practicing engineers and architects. And to reduce the time cost for large time-consuming complex structure optimization, parallel computing is built-in in the MATLAB codes. The program is easy to use for engineers who may not be familiar with either FEA or structure optimization. And developers can make a deep research on the algorithm by changing the MATLAB codes. Several classical examples are given to show that the improved BESO method is superior for its handy and utility computer program software. © 2015 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.",,,20153601239455,,"Wang, Xianjie (1); Zhang, Xun'An (2); Cheng, Kepeng (2) ","(1) School of Urban Construction and Management, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Mechanics, Civil Engineering and Architecture, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an; 710129, China ",,723.1 Computer Programming - 723.5 Computer Applications - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Computer aided engineering - Evolutionary algorithms - MATLAB - Rational functions - Shape optimization - Topology - Utility programs,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Xianjie(xianjiewang@mail.nwpu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/S0894-9166(15)30028-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18602134,,,,08949166,4,"August 1, 2015",English,Structural optimization,,13.0,431-440,,2015,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica,,Computer program for directed structure topology optimization,,Bi-directional evolutionary structural optimizations - Construction design - Continuum structures - Program development - Structure topology,28,
"HSLA Steels 2015, Microalloying 2015 and Offshore Eng. Steels 2015 Conf. Proc.","The combined addition of molybdenum and niobium is usually applied in fire-resistant steels with appropriate controlled rolling and controlled cooling. In order to develop new alloying strategy based on the advantage of vanadium resource at Panzhihua Iron& steel (group) Co., research on the Vanadium-containing fire-resistant weathering steels are conducted in this paper. Methods such as electron microscope, phase analyzing, tensile test, three dimension atom probe and so on were used to investigate the effect of vanadium on microstructure and tensile properties at both room temperature and high temperature up to 600°C for different processes. The relationship between the microstructure and properties was analyzed. It has been found that the amount of vanadium precipitates would be raised as vanadium content rose. Adding vanadium into the steel was effective to increase the room temperature and elevated temperature yield strength, especially increased the content of nitrogen. Vanadium mainly exists in the pro-eutectoid ferrite of the test steel, the 'hidden' vanadium will precipitate from base microstructure when the temperature elevated to 600°C, simultaneously improve the elevated temperature properties. The alloying strategy of fire-resistant weathering steels at Pangang Steel is ascertained through the experimental work.

Sci. Total Environ.,"This study focused on investigation of the accumulation and distribution of mercury (Hg) in mushrooms of the genus Leccinum that emerged on soils of totally different geochemical bedrock composition. Hg in 6 species from geographically diverse regions of the mercuriferous belt areas in Yunnan of SW China, and 8 species from the non-mercuriferous regions of Poland in Europe was measured. Also assessed was the probable dietary intake of Hg from consumption of Leccinum spp., which are traditional organic food items in SW China and Poland. The results showed that L. chromapes, L. extremiorientale, L. griseum and L. rugosicepes are good accumulators of Hg and the sequestered Hg in caps were up to 4.8, 3.5, 3.6 and 4.7mgHgkg-1dry matter respectively. Leccinum mushrooms from Poland also efficiently accumulated Hg with their average Hg content being an order of magnitude lower due to low concentrations of Hg in forest topsoil of Poland compared to the elevated contents in Yunnan. Consumption of Leccinum mushrooms with elevated Hg contents in Yunnan at rates of up to 300g fresh product per week during the foraging season would not result in Hg intake that exceeds the provisional weekly tolerance limit of 0.004mgkg-1body mass, assuming no Hg ingestion from other foods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20153501226928,,"Falandysz, Jerzy (1); Zhang, Ji (2); Wang, Yuanzhong (2); Krasiska, Grazyna (1); Kojta, Anna (1); Saba, Martyna (1); Shen, Tao (3); Li, Tao (3); Liu, Honggao (4) ","(1) Gdask University, Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, 63 Wita Stwosza Str., Gdask; 80-952, Poland (2) Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming; 650200, China (3) College of Resources and Environment, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi, Yunnan; 653100, China (4) College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China ",STEVA8,461.7 Health Care - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals,,,,,Fungi - Nutrition - Soil pollution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Falandysz, Jerzy(jerzy.falandysz@ug.edu.pl) ",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.159,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18791026,"Number: UMO-2011/03/N/NZ9/04136, Acronym: NCN, Sponsor: Narodowe Centrum Nauki; Number: 31160409, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31260496, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Part of this project was supported by the National Science Centre of Poland ( UMO-2011/03/N/NZ9/04136 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31260496 , 31160409 ).

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"Numerous species of wild-grown mushrooms are among the most vulnerable organisms for contamination with radiocesium released from a radioactive fallout. A comparison was made on radiocesium as well as the natural gamma ray-emitting radionuclide (40K) activity concentrations in the fruiting bodies of several valued edible Boletus mushrooms collected from the region of Europe and Yunnan Province in China. Data available for the first time for Boletus edulis collected in Yunnan, China, showed a very weak contamination with137Cs.

IET Semin Dig,"As HVDC is superior to AC in some aspects, such as transmission capacity, controllability and stability, HVDC has been applied widely around the world. At present, research on recovery path of outage grid mainly focuses on the restarting of thermal power units and hydropower unit, while little attention is paid on the restoration of DC converter station. The restarting of DC converter station needs to meet certain constraints, so common power system restoration schemes are not suitable for power system with DC converter station. In this paper, the requirements for starting the DC converter station are studied. Based on that, a recovery path optimization method of power system with DC converter station is proposed. When selecting the recovery path with critical path method and backtracking method, the objective is to maximize the ratio of power generation during preset time T to recovery time T. To make sure every generator can be restarted in time, the factors considered are start time, start requirements of generators, power flow constraints of the grid and start conditions of DC converter station.

Potential-pH diagrams of V-Fe-H2O, V-Ti-H2O, V-Mn-H2O, V-Cr-H2O system have been calculated at elevated temperature condition (150). The thermodynamics diagrams show that soluble ions of V and Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Cr2+and Cr3+can be extracted by the acidic leachate during the pressure leaching process. The results of orthogonal experiment reveal that the impacts of temperature and initial acid concentration on the vanadium extraction process are effective. The effect of temperature on the leaching process was further investigated with a increased temperature from 100 to 160, and the results indicate that the content of titanium in the residue is 4.56% to about 12.0%, while other elements tend to be enriched in the leaching solution. Under the optimization condition (temperature 140, liquid-solid ratio 10:1|, concentration of acid at 200 g·L-1, stirring speed 500 r/min and the reaction time of 90 min), the leaching rate of vanadium is 96.85%.

Int. J. Remote Sens.,"Land cover exerts considerable control over the exchange of energy, water, and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases between land surface and the atmosphere. In China, dramatic land-cover changes have occurred along with rapid economic development in the past 30 years. However, research specifically on whether such land-cover changes have any influence on root-zone soil moisture in the region has started only in very recent few years. In this study, the performance of selected land-surface models (Noah 2.7.1, Noah 3.2, Common Land Model (CLM version 2.0), and Mosaic) implemented in National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Land Information System (LIS version 6.1.6) is first tested using quality-controlled soil moisture observations from 108 in situ sites of the China Meteorological Administration. The best-performing model (CLM2.0) is selected to estimate the influence of land-cover changes on root-zone soil moisture, as well as drought occurrence in Yunnan Province in China. Both the 1992–1993 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and 2007–2010 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 5 (MODIS) land-cover products at 1 km resolution are employed to represent 1990 and 2010 land-cover status, respectively. These are verified using the local ground records of Yunnan Province over the two time periods. Their differences are considered roughly as land-cover changes occurring during the period 1990–2010. It is found that land-cover changes from primeval forest to grassland may increase root-zone soil moisture, thus reducing drought, while changes from grassland and primeval forest to cropland or reforested areas have increased the likelihood of drought. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,,20154801631879,,"Yin, Jifu (1, 2); Zheng, Youfei (3); Zhan, Xiwu (2); Hain, Christopher R.

Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong,"For solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), an Effective Hybrid Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (EHQEA) was presented. The solution generation method based on two-dimensional Qubit Measurement Model (QMM) and visibility was designed to realize the global search guided by QMM, which was used to find the promising regions over the solution space. An interchange operation based on the distance similar degree between customers was constructed to improve the quality of the solution. The Interchange and Inverse operations based on the problem's property were proposed to construct a two-phase hybrid variable neighborhood local search, which was utilized to execute the fast and meticulous search in the promising regions and helped the algorithm to achieve a balance between the global and local search.

Food Chem.,"This paper introduces a detailed method to apply metabolic profiles conducting on tangerine peels (Citrus reticulata 'Dahongpao') at three maturity stages from July to December. Principal component analysis not only demonstrated the metabolic footprints of tangerine peels during ripening but also revealed the compounds (d-limonene and linalool) that mostly contributed to it. Furthermore, some other characteristic compounds were screened to further reveal the chemical features of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (PCR) and Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae Viride (PCRV). In particular, compounds such as 4-carene (r = -0.94), 3-carene (r = -0.91), β-pinene (r = -0.85) and γ-terpinene (r = -0.87) were screened as major components for the pungent smell of PCRV. Geranyl acetate (r = 0.81), farnesyl acetate (r = 0.87) and three alcohols (6-hepten-1-ol, 3-methyl-1-hexanol, 1-octanol) may lead to the pleasant odour of PCR. We therefore propose that the metabolomics analysis focusing on ripening process will be an effective strategy for quality control of closely related herbal medicines. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.",,,20143600018320,,"Yi, Lunzhao (1); Dong, Naiping (2); Liu, Shao (5); Yi, Zhibiao (3); Zhang, Yi (4) ","(1) Yunnan Food Safety Research Institute, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong; 999077, Hong Kong (3) Dongguan Mathematical and Engineering Academy of Chinese Medicine, GuangZhou University of Chinese Medicine, Dongguan; 523808, China (4) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (5) Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha; 410008, China ",FOCHDJ,804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 822.3 Food Products - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Citrus fruits - Flavors - Indium compounds - Metabolism - Monoterpenes - Principal component analysis - Quality control,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yi, Lunzhao ",10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.07.067,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18737072,"Number: 21105129, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2012108102032, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: JDSJ2013-02, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported financially by National Nature Foundation Committee of P.R.

Clim. Change,"The demand for high-confidence regional climate change scenarios is increasing. It is therefore vitally important to better understand the behavior of Earth’s climate system on regional scale and advance the knowledge of regional responses to global climate. With their ability to represent meso-scale forcings, such as coastline, complex topography, anthropogenic aerosols and land cover/use changes, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are developed and used worldwide to investigate the effects of the above-mentioned meso-scale forcings on the local circulations that regulate the regional distribution of climatic variables. Considering the complexity of Asian Monsoon system, which is not only a physical process but also modulated by the interaction among physical, biological, chemical and social processes, a modeling framework Regional Integrated Environmental Modeling System (RIEMS) was proposed, developed and well tested before it was widely used in regional climate studies in the East Asia monsoon region. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,20143600060033,,"Wang, Shuyu (1, 2); Fu, Congbin (1, 2); Wei, Helin (3); Qian, Yun (4); Xiong, Zhe (2); Feng, Jinming (2); Zhao, Deming (2); Dan, Li (2); Han, Zhiwei (2); Su, Bingkai (1); Zhao, Ming (1); Zhang, Yaocun (1); Tang, Jianping (1); Liu, Hongnian (1); Wu, Jian (5); Zeng, Xinmin (1); Chen, Min (6); Wang, Lizhi (2) ","(1) School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, 22 Hankou Rd., Nanjing; Jiangsu; 210093, China (2) Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment for East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O.

The effects of Al-doping on the crystal structures are systematically evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performance of the cathode material LiAlxMn2-xO4was investigated by galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Results show that doping Al significantly decreases the lattice parameter, changes the micromorphology and improves the electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4. This novel synthesis method will be benefit for the further improvement of the electrochemical performance of cathode materials in lithium cell. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152901032673,6736,"Peng, Cancan (1, 2); Huang, Jijun (1, 2); Guo, Yujiao (1, 2); Li, Qiling (1, 2); Bai, Hongli (1, 2); He, Yonghui (1, 2); Su, Changwei (1, 2); Guo, Junming (1, 2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Comprehensive Utilization of Mineral Resources in Ethnic Regions, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Education Department of Yunnan, School of Chemistry and Environment, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China ",VACUAV,541.1 Aluminum - 642.1 Process Heating - 801 Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Aluminum - Aluminum compounds - Cathodes - Cyclic voltammetry - Doping (additives) - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Glucose - Lithium compounds - Lithium-ion batteries - Manganese compounds - Scanning electron microscopy - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Guo, Junming ",10.1016/j.vacuum.2015.07.001,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2011HC008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014J079, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education; Number: 2013HXSRTY01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014YJY74, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014YJZ10, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program; Number: 2011UY09, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51462036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51262031, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51262031 , 51462036 ), Program for Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in University of Yunnan Province ( 2011UY09 ), Yunnan Provincial Innovation Team ( 2011HC008 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Provincial Education Department ( 2014J079 ), and Innovation Program of Yunnan Minzu University ( 2013HXSRTY01 , 2014YJZ10 , 2014YJY74 ).",,0042207X,PA,"July 14, 2015",English,Combustion synthesis,,35.0,121-126,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Vacuum,,Electrochemical performance of spinel LiAlxMn2-xO4prepared rapidly by glucose-assisted solid-state combustion synthesis,,Cath-ode materials - Electrochemical impedance spectra - Electrochemical performance - Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy - Galvanostatic charge/discharge - Micromorphologies - Spinel LiMn2O4 - Synthesis method,120,
Acta Geophys. Sin.,"Both intensity and aftershock distributions have shown that the seismogenic structure of the 2014 MW6.1 (MS6.5) Ludian, Yunnan, earthquake was quite complex. Especially, aftershocks distribute in a reverse L-shape on conjugated faults (i.e., the NNW-SSE fault and the ENE-WSW fault), making it difficult to determine the causative fault and rupture process. For better understanding the seismogenic structure of the Ludian earthquake, we invert local seismic (strong-motion and broadband data) as well as teleseismic data to investigate the rupture kinematics. Three cases of fault ruptures were tested. (1) Ruptures occur only on the NNW-SSE fault. (2) Ruptures occur only on the ENE-WSW fault. (3) Ruptures can propagate freely on the conjugated faults. A linear technique was used in these inversions. We have two steps in this work. First, local seismic data were inverted for rupture process to identify the rupture faults. Second, with the determined rupture faults, the rupture model was renewed by jointly inverting local seismic and teleseismic waves. Local seismic data inversions show that data fitting of the NNW-SSE fault is better than that of the ENE-WSW fault, suggesting the NNW-SSE fault is the major rupture fault of the Ludian earthquake. Meanwhile, the best data fitting was found in inversion of conjugated faults, in which data fitting per seismic moment of the ENE-WSW fault was even slightly better than that of the NNW-SSE fault, indicating that both conjugated faults may have ruptured during the earthquake. From the joint inversion of local and teleseismic data, rupture initiated on the ENE-WSW fault in the first two seconds, and after 2 s, the NNW-SSE fault began to rupture. The source duration is about 17 s, but most seismic moments were released in the first 10 s after the rupture initiation. On the conjugated faults, ruptures propagated toward up-dip directions and mainly occurred in very shallow depth, which may account for the terrible earthquake damages. However, rupture extent of the NNW-SSE fault is much larger than that of the ENE-WSW fault. As a result, rupture area on the NNW-SSE fault is comparable with aftershocks along that direction, but on the ENE-WSW fault, the dimension of rupture area is much smaller than that of aftershock distribution. The above inversion results show that the Ludian earthquake is a complex conjugated ruptured earthquake. Ruptures firstly initiated on the ENE-WSW fault, and then triggered the NNW-SSE fault. Consecutive ruptures on conjugated faults constitute the complex rupture process of the earthquake. The left-lateral strike-slips in the south of the NNW-SSE fault could unlock the west part of the ENE-WSW fault, leading to aftershocks in that area where no significant ruptures were observed. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Kong Zhi Li Lun Yu Ying Yong,"We propose a meta-heuristic intelligent optimization algorithm named as multivariant optimization algorithm, in which intelligent searchers have specific and defined roles in cooperation. To obtain the global optimal solution gradually, we search the solution space through alternate iterations of global exploration and local exploitation. According to different responsibilities, the searchers (atoms) can be divided into two kinds: the global atoms and the local ones. The global atoms explore the whole solution space to locate the potential areas rapidly. The local atoms exploit each potential area to improve the quality of the solution found by the global atom. The algorithm has two characters: on the one hand, the search strategy with clear division of responsibilities eliminates the need of balancing global exploration and local exploitation, which helps the global exploration to escape from local traps while ensuring the local exploitation. On the other hand, the alternate iterations of global exploration and local exploitation guarantee the asymptotic behavior of algorithm. The asymptotic property of multivariant optimization algorithm is proved theoretically. Extensive comparisons with some outstanding evolutionary algorithms are carried out based on eight complex multi-modal benchmark functions. Results show that this multivariant optimization algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms in asymptotic property. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology.

Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao,"To verify the performance of buckling restrained braces (BRB) in reducing the seismic response, the shaking table tests were carried out on two 1/5 scaled models of reinforced concrete frame structures, which were equipped and unequipped with BRB respectively. The dynamic characteristics, damping ratio, seismic response characteristics of model structure and the energy dissipation capacity of BRB were researched. The test results show that: the structure unequipped with BRB fail to achieve the 'three level' seismic target. In contrast, the structure equipped with BRB fail in a preferred pattern, where the seismic response is diminished effectively and the maximum reduction rate of displacement reaches 97%; under frequent earthquake, BRB can provide the structure with lateral stiffness, and share up to 34%-49% of the total shear force. Under medium and rare earthquakes, BRB provides the model structure with damping by its yield deformation, and dissipates 25%-51% of the total energy. The test results also show that, different kinds of BRB have a great difference for performance after earthquakes. The failure mechanism of the structural system with BRB is that BRB is broken first, and then the beam and column fail. ©, 2015, Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao/Journal of Building Structures.

Hydrol. Res.,"The Xishuangbanna (SW China) landscape has changed dramatically during the past three decades due to the conversion of tropical rainforest to rubber plantations. This study characterized the influence of conversion of tropical rainforest to rubber plantation on potential splash erosion rate and actual splash erosion rate. The average potential splash erosion rate was 2.1 times higher in the rubber plantation than in the open, while for the rainforest it was only 1.2 times higher than in the open, suggesting that the rubber plantation canopy greatly increased the rainsplash erosion. The average actual splash erosion rate was 2.0 times higher in the rubber plantation than in the rainforest, demonstrating that the rainforest was more effective in controlling splash erosion. The actual splash erosion rate was considerably lower in the terrace bench than in the riser bank in the rubber plantation, indicating that the riser bank was more sensitive to raindrop splash. Hence, protection of terrace risers with productive vegetation or litter/mulch layer is of vital importance in this bench-terraced rubber plantation. These results clearly show that conversion of tropical rainforest to rubber plantation had a negative effect on controlling splash erosion. © IWA Publishing 2015.",,,20151500738468,,"Liu, Wenjie (1); Luo, Qinpu (2); Li, Jintao (3); Wang, Pingyuan (1); Lu, Hongjian (4); Liu, Wenyao (1); Li, Hongmei (1) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Tropical Forest Ecology, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun; Yunnan Province; 666303, China (2) College of Resources Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing; 100875, China (3) Dehong Institute of Tropical Agriculture Sciences, Ruili; Yunnan; 678600, China (4) Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China ",,443 Meteorology - 818.1 Natural Rubber,,,,,Erosion - Rubber - Tropics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Wenjie(lwj6932002@aliyun.com) ",10.2166/nh.2013.109,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),22247955,,,,19989563,1,2015,English,Rubber plantations,,28.0,168-174,,2015,Nordic Association for Hydrology,Hydrology Research,,"The effects of conversion of tropical rainforest to rubber plantation on splash erosion in Xishuangbanna, SW China",,Average potential - On potentials - Soil erosion - Splash erosion - Tropical rain forest - Xishuangbanna,46,
ISPRS J. Photogramm. Remote Sens.,"Knowledge of the area and spatial distribution of paddy rice is important for assessment of food security, management of water resources, and estimation of greenhouse gas (methane) emissions. Paddy rice agriculture has expanded rapidly in northeastern China in the last decade, but there are no updated maps of paddy rice fields in the region. Existing algorithms for identifying paddy rice fields are based on the unique physical features of paddy rice during the flooding and transplanting phases and use vegetation indices that are sensitive to the dynamics of the canopy and surface water content. However, the flooding phenomena in high latitude area could also be from spring snowmelt flooding. We used land surface temperature (LST) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to determine the temporal window of flooding and rice transplantation over a year to improve the existing phenology-based approach. Other land cover types (e.g., evergreen vegetation, permanent water bodies, and sparse vegetation) with potential influences on paddy rice identification were removed (masked out) due to their different temporal profiles. The accuracy assessment using high-resolution images showed that the resultant MODIS-derived paddy rice map of northeastern China in 2010 had a high accuracy (producer and user accuracies of 92% and 96%, respectively). The MODIS-based map also had a comparable accuracy to the 2010 Landsat-based National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) of China in terms of both area and spatial pattern. This study demonstrated that our improved algorithm by using both thermal and optical MODIS data, provides a robust, simple and automated approach to identify and map paddy rice fields in temperate and cold temperate zones, the northern frontier of rice planting. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Electron. J. Geotech. Eng.,"The mechanical behavior of hydrate-bearing coal has relevance for the coal and gas outburst prevention. This study reports on the results of triaxial compression tests on methane hydrate bearing coal. The results show that the stress-strain relationships depend closely on the confining pressure. The failure strength linearly varies with the saturation. The higher the hydrate saturation is, the larger the internal friction angle is. The cementation between the coal and hydrate increases apparently when the saturation is high enough. The mechanical behavior of coal is improved after hydrate formation in the aspects of failure strength and the deformation elastic modulus. © 2015 ejge.",,,20151300682134,,"Gao, X. (1); Gao, C.

Guangdianzi Jiguang,"Particle image velocimetry (PIV) method, which has been widely applied in flow field testing in recent years, is a flow measurement technique using laser imaging technology. XFD floatation machines are most frequently used in floatation experiments. Research on their characteristics of flow fields can provide basic data for floatation-machine design and promote design level of floatation machine. In this paper, related experiments have been performed on investigating flow field in XFD-1.5L floatation machine to reveal its characteristics by PIV method. When agitation speed of the floatation machine is set at 1000 r/min, three planes (10-10, 20-20 and 30-30) in the stirring tank are illuminated by laser and studied. As a result, the main characteristics can be described as follows: the fluid circuits from stirring tank to the chute; the main cell consists of three zones, which are the zone between Y=0~25 mm mainly with horizontal circulating flow, the zone between Y=25~120 mm mainly with rising flow and the zone between Y=120~145 mm mainly with horizontal flow moving towards the chute, corresponding to stirring zone, separating zone and froth zone described by floatation theory, respectively. The results suggest that the design of the floatation machine is rational and can facilitate mineral separation. ©, 2015, Board of Optronics Lasers.

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"Due to the serious trend of water pollution across the country, the problem of aquaculture wastewater discharge must be solved appropriately to achieve sustainability. As a novel technology for sewage treatment, constructed wetland (CW) has been gradually expanded to aquaculture. In view of the disadvantages in land dispute with pond aquaculture, how to develop or design a land-saving, high-efficiency CW will be the focus of future study. It is widely accepted that artificial aeration can enhance the purification efficiency of CW's subsurface flow on wastewater due to its capacity to improve the oxidation conditions, which is beneficial for organic matter degradation and nutrient removal. Nevertheless, more detailed studies on the impact of aeration intensity on treatment performance and the associated relationships with influencing factors are still lacking. In the present study, 7 pilot-scale vertical-flow CWs with different combinations of substrates and plants were configured and then systematically investigated in field for treating low-strength aquaculture wastewater with or without artificial aeration. An attempt to explore the impact of the aeration on nitrogen (N) removal or transformation within wetland bed was made. After a thorough comparison between aerated and non-aerated states investigated simultaneously or by stages, the results were depicted as follows: under the operating conditions characterized by high hydraulic loading(HLR) (mean value 1.85 m/d), short hydraulic retention time(HRT) (mean 4.6 h), strong aeration intensity (air flow rate 30 m3/(m2·d), air-water ratio 16.2:1) and low inflow dissolved oxygen (DO) (mean 2.34 mg/L), nitrification occurred obviously within all the systems no matter with or without aeration. DO replenished from atmospheric reoxygenation and plant roots appeared enough to cover the quantity consumed by nitrification and organic matter degradation. Artificial aeration enhanced the intensity of internal mineralization and nitrification. In virtue of no lack of available carbon source (for instance in the present case, the influent ratio of chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen (COD/N) ranged from 28.4 to 30.6), the probability for denitrification under the aerated state increased compared to the non-aerated state, which finally led to the elevation of purification performance on total N (TN). Nevertheless, if too much DO was presented under the aerated state, denitrification would further be restrained, which would conversely lead to the reduction of removal efficiency on TN. Therefore, for complete-drain vertical-flow systems, it is not the truth that the higher aeration intensity is, the better efficacy will be obtained. To obtain higher stable purification efficiency, a good suggestion is decreasing HLR or extending HRT or supplementing horizontal flows to vertical-flow systems to ensure complete denitrification. That strategy will be especially beneficial for TN removal. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Plant J.,"The family Euphorbiaceae includes some of the most efficient biomass accumulators. Whole genome sequencing and the development of genetic maps of these species are important components in molecular breeding and genetic improvement. Here we report the draft genome of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.), a biodiesel plant. The assembled genome has a total length of 320.5 Mbp and contains 27 172 putative protein-coding genes. We established a linkage map containing 1208 markers and anchored the genome assembly (81.7%) to this map to produce 11 pseudochromosomes. After gene family clustering, 15 268 families were identified, of which 13 887 existed in the castor bean genome. Analysis of the genome highlighted specific expansion and contraction of a number of gene families during the evolution of this species, including the ribosome-inactivating proteins and oil biosynthesis pathway enzymes. The genomic sequence and linkage map provide a valuable resource not only for fundamental and applied research on physic nut but also for evolutionary and comparative genomics analysis, particularly in the Euphorbiaceae.

Phys.,"Two relatively modern analysis techniques, including the empirical mode decomposition and Morlet wavelet transform, are combined to investigate the short- and mid-term periodicities of daily coronal index from 1 January 1939 to 31 December 2008. Apart from the well-known periodicities of annual-oscillation variation, 11-year Schwabe cycle, 17-year full-disk activity cycle and 22-year magnetic cycle, the combined procedure reveals a variety of mid-term quasi-periodicities (MTQPs) in this solar-activity indicator, especially the periodicities near the 1.3 and 1.7 years. The prominent results show the followings: (1) the synodic rotation periodicities of 26 and 29 days correspond to the two principal components (the fast and slow types) of differential rotation in the solar corona; (2) the Rieger-type periodicity near 150 days is not found in time series of coronal index, which may be due to the intermittent character of its quasi-periodic pattern; (3) the MTQPs with a shorter periodicity around 1.3 years and a longer one around 1.7 years indeed exist in the solar coronal region. Our analysis results suggest that the coronal dynamics should be a connecting agent among the oscillations in the tachocline layer (Howe et al., 2000), in the lower atmospheric layers ( Krivova and Solanki, 2002) and in the interplanetary space (Mursula and Vilppola, 2004). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20144800266080,,"Deng, L.H.

Guangxue Xuebao,"An important scientific task of new vacuum solar telescope (NVST) is to obtain the middle and lower magnetic field of solar by accurate polarization measurement. In order to achieve high precision and high efficiency systematic polarization calibration, it is needed to build a polarization model for the telescope. This article analyzes the telescope instrumental polarization changes of coude optical path over days and seasons, and birefringence effects of its vacuum window. The result shows: the main crosstalk of Coude optical path is between linear polarization and circuit polarization, whose maximum number is 0.7. In the meantime, when the sun approaches midheaven around the summer solstice, the curve of crosstalk becomes shocked since dramatic derotation. And the total polarization property of vacuum window is equivalent to a retarder which changes along with the altitude of telescope. It becomes obvious when the telescope points are horizontal and the crosstalk increases to 1.2 × 10-2. ©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

Environ. Pollut.,"Sorption of organic contaminants on organo-mineral complexes has been investigated extensively, but the sorption contribution of mineral particles was not properly addressed before calculating KOC, especially for ionic organic contaminants. We measured the surface coverage of a humic acid (HA) on nano iron oxides (n-Fe2O3) in a series of synthesized organo-mineral complexes. The contribution of the coated HA to ofloxacin (OFL) and norfloxacin (NOR) sorption in HA-n-Fe2O3complexes was over 80% of the total sorption with the surface coverage of 36% and fOCof 1.6%. All the coated HA showed higher sorption to NOR and OFL in comparison to the original HA, suggesting HA fractionation and/or physical re-conformation during organo-mineral complex formation. The decreased KOCwith multilayer coating may suggest the importance of site-specific interactions for OFL sorption, while the increased KOCwith multilayer coating may suggest the importance of partitioning in hydrophobic region for NOR sorption. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Environ. Earth Sci.,"To determine the ammonia nitrogen adsorption and release characteristics of surface sediments in Dianchi Lake, 36 surface sediment (0–10 cm) samples were collected in 2013. Results showed that compared with other lakes in China (e.g. Erhai Lake and Taihu Lake), Dianchi Lake had high levels of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+–N) adsorption capacity, release rate and release capacity. The ammonia nitrogen release risk of Dianchi sediments was relatively high. Comparison of the equilibrium ammonium concentration (ENC0) in surface sediments and the ammonium contents in the overlying water of Dianchi Lake indicated that ENC0was high for most lake sections. Therefore, the sediments of Dianchi Lake would be a pollution source, and ammonia nitrogen release risk was high because the surface sediments of Dianchi Lake were heavily contaminated with nitrogen. The total nitrogen (TN) and NH4+–N contents of the sediments of Dianchi Lake greatly influenced the ammonia nitrogen adsorption–release process. Aside from TN, nitrogen fractions should also be studied when assessing pollutant release risk from lake sediments. NH4+–N was the main fraction of nitrogen released from sediments, which was highly significant when evaluating sedimentary release capacity. The sedimentary release capacity and release potential of nitrogen provided important information to assess release risks. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20153201157649,,"He, Jia (1, 2); Deng, Weiming (2); Chen, Chunyu (2); Xu, Xiaomei (2); Wang, Shengrui (3); Liu, Wenbin (3); Wu, Xue (2) ","(1) College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing; 100875, China (2) Kunming Institute of Environmental Science, Kunming; Yunnan; 650032, China (3) Chinese Research Academy of Environment Sciences, Beijing; 100012, China ",,453 Water Pollution - 481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,,,,,Ammonia - Lake pollution - Lakes - Nitrogen - Risk assessment - Sedimentology - Surficial sediments,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Xiaomei(25472087@qq.com) ",10.1007/s12665-015-4724-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18666299,,,,18666280,5,"October 1, 2015",English,Gas adsorption,,27.0,3917-3927,,2015,Springer Verlag,Environmental Earth Sciences,,"Ammonia nitrogen adsorption and release characteristics of surface sediments in Dianchi Lake, China",,Adsorption capacities - Ammonia nitrogen - Ammonium concentrations - Dianchi lakes - Nitrogen fraction - Pollutant release - Release characteristics - Surface sediments,74,
Biotechnol. Bioprocess Eng.,"This study uses microbial methods to research the influence of oxygen (O2) content on the removal efficiency of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in a tandem twin-towers desulfurization and denitrification process system. Oxygen can play a significant role in biotrickling towers. Other important factors had already been optimized prior to the study, including inlet concentration, gas flow rate, and temperature. SO2and NOxwere prepared by a chemical method. A gas flow meter was used to regulate nitrogen (N2) that had been stored in steel cylinders. In this way, the O2content was adjusted in the biotrickling towers by controlling the N2flow rate. Five gradients of O2content were selected for investigation, namely 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20%. Results indicated that the SO2removal efficiency from mixed gas (SO2and NOx) can reach 100%, from all of the five O2gradients, in biotrickling towers. In a tandem twin-towers desulfurization and denitrification process system, the NOxremoval efficiency and the inlet concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gradually increased as the O2content increased. Specifically, the average removal efficiency of NOxincreased from 49.28 to 80.85% as the O2content changed from 4 to 20%. The oxygen levels influenced the removal of NOxbut the SO2removal efficiency in mixed gas was always stable. © 2015, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20154801619419,,"Wang, Xing Chun (1); Bi, Xiao Yi (1, 2); Sun, Pei Shi (1); Chen, Jin Quan (1); Zou, Ping (1); Ma, Xiao Ming (1); Zhang, Jing (1); Wang, Hai Yu (1); Xu, Xiao Yi (3) ","(1) Research Institute of Engineering and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650-091, China (2) Asian International River Centre, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650-091, China (3) Yunnan Finance and Trade University, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Kunming; 650-221, China ",,402.4 Towers - 631.1.2 Gas Dynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Biofilters - Denitrification - Desulfurization - Efficiency - Flow of gases - Nitrogen oxides - Oxygen - Sulfur dioxide - Towers,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bi, Xiao Yi(bixiaoyi@126.com) ",10.1007/s12257-015-0138-5,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19763816,,,,12268372,5,"September 1, 2015",English,Nitrogen removal,,31.0,924-930,,2015,Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering,Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering,,Effects of oxygen content on the simultaneous microbial removal of SO2and NOxin biotrickling towers,,Bio-trickling filters - Desulfurization and denitrifications - Influence of oxygen - Inlet concentration - Nitrogen dioxides - NOx removal efficiency - Oxygen content - Removal efficiencies,20,
Bio-Med. Mater. Eng.,"To discuss the differences in protein expression among tuberculosis pleural effusion (TBPE), malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and transudative pleural effusion (TSPE). We recruited 50 patients with pleural effusion, including 20 TBPEs, 17 MPEs and 13 TSPEs. Using the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), we acquired the peptide mass finger printings (PMFs) of featured proteins. Then, we identified characteristic proteins by searching in the protein databank of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and assessed their diagnostic significance. We found five characteristic proteins: C1-inhibitor (C1-INH), transthyretin (TTR), human complement fragment 3b (C3b), human ceruloplasmin (CP), and Z34c protein fragment Fc (Z34c-Fc). C1-INH shows a high expression in TBPE and a low expression in MPE while TTR and C3 show low expression in TBPE and high expressions in MPE. Z34c-Fc and CP have a higher expression in TBPE than in TSPE. No common characteristic protein was found between MPE and TSPE.

RSC Adv.,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) usually contains one specific class of components that could represent its phytochemical properties and therapeutic effects. However, the unclear specific class constituents hinders the sufficient interpretation of its bioactivities. In this paper, an HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-based strategy focused on the TCM targeted class was developed. This strategy was successfully applied in the discovery and identification of phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) in Herba Cistanches, and herbomics research of Cistanche deserticola, C. sinensis, and C. tubulosa. A total of 69 PhGs, including 17 new PhGs, were rapidly discovered and characterized using multiple data-mining methods such as accurate parent mass search, parent mass modification search and fragment ion search, allowing a comprehensive revelation of PhGs in Cistanche species for the first time. Based on the peak areas of the 69 PhGs identified, multivariate statistical analysis such as PCA, loading analysis and OPLS-DA were employed in herbomics research to screen and validate the PhGs that could be utilized to discriminate these three Cistanche species. Eight PhGs were finally screened and chosen as chemical markers for the species discrimination. In conclusion, this new established strategy could be exemplary for future studies on the discovery and identification of important chemical constituents, and differentiation of genuine specie or genus from adulterants. Meanwhile, it may propose a novel idea for analyzing a specific class of active chemical constituents, and is promising for quality control and evaluation of TCMs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20153901313793,,"Zhang, Jiayu (1); Li, Chen (2); Che, Yanyun (3); Wu, Jiarui (1); Wang, Zijian (1); Cai, Wei (1); Li, Yun (1); Ma, Zhiguo (4); Tu, Pengfei (1) ","(1) Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing; 100029, China (2) Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai; 201206, China (3) Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming; 650500, China (4) College of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou; 510632, China ",RSCACL,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 922 Statistical Methods,,,,,Chemical analysis - Data mining - Medicine - Multivariant analysis - Sugars,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ma, Zhiguo(pengfeitu@vip.163.com) ",10.1039/c5ra13276b,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,98,"September 16, 2015",English,Quality control,,36.0,80816-80828,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,"LTQ-Orbitrap-based strategy for traditional Chinese medicine targeted class discovery, identification and herbomics research: A case study on phenylethanoid glycosides in three different species of Herba Cistanches",,Chemical constituents - Chemical markers - Cistanche deserticola - Mass modifications - Multivariate statistical analysis - Phenylethanoid glycosides - Therapeutic effects - Traditional Chinese Medicine,5,

Int. J. Environ. Anal. Chem.,"Fe3O4nanoparticles coated with SiO2and modified with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate as a new adsorbent for the single-step extraction and preconcentration of trace amounts of copper and nickel from tobacco samples were prepared. The particle sizes of nanoparticles were characterised by transmission electron microscope. Several parameters affecting the analytical performance, such as the amount of ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, amount of magnetic nanoparticles, pH, contact time, coexisting ions, desorption solution and reuse times of magnetic solid-phase extraction, were discussed and optimised. The analytes desorbed from magnetic nanoparticles were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Under the optimum conditions, the analytical linear ranges were 0.02–15 mg/L for Cu and 0.02–20 mg/L for Ni (R2 > 0.9992). The relative standard deviations (RSDs, n = 5) of 1.8% and 2.1% were obtained for Cu and Ni, respectively. The method detection limits were 0.0028 μg/g for Cu and 0.0037 μg/g for Ni. The proposed method was successfully applied to tobacco sample analysis and got excellent recoveries in the range of 89.6–102.3% and RSDs (n = 5) of 1.2–2.5%.

IET Conf Publ,"With new energy requirements increase in power market environment, wind power development has played a very significant role in renewable energy area for improving the energy structure, climate change and energy security issues. The dispatching of grid-connected wind turbines impacts the stability of the power system to a large degree. In recent years, there are many wind power dispatching studies which based on power forecasting. This paper, different from those studies, do not focus on the wind resources, but the fatigue character of turbines. According to the discussion of several multiracial fatigue theories and the competition of several common fatigue damage cumulative rules, the most appropriate failure method for the key parts of wind turbine was gotten. By using the software of Bladed, the model of wind generator was simulated and the time history of fatigue load was gotten. The fatigue load spectrum was gotten by using rain-flow counting method.

Crit. Rev. Environ. Sci. Technol.,"There has been an intense debate about climatic impacts on the transmission of malaria. It is vitally important to accurately project future impacts of climate change on malaria to support effective policy-making and intervention activity concerning malaria control and prevention. This paper critically reviewed the published literature and examined both key findings and methodological issues in projecting future impacts of climate change on malaria transmission. A literature search was conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and PubMed. The projected impacts of climate change on malaria transmission were spatially heterogeneous and somewhat inconsistent. The variation in results may be explained by the interaction of climatic factors and malaria transmission cycles, variations in projection frameworks, and uncertainties of future socioecological (including climate) changes. Current knowledge gaps are identified, future research directions are proposed, and public health implications are assessed. Improving the understanding of the dynamic effects of climate on malaria transmission cycles, the advancement of modeling techniques and the incorporation of uncertainties in future socioecological changes are critical factors for projecting the impact of climate change on malaria transmission.

Appl Surf Sci,"Diverse morphologies of porous CuO were fabricated using surfactant as soft template via a solution combustion method. It is found that a mixture of glycine and ethylene glycol (EG) (1:1) is much more favorable than individual fuel for the fabrication of CuO. All as-synthesized products are surfactant indispensable monoclinic CuO phase. The CuO synthesized without any surfactant is foam network, however, it evolves into basic flake-like morphology with different pores and assembling microstructures in the presence of surfactant.

Hsi An Chiao Tung Ta Hsueh,"For an oil-immersed transformer core and pancake windings, the transformer vibration parameters are sought out and the vibration superposition is analyzed. The vibration monitoring system with piezoelectric vibration acceleration sensors is constructed and a series of experiments for the influence factors of the transformer vibration, such as current, power factor, unbalance factor and oil temperature, are conducted to investigate the vibration characteristics under different working conditions. It is found that the fundamental component of transformer tank under the greatest tapping is higher than that under principal tapping, transformer tank does not vibrate at linear superposition frequencies of core and windings; the fundamental component of transformer tank grows with the power factor; frequency components of 50 Hz, 150 Hz and 250 Hz appear in the vibration signals of power transformer due to the asymmetry. The experiments show that the fundamental component of the transformer vibration signal increases linearly with the oil temperature; temperature coefficient stays within 0.005-0.035 and does not depend upon the transformer capacity. ©, 2015, Xi'an Jiaotong University.

Quat. Res.,"14C dating of shoreline deposits of closed-basin lake Baqan Tso in the western Tibetan Plateau shows that lake level regressed from the undated highstand (46m above modern, 4.3× modern surface area) of likely earliest Holocene age by 11.5ka, and remained larger than modern until at least ≈5.0ka. The shoreline record broadly matches other regional climate records, with lake level closely following Northern Hemisphere summer insolation overprinted by sub-millennial lake-level oscillations. A model coupling modern land runoff and lake surface heat closely reproduces estimated modern precipitation of ≈240mm/yr. We estimate that the Baqan Tso basin required ≈380mm/yr precipitation to sustain the maximum early Holocene lake area, a 55% increase over modern. Precipitation increases, not glacial meltwater, drove lake-level changes, as Baqan Tso basin was not glaciated during the Holocene. Our estimate assumes early Holocene insolation (≈1.3% overall increase), and mean annual increases of 2°C in temperature, and 37% in relative humidity. We additionally developed a Holocene precipitation history for Baqan Tso using dated paleolake areas. Using the modern and early Holocene model results as end-members, we estimate precipitation in the western Tibetan Plateau which was 300-380mm/yr between 5.0 and 11.5ka, with error of ±29-57mm/yr (±12-15%). © 2014 University of Washington.",,,20150300425424,,"Huth, Tyler (1); Hudson, Adam M.

RSC Adv.,"A methodology has been developed to obtain a cubic structure of the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClxthat involves thermal annealing of a vacuum-deposited perovskite layer. In this process, a tetragonal-cubic transition of the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClxhas been observed using a variety of characterization techniques, e.g., X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical and Hall effect measurements. According to the XRD, the tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3-xClxchanged into the cubic phase when the temperature increased to above the transition temperature, at which point all iodine atoms move towards the central axis while PbI6rotates around the C-N bond. After annealing, the stable cubic structure of the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-xClxhas a smaller band gap and a better optical absorption than the original tetragonal structure. Meanwhile, the microstructure has shown an increase of grain size after annealing, which could be given the fastest mobility of 13.5 cm2V-1S-1, yielded from the Hall effect measurements.

However, because the nodes are usually connected via certain wireless technology and the nodes may change their locations from time to time, the connections between devices are usually unstable and the applications offloaded may fail. In order to guarantee the users to be able to continue the applications offloaded seamlessly regardless of the mobility of the nodes, in this paper, the extended versions of the traditional Minimum Execution Time heuristic and the Minimum Completion Time heuristic, and a mobility prediction based offloading heuristic, were proposed to solve the mobility problem in mobile device clouds. Their performances were investigated via simulation. It's shown that, with the help of mobility prediction, the DynPredict heuristic can lead to lower average reschedule time, lower average failure rate and shorter response time. © 2014 IEEE.",,,20151200670732,7023671.0,"Li, Bo (1); Liu, Zhi (1); Pei, Yijian (1); Wu, Hao (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,"461.4 Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering - 716 Telecommunication; Radar, Radio and Television - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems",110486.0,"December 19, 2014 - December 21, 2014","Chengdu, China","17th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, CSE 2014 - Jointly with 13th IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications, IUCC 2014, 13th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks, I-SPAN 2014 and 8th International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology, FCST 2014",Failure analysis - Forecasting - Mobile cloud computing - Mobile devices - Wireless telecommunication systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/CSE.2014.161,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479979813.0,,,"January 26, 2015",English,Ubiquitous computing,,20.0,786-792,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 17th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, CSE 2014, Jointly with 13th IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications, IUCC 2014, 13th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks, I-SPAN 2014 and 8th International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology, FCST 2014",IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC),Mobility prediction based opportunistic computational offloading for mobile device cloud,,Computation intensives - Computational Offloading - Extended versions - Minimum completion time - Mobile clouds - Mobility predictions - Resourceconstrained devices - Wireless technologies,,

In this report, detailed studies were especially focused on the width of the extruding dies mouth and leakage gap which influenced on the metal deformation, then the stress and strain distribution and contact force distribution of arbitrary step were obtained with respect to different technical parameters among random steps. Furthermore, the relationship between the parameters of ?h and W/H was given, indicating that the intense internal Shear Band-IISB and leak gap affect the metal forming behavior, and enlarge obviously plastic deformation zone in a certain range. Consequently, it's proper to be helpful for metal homogeneous deformation to reduce the entrance width of the extruding mold. © 2015.

Int J Intell Syst,"Clustering a group of large-scale time series with the same length is a frequently met problem in real world. However, the existing clustering methods often show high computational cost and low efficiency when dealing with this problem. In this paper, we propose a granulation-based horizontal collaborative fuzzy clustering method for this problem. In this method, some new subgroups are built from the given large-scale time series group by segmenting all the time series with time alignment. Thus, all the subsequences in each subgroup have the same length, which are much smaller than the length of the original time series. Just because of the smaller length, the clustering of all subsequences in each subgroup can be easily carried out with lower computation cost and higher efficiency. How to aggregate the clustering results of all subgroups to obtain the clustering result of the given group of large-scale time series becomes the main task of this paper. To solve this problem, we carry out the horizontal collaborative fuzzy clustering on the last subgroup by collaborating the clustering information of the previous subgroups. To obtain much better performance, we first perform fuzzy information granulation on the original group of large-scale time series. After that, the original group of time series is transformed into a group of granular time series. Therefore, the collaborative clustering is carried out on the corresponding granular subgroups. Simulation experiments presented here illustrate the good performance of the algorithm of our method. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,20151600767699,,"Wang, Xiao (1); Yu, Fusheng (2); Zhang, Huixin (3); Liu, Shihu (4); Wang, Jiayin (2) ","(1) School of Information Engineering, Shandong Youth University of Political Science, Jinan; 250103, China (2) School of Mathematical Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Ministry of Education, Beijing; 100875, China (3) School of Statistics, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing; 100070, China (4) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming; 650031, China ",IJISED,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis - 913.1 Production Engineering - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,Cluster analysis - Clustering algorithms - Computational efficiency - Efficiency - Fuzzy clustering - Granulation - Problem solving,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Fusheng(yufusheng@263.net) ",10.1002/int.21726,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1098111X,,,,08848173,6,"June 1, 2015",English,Time series,,25.0,763-780,,2015,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, United Kingdom",International Journal of Intelligent Systems,,Large-scale time series clustering based on fuzzy granulation and collaboration,,Clustering information - Clustering results - Collaborative clustering - Computational costs - Fuzzy clustering method - Fuzzy information granulation - Granular time series - Large-scale time series,30,
Rock Soil Mech,"By summarizing the bond granule tests, a A contact model for rock is established and imbedded into a DEM software by summarizing the bond granule tests. Then DEM simulation of uniaxial compression test on the pre-cracked rock of Lac du Bonnet granite was is carried outperformed, and then the stress distributions of stress in the sample iasre further analyzed and compared with the theoretical results. Different fracture criteria are used employed to predict the crack initiation angles and that are compared with the theoretical ones. The results show that the failure modes obtained from the DEM simulation are similar both in the DEM simulation and to experimental results, and. The stress distributions in DEM simulation are qualitatively similar to the theoretical resultsvalues. When the angle of pre-crack is small, the lateral stresses are compressive and tensile. The compressive strains concentrate in theat two edges, which resulting in the tensile strains in the up- and downward cracks. When the angle of the pre-crack is large enough, the stress concentration is not unobvious,, leading to a discrepancy between the DEM and theoretical results. The crack extension angle resulting from uniaxial compression measured from DEM tests are in good agreement with those obtained acquired from laboratory experimental tests. These angles are consistent with theoretical predictions by the maximum circumferential stress criterion and the maximum energy release rate criterion. © 2015, Academia Sinica.

J Alloys Compd,"Abstract Microalloys of platinum containing 0.3 or 0.5 wt% titanium (Pt-0.3Ti and Pt-0.5Ti, respectively) were studied to determine their solid solution hardening, age hardening, work hardening, and annealing softening behavior. The obtained results revealed that the solid solution hardening and work hardening effects are both quite significant. The quenching hardness (114 HV), processing hardness (202 HV with 90% rolling), and annealing hardness (130 HV after 1 h at 800°C) of the Pt-0.5Ti microalloy are 1.7, 2.0, and 2.6 times greater, respectively, than that of pure Pt.

ISPRS J. Photogramm. Remote Sens.,"Forests and their changes are important to the regional and global carbon cycle, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Some uncertainty about forest cover area in China calls for an accurate and updated forest cover map. In this study, we combined ALOS PALSAR orthorectified 50-m mosaic images (FBD mode with HH and HV polarization) and MODIS time series data in 2010 to map forests in China. We used MODIS-based NDVI dataset (MOD13Q1, 250-m spatial resolution) to generate a map of annual maximum NDVI and used it to mask out built-up lands, barren lands, and sparsely vegetated lands. We developed a decision tree classification algorithm to identify forest and non-forest land cover, based on the signature analysis of PALSAR backscatter coefficient data. The PALSAR-based algorithm was then applied to produce a forest cover map in China in 2010. The resulting forest/non-forest classification map has an overall accuracy of 96.2% and a Kappa Coefficient of 0.91. The resultant 50-m PALSAR-based forest cover map was compared to five forest cover databases. The total forest area (2.02×106km2) in China from the PALSAR-based forest map is close to the forest area estimates from China National Forestry Inventory (1.95×106km2), JAXA (2.00×106km2), and FAO FRA (2.07×106km2). There are good linear relationships between the PALSAR-based forest map and the forest maps from the JAXA, MCD12Q1, and NLCD-China datasets at the province and county scales. All the forest maps have similar spatial distributions of forest/non-forest at pixel scale. Our PALSAR-based forest map recognizes well the agro-forests in China. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of integrating PALSAR and MODIS images to map forests in large areas. The resultant map of forest cover in China in 2010 can be used for many studies such as forest carbon cycle and ecological restoration. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol.,"In order to explore the growth inhibition and physiological responses of unicellular and colonial Microcystis aeruginosa during coexistence with Acorus calamus, algal densities, chlorophyll a contents, exopolysaccharide (EPS) concentrations, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, catalase (CAT) activities, and peroxidase (POD) activities of the two algae strains were analyzed. Although the unicellular and colonial strains of M. aeruginosa were both inhibited by A. calamus, unicellular algae were more sensitive than the colonial algae. The measurement results for EPS, MDA, CAT, and POD showed that unicellular M. aeruginosa had higher levels of stress related damage than colonial strains when they were exposed to the same density of A. calamus, and the cellular defense system of colonial M. aeruginosa was stronger than that of unicellular M. aeruginosa. Natural blooms of Microcystis are typically composed of colonial forms of M. aeruginosa, therefore future efforts to control such blooms, possibly through the development of new algicides, should focus on the unique characteristics of colonial M. aeruginosa strains. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.",,,20144800248154,,"Zhang, S.-H.

Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan,"Cloud data processing plays an essential infrastructure in cloud systems. Without efficient structures, cloud systems cannot support the necessary high throughput and provide services for millions of users. However, most existing cloud storage systems generally adopt a distributed Hash table (DHT) approach to index data, which lacks to support range-query and dynamic real-time character. It is necessary to generate a scalable, dynamical and multi-query functional index structure in cloud environment. Based on the summary and analysis of the double-layer index systems for cloud storage, this paper provides a novel concurrent skiplist based double-layer index (referred as CSD-index) for cloud data processing. Two-layer architecture, which can breakthrough single machine memory and hard drive limitation, is used to extend indexing scope. Online migration algorithm of skiplist's nodes between local servers is used to make dynamic load-balancing. The details of the design and the implement of the concurrent skiplist are discussed in this paper. Optimistic concurrency control (OCC) technique is introduced to enhance the concurrency. Through concurrent skiplist CSD-index improves the load bearing capacity of the global index and enhances the overall throughput of the index. Experimental results show the efficiency of the concurrent skiplist based double-layer index and it has viability as an alternative approach for cloud-suitable data structures. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Diangong Jishu Xuebao,"Space charge is easy to accumulate in oil-paper insulation system under high voltage DC field, which will cause the distortion of internal electric field, thus leading to the degradation of material insulation performance. Therefore, research on the influence of insulation paper aging on the space charge properties in oil-paper insulation dielectrics is of great significance. In this respect, the accelerated thermal aging experiment of insulation paper is conducted under 130 and then these papers was impregnated with new insulation oil to get the oil-paper aged for different time. Then the injection, migration and dissipation characteristics in oil-paper insulation system were studied with pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) method. The influence of insulation paper's thermal aging on the total amount of space charge under voltage on process and decay process, were investigated as well as on the surface trap energy density. The results show that the maximum positive charge density at the anode and the maximum negative charge density within the samples during voltage on process increase while the decay rates of space charges decrease with the insulation paper aging degree. The more the deterioration of the insulation paper, the larger the total amount of space charge with samples and the surface trap energy density. By investigating the influence of oil aging on space charge properties in oil-paper insulation dielectrics, it turns out the thermal agings of insulation oil and paper both will affect the distribution of space charge in oil-paper insulation dielectrics and increase the total amount of space charge, thus causing a great influence on the insulation performance of materials. © 2015, The editorial office of Transaction of China Electrotechnical Society.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"This finding described the electrochemical detection of tadalafil based on CM-β-cyclodextrin and SH-β-cyclodextrin functionalized AuatSiC nanohybrids film. The tadalafil electrochemical signal could be dramatically amplified by introducing 40% of acetonitrile in buffer medium and further enhanced by the host-guest molecular recognition capacity of β-cyclodextrin. Uniform and monodispersed ~5.0nm Au NPs were anchored on the SiC-NH2 surface via a chemical reduction process by using polyethylene glycol and sodium citrate as dispersant and stabilizing agent. CM-β-CD was covalently bound on AuatSiC by combining the amine group of SiC-NH2 with the carboxyl group of CM-β-CD with the aid of EDC/NHS coupling agent. SH-β-CD could tightly attach to the surface of AuatSiC by the strong coordinating capability between Au and thiol. Differential pulse voltammetry was successfully used to quantify tadalafil within the concentration range of 0.01-100μM under optimal conditions with a detection limit (S/N=3) of 2.5nM. In addition, the β-CD-AuatSiC nanohybrid electrochemical sensor showed high selectivity to two other erectile dysfunction drugs sildenafil and vardenafil. The proposed electrochemical sensing platform was successfully used to determine tadalafil in raw materials, herbal sexual health products, and spiked human serum samples. © 2014.",,,20143900072348,,"Yang, Long (1); Zhao, Hui (2); Li, Can-Peng (1); Fan, Shuangmei (1); Li, Bingchan (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resource, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",BBIOE4,547.1 Precious Metals - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Acetonitrile - Chemical detection - Coupling agents - Cyclodextrins - Electrochemical sensors - Gold - Molecular recognition - Nanostructured materials - Silicon carbide - Sodium compounds - Voltammetry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Can-Peng ",10.1016/j.bios.2014.08.068,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,"Number: 2014RA022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31160334, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31160334 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2012FB112 and 2014RA022 ), People's Republic of China.

Powder Technol.,"The present work attempts to investigate the influence of mechanical activation on structural and microwave absorbing properties of high titanium slag. Microwave absorbing properties of high titanium slag were investigated by using microwave cavity perturbation technique and the digital signal processing technique. The crystal structures and the molecular structure of high titanium slag before and after mechanical activation were also analyzed using XRD and Raman spectra, respectively. The results of microwave absorbing properties indicated an optimum mechanical activation duration of 12h. The results of XRD and Raman spectra showed that Ti2O3is transformed partially from Fe3Ti3O10under moderate mechanical activation, which can be better used for the production of synthetic rutile.

RSC Adv.,"This manuscript introduces a simple method to fabricate hybrid aerogels with Fe3O4nanocrystals/nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe3O4/N-GAs) through one-shot self-mineralization of ferrocenoyl phenylalanine/graphene oxide (Fc-F/GO) supramolecular hydrogels. We found that GO could trigger a sol-gel transition of Fc-F gelators below the critical gelation concentration and the electron microscopic results revealed that the self-assembled Fc-F fibrils tightly bound onto graphene sheets. Upon hydrothermal reaction, Fc moieties in these fibrils could be locally oxidized to Fe3O4nanocrystals by GO, remaining on the top of reduced GO (RGO) sheets and therefore inhibiting the self-aggregation of graphene nanosheets. After drying, the remains of the supramolecular hybrid hydrogels are presented as the three-dimensional (3D) framework of ultra-thin graphene sheets on which Fe3O4nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly immobilized as single crystals. Since the new born Fe3O4nanocrystals are closely anchored on the graphene sheets, the as-prepared Fe3O4/N-GAs complex shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, compared to commercial Pt/C). Notably, the Fc-F/GO supramolecular hydrogels act as multifunctional reagents, such as capping agents for preventing graphene nanosheets from stacking and Fe and N sources for Fe3O4/N-GAs. We expect that this intriguing strategy can provide a useful archetypical example in designing nonprecious metal oxides/carbon hybrid materials to serve as substitutes for noble metal catalysts. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20153801286450,,"He, Ting (1); Li, Zhengyuan (1); Sun, Zhifang (1); Chen, Shuzhen (1); Shen, Rujuan (2); Yi, Lunzhao (3); Deng, Liu (1); Yang, Minghui (1); Liu, Hongtao (1); Zhang, Yi (1) ","(1) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Power Metallurgy, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (3) Yunnan Food Safety Research Institute, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",RSCACL,547.1 Precious Metals - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Aerogels - Amino acids - Catalysts - Electrolytic reduction - Fabrication - Gelation - Hybrid materials - Hydrogels - Iron oxides - Magnetite - Nanocrystals - Nanosheets - Precious metals - Single crystals - Sol-gels - Supramolecular chemistry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Deng, Liu(dengliu@csu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c5ra15595a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,94,"September 4, 2015",English,Graphene,,65.0,77296-77302,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,From supramolecular hydrogels to functional aerogels: A facile strategy to fabricate Fe3O4/N-doped graphene composites,,Electrocatalytic activity - Gelation concentrations - Hydrothermal reaction - Multifunctional reagents - Noble metal catalysts - Oxygen reduction reaction - Supramolecular hydrogels - Threedimensional (3-d),5,

Earth Sci. Front.,"The theory and method for 1:50000 geological mapping in accretionary complex belt is a focus problem for present regional geological surveys. Based on 1:50000 geological mapping, the characteristics of lithologies, collage style and structural framework for accretionary complex can be easily found, which then contributes to the knowledge of tectonic evolution in suture zone. After 1:50000 geological mapping and 1:10000 structure-lithology mapping in Qomo Ri Indosinian accretionary complex in Central Qiangtang, it is discovered that this complex is comprised of intensive-cleavaged matrix and tectonic blocks that weld each other by brittle, brittle-ductile and ductile shear faults forming at the oceanic subduction stage. The matrix are composed of fine plastic rocks from submarine fans, continental slope turbidite and deep ocean deposit, and also other strongly foliated rocks. Tectonic blocks mainly contain OIB-type ophiolite relics, mafic dike relics, seamount carbonate rock relics, exotic block relics etc. This complex is characterized by a stable regional foliation S2of CCC-type, forming under a compressional background following oceanic subduction. It is also superimposed by postorogenic shallow level deformations showed by nonpenetrative foliation S3. The geological maps are expressed by means of a method named “three-component” and “four-factor”. The above practice presents methods including outcrop observation, mapping unit classification, and graphic expression of map for 1:50000 geological mapping in accretionary complex, which also provides implications for the present geological mappings in orogenic belt. ©, 2015, The Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"In this paper, we discuss the maximization of the spread of competitive influence when multiple companies market competing product using social network. We first extend the linear threshold model by incorporating the competitive influence spread, obtaining the extended linear threshold model (ELTM). We then give the objective function of selecting the optimal seed set of competing products in a social network, and the objective function is monotone and submodular under the ELTM, thus a greedy algorithm could achieve 1−1/e approximation ration (where e is the base of natural logarithm).

Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao,"A larger number of SEM images were obtained after scanning the soft soil from Zijingang in Hangzhou in order to investigate the microstructure of the soil. A three-dimensional model was established based on the characteristics of the SEM images of soft soil. Image-Pro Plus(IPP) was used to calculate the three-dimensional porosity of the soft soil. The influences of the step size, the magnification, the threshold size and the size of analyzed area on the calculated results were studied. The smaller step size was found to corresponding to a higher accuracy, and the step size 2satisfied both the computing capacity and accuracy requirements. It was suitable to choose a magnification of 1200±300 times to calculate the three-dimensional porosity. The threshold value was related to the magnification. The greater magnification should be matched with larger threshold value accordingly. Area of analysis over 70% of the total area of the image reflected effectively the entire information of the image. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

Eur. Phys. J. B,"The transport properties of an inertial Brownian motor were numerically studied in the presence of recycled noise, which is obtained by re-injecting a fraction of the primary white noise after a processing time, being introduced into the system in a multiplicative way. The simulation results indicate that various parameters such as the external driving force, the friction coefficient, the mass of the particle, the recycling strength, and the delay time can induce the current reversal phenomenon when the sign of the recycling strength is in agreement with the sign of the external bias force, otherwise the current reversal cannot be observed. Additionally, the asymptotic mean velocity as a function of the delay time of the recycled noise always shows a resonance-like behavior with the presence of a maximum current. These results demonstrate that the delay time and the recycling strength of the recycled noise can be used as the feasible and flexible control parameters for the amplitude and direction of the current. © 2015, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20151200650086,,"Jia, Zheng-Lin (1); Li, Kai-Yi (1); Li, Chun (2); Yang, Chun-Yan (1); Mei, Dong-Cheng (3) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi; 653100, China (2) Department of Computer Science, Puer University, Puer; 665000, China (3) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,452.3 Industrial Wastes,,,,,Friction - Statistical Physics - White noise,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jia, Zheng-Lin(charlie@yxnu.net) ",10.1140/epjb/e2015-60032-7,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14346036,,,,14346028,3,2015,English,Recycling,,49.0,1-6,,2015,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,European Physical Journal B,,Current control in inertial Brownian motors by noise recycling,,Brownian motors - Current reversals - External driving - Flexible control - Friction coefficients - Mean velocities - Processing time - Statistical and Nonlinear Physics,88,
RSC Adv.,"Uniform, hollow NiO microspheres constituted from nanosheets were synthesized by a simple water bath method through a SiO2spheres template-assisted approach and applied in an efficient gas sensor towards volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors. The structural characterizations reveal that sub-micrometer NiO hollow microspheres (350-400 nm) were formed by assembling NiO nanosheets of 20-40 nm thickness. The gas responses to the five reductive gases, including isopropanol, acetone, methanol, ethanol and formaldehyde, at a low concentration of 50 ppm are 11.3, 9.9, 8.2, 7.7 and 5.0, respectively. NiO hollow microspheres showed higher responses for VOCs compared to other NiO nanostructures previously reported in the literature. The gas sensor based on NiO hollow microspheres shows a high response and fast response and recovery towards VOCs, making it a promising candidate for a practical detector of VOCs. The improved performance of NiO hollow microspheres was attributed to hollow spaces that offer a high surface-to-volume ratio and an intrinsically large specific surface area of 167.31 m2g-1, leading to an improved surface activity. It was suggested that a layer of adsorbed oxygen over the NiO surface possibly decreases the thickness of the space charge layer in VOC gases and leads to an increase in resistance and therefore response. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20153901314828,,"Li, Qing (1); Chen, Nan (1); Xing, Xinxin (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 2); Wang, Yude (1, 2); Djerdj, Igor (3) ","(1) School of Physics Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Ruder BoŠkovi Institute, Bijenika 54, Zagreb; 10000, Croatia ",RSCACL,761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments,,,,,Acetone - Chemical sensors - Gas detectors - Gases - Microspheres - Nanosheets - Silica - Thickness measurement - Volatile organic compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c5ra15392a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,98,"September 4, 2015",English,Nickel oxide,,40.0,80786-80792,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,NiO nanosheets assembled into hollow microspheres for highly sensitive and fast-responding VOC sensors,,High surface-to-volume ratio - Hollow microsphere - Large specific surface areas - NiO nanostructures - Space charge layers - Structural characterization - Surface activities - Volatile organic compound (VOC),5,

Many methods, such as ISOMAP, LLE, Laplacian Eigenmap, have been proposed under manifold learning for dimensionality reduction. However, all these ideas have not taken the influence of different class into consideration, which limit the effectiveness of manifold learning. To take account for the influence for multiclass and improve the performance of dimensional reduction, we propose a new method, supervised Hessian LLE(SHLLE).

Int. J. Web Eng. Technol.,"Nowadays the information explosion have generated a large amount of data. To utilise these data, there is a trend of setup efficient data index, especially for multidimensional data indexing. However, most of the current cloud storage systems build data indexing based on the distributed hash (DHT), where data are stored by the key-value. This module is not very suitable for range queries in multidimensional data indexing. To solve these problems, this paper builds a multidimensional data index based on skip lists and octree structure. Firstly, this architecture adopts the structure of octree to store data and establish the corresponding index mechanism, it can make use of the idea of different dimensional space partitioning to achieve a multi-dimensional index. Secondly, the relevant algorithms are designed to sustain the characteristics of this framework in this paper. Finally, the simulation experiment shows that the skip-octree architecture is feasible and efficient.

IEEE Trans Power Delivery,"Power transformers have important roles as voltage converters in substations, which directly affect the safe operation of power grids. Online monitoring of winding deformation, which is one of the most common transformer faults, is crucial in protecting transformers from damage, particularly those induced by short-circuit current failures, and ensuring their safe operation. This study proposes an improved online monitoring method for winding deformations based on the Lissajous graphical analysis of voltage and current. A practical measurement system is also presented and discussed in this paper. A load normalization method is proposed to solve the problem of Lissajous diagrams changing as load varies. Finally, transformer and winding experiments are performed to verify the validity of the proposed load normalization method and the feasibility of the proposed monitoring method in distinguishing winding deformations with different degrees and locations. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20153101087809,7086082.0,"Yao, Chenguo (1); Zhao, Zhongyong (1); Mi, Yan (1); Li, Chengxiang (1); Liao, Yifan (2); Qian, Guochao (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment and System Security and New Technology, School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China (2) Electric Power Research Institute, CSG, Guangzhou; 510062, China (3) Electric Power Research Institute, Yunnan Electric Power Test Research Institute (Group) Ltd., Kunming; 650217, China ",ITPDE5,691.2 Materials Handling Methods - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 704.1 Electric Components - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment,,,,,Deformation - Electric power transmission networks - Monitoring - Partial discharges - Transformer windings - Winding,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2418344,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,08858977,4,"August 1, 2015",English,Power transformers,,24.0,1965-1973,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,,Improved Online Monitoring Method for Transformer Winding Deformations Based on the Lissajous Graphical Analysis of Voltage and Current,,Graphical analysis - Measurement system - Monitoring methods - Normalization methods - On-line monitoring methods - Transformer faults - Transformer winding deformations - Winding deformations,30,
Forests,"Reconciling conservation and livelihoods is a concern wherever forests are important in local people's lives. We plead for engaging these people in survey activities to clarify what is important to them, as a first step in conservation planning. This will help to address their priorities and gain their guidance and support for interventions. This paper presents the results of such a survey with the community of Kwerba in Mamberamo, a remote and little known part of Indonesian Papua. Views and priorities were explored through interviews, scoring exercises, community mapping and a field survey. Whereas small gardens provided most staple food, culture and livelihoods were linked to the forest. People scored primary forest highest for nearly all use categories. Primary forest was particularly highly valued as a source of construction materials, ornaments and rituals, and as a hunting place. We developed a list of the overall most important plants and animals. Many natural resources were used, but few were commercially exploited. The community had rules to control access to certain areas and resources. Taboos to restrict access to sacred places were also maintained. Our evaluation identified opportunities to achieve conservation outcomes jointly with the Kwerba people. In follow-up activities, the community presented local government with a land-use plan for their territory. The government recognized the value of our approach and requested training to implement it more widely in the region. © 2015 by the authors.",,Open Access,20154601540287,,"van Heist, Miriam (1); Liswanti, Nining (2); Boissière, Manuel (2, 3); Padmanaba, Michael (2, 4); Basuki, Imam (2, 5); Sheil, Douglas (1, 2) ","(1) Department of Ecology and Natural Resource Management (NMBU-INA), Norwegian University of Life Sciences, P.O.

Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue,"A set of PM2.5samples from three sampling sites belonging to the regional air monitoring networks of Kunming were collected during April 2013 to January 2014, and 16selected PAHs were analyzed by GC-MS. Average concentrations of PM2.5-bound PAHs from the industrial area (Jinding Mountain), traffic area (Dongfeng Tung Road) and clean area (Xishan Forest Park) were 40.67, 22.64, 22.07 ng/m3. High atmospheric pressure and the input of air mass originated from the Qujing area were the cause of rising PAHs concentration in Kunming. Result of health risk assessment of PAHs showed, the concentration of BaPeq at Jinding Mountain, Dongfeng Tung Road and Xishan Forest Park was 6.28, 4.00, 2.94 ng/m3, respectively, exceeded the national ambient air quality standard (2.5 ng/m3) in China.

Gaodianya Jishu,"In order to achieve Hilbert fractal antenna with best performance for partial discharge (PD) ultra-high-frequency (UHF) detection, we proposed to apply the genetic algorithms in the optimization and design of PD UHF Hilbert fractal antenna. By analyzing structure configuration parameters that influence antenna's performance, we designed the encoding and decoding method suitable for genetic algorithms and its fitness function. Then we established the optimization engineering for Hilbert fractal antenna and obtained a group of optimal performance parameters of Hilbert fractal antenna. On the basis of the optimized results, we fabricated prototype antenna. Actual PD experiments were carried out to detect PD signals using existing fractal antenna and optimized forth-order Hilbert fractal antenna respectively. The measurement results show that the voltage standing-wave ratio of antenna in the frequency of 300 MHz~1 GHz is less than 2. When the frequency is less than 1 GHz, the detection bandwidth can reach 700 MHz, which meets the basic performance requirements of broadband UHF antenna. Compared with traditional antenna, the optimized Hilbert fractal antenna has higher detection sensitivity and wider bandwidth. Thus, the optimized antenna can be effectively applied to PD UHF filed detection and can obtain more comprehensive PD information. © 2015, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPI.

Int. J. Heat Mass Transf.,"Abstract Fountains injected into stratified fluids are widely found in environmental and industrial settings. The onset of asymmetry and entrainment that occurs in transitional fountains is the key to understanding turbulence generation and entrainment mechanisms in fountains. In addition to the Reynolds number (Re) and the Froude number (Fr), the stratification of the ambient fluid, represented by the dimensionless temperature stratification parameter (s), also has a significant effect on the onset of asymmetry, unsteadiness, and entrainment in a fountain, and on the maximum height that the fountain penetrates in the ambient fluid. In this study, a series of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) were carried out using ANSYS Fluent for transitional plane fountains in linearly-stratified fluids with Re and s in the ranges of 25 ≤ Re ≤ 300 and 0 ≤ s ≤ 0.5, all at Fr=10. The transient behavior of the fountains, in particular the effects of Re and s on the asymmetric transition and the maximum fountain penetration heights, is analysed and quantified using the DNS results. It is found that fountains are generally symmetric in the early developing stage, but become asymmetric and unsteady subsequently. The stratification of the ambient fluid is shown to stabilize the fountain flow and to reduce its asymmetry and unsteadiness. However, the effect of s on the asymmetric behavior of a fountain is found to be weaker than that of Re. Empirical correlations were developed, using the numerical results, to quantify such effects on the time for the asymmetric transition. The effects of Re and s on the initial and time-averaged maximum fountain heights (zm,iand zm,a, respectively), and the time to attain zm,iare also analysed. Quantified correlations are developed using the DNS results, which demonstrate that both zm,iand zm,aincrease with Re, but decrease with s, apparently due to the increasing negative buoyancy that the fountain must overcome to penetrate the ambient fluid. The results further show that the effect of s on zm,iand zm,ais much stronger than that of Re. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20153201108112,12277.0,"Inam, Mohammad Ilias (1); Lin, Wenxian (1, 2); Armfield, S.W.

Asia Pac J Oper Res,"In this paper, we study a MAP/PH/1 queue with two classes of customers and discretionary priority. There are two stages of service for the low-priority customer. The server adopts the preemptive priority discipline at the first stage and adopts the nonpreemptive priority discipline at the second stage. Such a queuing system can be modeled into a quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process. But there is no general solution for this QBD process since the generator matrix has a block structure with an infinite number of blocks and each block has infinite dimensions. We present an approach to derive the bound for the high-priority queue length. It guarantees that the probabilities of ignored states are within a given error bound, so that the system can be modeled into a QBD process where the block elements of the generator matrix have finite dimensions. The sojourn time distributions of both high and low priority customers are obtained. Some managerial insights are given after comparing the discretionary priority rule with the preemptive and nonpreemptive disciplines numerically. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Co.",,,20153601246136,1550042.0,"Zhao, Ning (1); Lian, Zhaotong (2); Wu, Kan (3) ","(1) Faculty of Science, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan, China (2) Faculty of Business Administration, University of Macau, China (3) School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore ",APJRE3,922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Queueing networks - Sales,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Kan(WuKan@ntu.edu.sg) ",10.1142/S0217595915500426,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: MYRG2014-00036-FBA, Acronym: UM, Sponsor: Universidade de Macau; Number: MYRG163-FBA11-LZT, Acronym: UM, Sponsor: Universidade de Macau; Number: 14118496, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; ",This work was funded in part by Kunming University of Science and Technology under 14118496 and University of Macau under MYRG163-FBA11-LZT and MYRG2014-00036-FBA.,,02175959,6,"December 1, 2015",English,Queueing theory,,22.0,,,2015,World Scientific Publishing Co.

J. Surfactants Deterg.,"Surfactant-enhanced remediation (SER) is one of the most effective remediation methods for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) contaminated soils. However, mass deployment of SER has been restricted due to the shortage of the separation, recycle technology of the surfactant and its operation costs. This research mainly studied the reversibility of 2-n-lauryl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl guanidine (DTMG) surfactant and its influence on reversible solubilization of typical PAH. Experimental results showed that the reversibility of the DTMG surfactant is excellent. The critical micellar concentration (CMC), surface tension and pH of DTMG in CO2/N2conditions undergo reversible changes promptly. DTMG·CO2shows a strong solubilization capacity for PAH; the apparent solubilities of the selected PAH pyrene, phenanthrene and anthracene in 4 mmol/L of DTMG·CO2solution were about 32.4, 17.1 and 14.6 times higher than in water, respectively. The corresponding molar solubilization ratios were 5.4 × 10-3, 2.80 × 10-2and 1.1 × 10-3, much higher than those with DTMG. More than 50 % of the PAH in surfactant solutions could be released through gas control at each surfactant concentration, and improved release efficiency was achieved at low surfactant concentrations. In brief, such results in this work introduce a facile method to meliorate the SER technology. © 2014 AOCS.",,,20160801969205,,"Tian, Senlin (1); Long, Jian (1); He, Shanshan (1) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",JSDEFL,454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Anthracene - Aromatization - Carbon dioxide - Hydrocarbons - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - Remediation - Soil pollution - Solubility,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tian, Senlin(tiansenlin@outlook.com) ",10.1007/s11743-014-1611-4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15589293,,,,10973958,1,"January 1, 2015",English,Surface active agents,,40.0,1-7,,2015,Springer Verlag,Journal of Surfactants and Detergents,,Reversible Solubilization of Typical Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) by a Gas Switchable Surfactant,,Critical micellar concentrations - DTMG - Molar solubilization ratios - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) - Reversible solubilization - Surfactant concentrations - Surfactant-enhanced remediation - Switchable,18,
J. Mater. Chem. C,"Photon avalanche (PA) is a seldom discovered phenomenon in upconversion (UC) materials on account of the requirement for high pumping intensities and strict construction conditions. Herein, we present the controllable PA emission behavior of violet, green, red and near infrared emission from the Er3+ion in Er3+-Yb3+co-doped BiOCl crystals. We show that the generation of 'looping' and the cycle numbers of PA processes could be precisely controlled through the control of doped Yb3+concentrations. Fluorescent probe effects from doping Eu3+ions indicates that the manipulation of PA behaviors may arise from a strong dependence on the magnitude of the internal polarizable chemical environment of BiOCl crystals that are weakened on doping with Yb3+ions rather than other rare-earth dopants. Our results may offer a new insight into the mechanism for constructing PA process and promote the potential applications of PA UC phosphors in solid state lasers and optical switches. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20153301175674,,"Li, Yongjin (1, 2); Song, Zhiguo (1); Wan, Ronghua (1); Liu, Qun (1); Zhou, Yuting (1); Qiu, Jianbei (1); Yang, Zhengwen (1); Yin, Zhaoyi (1) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Department of Science Research, Yunnan Technology and Business University, Kunming; 651700, China ",JMCCCX,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 744.4 Solid State Lasers - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Chlorine compounds - Doping (additives) - Infrared devices - Ions - Optical switches - Photons - Process control - Rare earths - Solid state lasers - Uranium compounds - Ytterbium compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Zhiguo(songzg@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c5tc00224a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20507526,,,,20507534,33,"July 14, 2015",English,Bismuth compounds,,35.0,8559-8565,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,Journal of Materials Chemistry C,,Multi-band photon avalanche controlling performance of BiOCl:Er3+crystals through facile Yb3+doping,,Chemical environment - Emission behavior - Fluorescent probes - Near-infrared emissions - Photon avalanche - Pumping intensity - Rare earth dopants - Strong dependences,3,
Inf Sci,"RGB-D sensor-based scene classification has recently received attention because of its potential use in human-computer interaction applications. However, when feature representation schemes are adopted, the dimensionality of concatenated scene features extracted from the RGB and depth image pair is very high and faces the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we present a new subspace selection scheme called local structure preserving discriminative projections (LSPDP). LSPDP simultaneously considers two issues: (1) achieving a balance between the local patch structure and global within-class structure and (2) maximizing between-class distances. Extensive experimentation on the NYU Depth V1 dataset with feature sets computed using three popular schemes (locality-constrained linear coding (LLC), spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding (Sc-SPM), and efficient match kernels (EMKs)) demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the new method for RGB-D sensor-based scene classification. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Food Chem.,"A rapid, simple, sensitive and environmentally friendly method has been developed for the determination of three oestrogens (17β-estradiol (17β-E2), estrone (E1), and diethylstilbestrol (DES)) in milk samples by using vortex-assisted hollow fibre liquid-phase microextraction (VA-HF-LPME) and high performance liquid chromatography. Method is based on the microextraction of oestrogens from sample solution into 15 μL of nonanoic acid as extracting agent, which is placed inside the hollow fibre followed by vortex-mixing. Vortex provided effective and mild mixing of sample solution and increased the contact between analytes and boundary layers of the hollow fibre, thereby enhancing mass transfer rate and leading to high recovery of target analytes. The extraction equilibrium is achieved within 2 min. Parameters influencing the recovery were investigated and optimized. The proposed technique provided good linearity (>0.9984), repeatability (RSD = 2.56-4.38), low limits of detection (0.06-0.17 ng mL-1), and high enrichment factor (330). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Tectonophysics,"This study integrates 3D models of rock fractures from different sources and hydraulic properties aimed at identifying relationships between fractures and permeability. The Tono area in central Japan, chiefly overlain by Cretaceous granite, was examined because of the availability of a unique dataset from deep borehole data at 26 sites. A geostatistical method (GEOFRAC) that can incorporate orientations of sampled data was applied to 50,900 borehole fractures for spatial modeling of fractures over a 12. km by 8. km area, to a depth of 1.5. km. GEOFRAC produced a plausible 3D fracture model, in that the orientations of simulated fractures correspond to those of the sample data and the continuous fractures appeared near a known fault. Small-scale fracture distributions with dominant orientations were also characterized around the two shafts using fracture data from the shaft walls. By integrating the 3D model of hydraulic conductivity using sequential Gaussian simulation with the GEOFRAC fractures from the borehole data, the fracture sizes and directions that strongly affect permeable features were identified. Four fracture-related elements: lineaments from a shaded 10-m DEM, GEOFRAC fractures using the borehole and shaft data, and microcracks from SEM images, were used for correlating fracture attributes at different scales. The consistency of the semivariogram models of distribution densities was identified. Using an experimental relationship between hydraulic conductivity and fracture length, the fractures that typically affect the hydraulic properties at the drift scale were surmised to be in the range 100-200. m. These results are useful for a comprehensive understanding of rock fracture systems and their hydraulic characteristics at multiple scales in a target area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20152801022542,,"Koike, Katsuaki (1); Kubo, Taiki (1); Liu, Chunxue (2); Masoud, Alaa (3); Amano, Kenji (4); Kurihara, Arata (5); Matsuoka, Toshiyuki (6); Lanyon, Bill (7) ","(1) Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Katsura, Kyoto; 615-8540, Japan (2) School of Urban and Environment, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming, China (3) Geology Department, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, Tanta; 31527, Egypt (4) Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Horonobe, Hokkaido; 098-3224, Japan (5) Dia Consultant, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan (6) Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Mizunami, Gifu; 509-6132, Japan (7) Fracture Systems Ltd., United Kingdom ",,481.1 Geology - 632.1 Hydraulics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Granite - Hydraulic conductivity - Microcracking - Microcracks - Structural geology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Koike, Katsuaki(koike.katsuaki.5x@kyoto-u.ac.jp) ",10.1016/j.tecto.2015.06.008,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 20360408, Acronym: JSPS, Sponsor: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Number: 23360402, Acronym: JSPS, Sponsor: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Nihon University; Number: -, Acronym: JAEA, Sponsor: Japan Atomic Energy Agency; Number: 40902058, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors wish to express their gratitude to Takanori Akune and Takuro Hamada, who assisted in the permeability measurements and data analysis, and to Tadahiko Tsuruta of JAEA and Shinji Takeuchi of Nihon University for devoted cooperation.

Jisuanji Fuzhu Sheji Yu Tuxingxue Xuebao,"The problems for non-photorealistic rendering with current sketch rendering methods are the coincident rendering degree and lack of hierarchical physical appearance of paintings. The paper presents an automatic method for simulating sketch paintings via significance map technology. Firstly, a significance map is built up in a weighted gradient and saliency of input image, yet guides sketch artistic rendering. Secondly, anisotropic filter technique is used to smooth tensor field, and integral convolution method is adopted to generate sketch paintings along the local curve direction of this tensor field. Finally, to highlight artistic appeal of sketch under different lighting condition, the painting is rendered by the improved Phong illumination model, which can enhance hierarchical physical appearance of sketch artistic works. Experimental results show that the proposed method can be used efficiently to produce special paintings with hierarchical appearance, and this method can carry out different level of sketch to the local region while preserves feature of the local details. ©, 2015, Institute of Computing Technology.

Remote Sens.,"Long-term global satellite and reanalysis soil moisture products have been available for several years. In this study, in situ soil moisture measurements from 2008 to 2012 over Southwest China are used to evaluate the accuracy of four satellite-based products and one reanalysis soil moisture product. These products are the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E), the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative soil moisture (CCI SM), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim). The evaluation of soil moisture absolute values and anomalies shows that all the products can capture the temporal dynamics of in situ soil moisture well. For AMSR-E and SMOS, larger errors occur, which are likely due to the severe effects of radio frequency interference (RFI) over the test region. In general, the ERA-Interim (R = 0.782, ubRMSD = 0.035 m3/m3) and CCI SM (R = 0.723, ubRMSD = 0.046 m3/m3) perform the best compared to the other products. The accuracy levels obtained are comparable to validation results from other regions. Therefore, local hydrological applications and water resource management will benefit from the long-term ERA-Interim and CCI SM soil moisture products. © 2015 by the authors.",,Open Access,20155101708297,,"Peng, Jian (1); Niesel, Jonathan (1); Loew, Alexander (1, 2); Zhang, Shiqiang (3); Wang, Jie (4) ","(1) Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg; 20146, Germany (2) Department of Geography, University of Munich (LMU), Munich; 80333, Germany (3) College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an; 710027, China (4) Yunnan Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, Kunming; 650228, China ",,443 Meteorology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 655.2 Satellites - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment,,,,,Climate change - Earth (planet) - Meteorological instruments - Radio interference - Satellites - Soil surveys - Water management - Weather forecasting,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Peng, Jian(jian.peng@mpimet.mpg.de) ",10.3390/rs71115729,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20724292,,,,,11,2015,English,Soil moisture,,65.0,15729-15747,,2015,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Remote Sensing,,Evaluation of satellite and reanalysis soil moisture products over southwest China using ground-based measurements,,Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System - European centre for medium-range weather forecasts - Radio frequency interference - Reanalysis - Situ soil moistures - Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) - Southwest China - Validation,7,
J. Fiber Bioeng. Informatics,"In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method to simultaneous segmentation and labeling of parts in 3D garments. The key idea in this work is to analyze 3D garments using semi-supervised learning method which can label parts in various 3D garments. We first develop an objective function based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to learn the prior knowledge of garment components from a set of training examples. Then, we exploit an effective training method that utilizes JointBoost classifiers based on the co-analysis for garments. And we modify the JointBoost to automatically cluster the segmented components without requiring manual parameter tuning. The purpose of our method is to relieve the manual segmentation and labeling of components in 3D garment collections.

However, current methods are typically performed in 2D environments that produce immature CMs. Here we report a simple, growth factor-free 3D culture system to rapidly and efficiently generate 85.07±1.8% of spontaneously contractile cardiac spheres (scCDSs) using 3D-cultured human and monkey PSC-spheres. Along with small molecule-based 3D induction, this protocol produces CDSs of up to 95.7% CMs at a yield of up to 237 CMs for every input pluripotent cell, is effective for human and monkey PSCs, and maintains 81.03±12.43% of CDSs in spontaneous contractibility for over three months. These CDSs displayed CM ultrastructure, calcium transient, appropriate pharmacological responses and CM gene expression profiles specific for maturity. Furthermore, 3D-derived CMs displayed more mature phenotypes than those from a parallel 2D-culture.

Tectonophysics,"It is generally believed that the extrusion of SE Tibet was bounded by the dextral Gaoligong and the sinistral Ailaoshan-Red River strike-slip shear zones from the Oligocene to early Miocene. This study integrates field mapping, structural analysis and geochronology in western Yunnan (China), where foliated Precambrian basement rocks and late Cretaceous to early Eocene plutons are exposed to the west of the Gaoligong shear zone. We found that late Eocene to early Miocene flat-lying ductile shear zones were kinematically related to steeply dipping strike-slip shear zones. Four elongated gneiss domes (Donghe, Guyong, Yingjiang and Sudian) are cored by high-grade metamorphic rocks and pre-kinematic granite plutons, and bounded by top-to-NE detachments and NE-trending dextral strike-slip shear zones. Zircon U-Pb ages from LA-ICP-MS analysis and40Ar/39Ar ages of micas and hornblende demonstrate that the flat-lying Donghe Detachment (>35-15Ma) and the Nabang dextral strike-slip shear zone (41-19Ma) were sites of prolonged, mostly coeval ductile deformation from amphibolite to greenschist facies metamorphism. The Gaoligong shear zone experienced dextral shearing under similar metamorphic conditions between 32 and 10Ma. Consistent40Ar/39Ar ages of hornblende from the three shear zones indicate their contemporaneity at mid-crustal depth, causing the rapid exhumation and SW-ward extrusion of the Tengchong Terrane. The strain geometry and shear zone kinematics in the Tengchong Terrane are interpreted with folding of the anisotropic lithosphere around a vertical axis, i.e., the northeast corner of the Indian Plate since 41Ma. The newly discovered NE-trending Sudian, Yingjiang, and Lianghe strike-slip shear zones are subordinate ductile faults accommodating the initially rapid clockwise rotation of the Tengchong Terrane. The detachments caused mid-crustal decoupling and faster SW-ward extrusion below the sedimentary cover, whereas the strike-slip shear zones accommodated extrusion and clockwise rotation of the Tengchong Terrane around the proto-Eastern Himalayan syntaxis since the late Eocene. © 2015 The Authors.",,Open Access,20155201731826,,"Xu, Zhiqin (1, 2); Wang, Qin (1, 2); Cai, Zhihui (1); Dong, Hanwen (1); Li, Huaqi (1); Chen, Xijie (1); Duan, Xiangdong (3); Cao, Hui (1); Li, Jing (3); Burg, Jean-Pierre (4) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Continental Tectonics and Dynamics, Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing; 100037, China (2) State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, Department of Earth Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing; 210046, China (3) Geological Survey of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650051, China (4) Geologisches Institut, ETH Zurich, Zurich; 8092, Switzerland ",,408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 481.1 Geology - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 484.1 Earthquake Measurements and Analysis - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 931.1 Mechanics - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments,,,,,Clocks - Domes - Extrusion - Geochronology - Kinematics - Lead alloys - Metamorphic rocks - Mica - Silicate minerals - Structural geology - Zircon,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Zhiqin(3077864156@qq.com) ",10.1016/j.tecto.2015.09.033,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 1212010818094, Acronym: CGS, Sponsor: China Geological Survey; Number: 40921001, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Profs.

Energy,"The effects of DMF (2,5-dimethylfuran) fuel properties combined with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation), CA50, EHN (2-Ethylhexyl nitrate) and multi-injection strategies on combustion and emission characteristics were experimentally investigated in two common-rail diesel engines including a single-cylinder engine and a multi-cylinder engine. Results demonstrate that, with DMF addition into diesel, ID (ignition delay) prolongs and smoke decreases more greatly as EGR rate increases. When DMF addition fraction increases up to 40%, the inherent trade-off between NOxand smoke can be eliminated, but the MPRR (maximum pressure rise rate) is too high. However, the higher MPRR can be reduced efficiently without serious penalties in smoke and BTE (brake thermal efficiency) by delaying CA50 and adding EHN reasonably. Although DMF and gasoline have very similar physic-chemical properties, DMF/diesel blends are much more efficient than gasoline/diesel wide-distillation blends to reduce soot with high EGR rates due to its much longer ID and atomic oxygen. With increasing DMF addition fraction, BTE is affected less by the delay of CA50, meanwhile, multi-injection strategies have less impact on soot generation. Additionally, as compared to the delay of CA50 and the addition of EHN, the employ of pilot injection is poor to reduced MPRR for DMF/diesel blends. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20155101681984,,"Chen, Guisheng (1); Di, Lei (1); Zhang, Quanchang (2); Zheng, Zunqing (3); Zhang, Wei (1) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Internal Combustion Engine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) College of Automobile, Chang'an University, Xi'an; 710064, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Engines, Tianjin University, Tianjin; 300072, China ",ENEYDS,523 Liquid Fuels - 612.1.1 Internal Combustion Engine Components - 612.2 Diesel Engines - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Combustion - Diesel engines - Distillation - Economic and social effects - Engine cylinders - Gases - Gasoline - Smoke - Soot,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Guisheng(cgs_yly@163.com) ",10.1016/j.energy.2015.09.066,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FB019, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: KKSY201302127, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 51366007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports to the research provided by National Science Foundation of China ( 51366007 ), Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department of China ( 2013FB019 ) and Yunnan Provincial Talent Cultivation Project of China ( KKSY201302127 ).",,03605442,,"December 15, 2015",English,Exhaust gas recirculation,,40.0,284-293,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Energy,,"Effects of 2,5-dimethylfuran fuel properties coupling with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) on combustion and emission characteristics in common-rail diesel engines",,"CI engine - Combustion characteristics - DMF (2,5-dimethylfuran) - EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) - Fuel properties",93,
J. Agric. Food Chem.,"Constructing a dense cross-linking layer on a polymer film surface is a good way to improve the water resistance of poly(lactic acid) (PLA). However, conventional plasma treatments have failed to achieve the aim as a result of the unavoidable surface damage arising from the charged species caused by the uncontrolled high energy coming from colliding ions and electrons. In this work, we report a modified plasma method called hyperthermal hydrogen-induced cross-linking (HHIC) technology to construct a dense cross-linking layer on PLA film surfaces. This method produces energy-controlled neutral hyperthermal hydrogen, which selectively cleaves C-H bonds by molecule collision from the PLA film without breaking other bonds (e.g., C-C bonds in the polymer backbone), and results in subsequent cross-linking of the carbon radicals generated from the organic molecules. The formation of a dense cross-linking layer can serve as a barrier layer to significantly improve both the hydrophobicity and water vapor barrier property of the PLA film. Because of the advantage of selective cleavage of C-H bonds by HHIC treatment, the original physical properties (e.g., mechanical strength and light transmittance) of the PLA films are well-preserved. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20155101703428,,"Du, Wangli (1); Shao, Hong (2); He, Zhoukun (2); Tang, Changyu (2); Liu, Yu (2); Shen, Tao (1); Zhu, Yan (1); Lau, Woon-Ming (2); Hui, David (3) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) Chengdu Green Energy, Green Manufacturing Technology R and D Center, Chengdu Development Center of Science and Technology, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Chengdu, Sichuan; 610207, China (3) Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of New Orleans, New Orleans; LA; 70148, United States ",JAFCAU,"712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,,Building materials - Hydrogen bonds - Hydrophobicity - Lactic acid - Molecules - Polymer films - Semiconducting films - Water vapor,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Changyu(sugarchangyu@163.com) ",10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04249,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205118,,,,00218561,49,"December 16, 2015",English,Crosslinking,,32.0,10604-10610,,2015,American Chemical Society,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,,Cross-Linking Poly(lactic acid) Film Surface by Neutral Hyperthermal Hydrogen Molecule Bombardment,,Hydrogen molecule - Light transmittance - Organic molecules - Poly lactic acid - Poly lactic acid films - Polymer backbones - Water vapor barriers - Water-resistances,63,
IEEE Photon. J.,"Effect of cerium codoping on Stokes or anti-Stokes luminescence of BiOCl:Er3+ crystals, which were controlled by a special photon avalanche (PA) mechanism under 980-nm excitation, was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicate that Ce3+ ions were successfully doped into BiOCl lattices. However, in PA photoluminescence behaviors, the doped Ce3+ ions did not present efficient resonant energy transfer (ET) processes between the Er3+ ions as generally reported. As a result, the intensity of visible PA upconversion emission and 1.54 μm downshifting near-infrared (NIR) emission of Er3+ ions shows the same concentration dependence of cerium dopants. This phenomenon can be understood by the influence of cerium dopant content on the magnitude of internal electric field in layered BiOCl crystals, which may play a more important role on the upconversion (UC) and NIR luminescence of Er3+ than the traditional ET between rare-earth (RE) ions. The results of our work may offer a different understanding for the method to control the emissions of RE ions. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20153801293241,1601108.0,"Liu, Qun (1); Li, Yongjin (2); Kuang, Qingliang (1); Song, Zhiguo (1); Wan, Ronghua (1); Zhou, Yuting (1); Xu, Zuyuan (1); Hu, Rui (1); Qiu, Jianbei (1); Yang, Zhengwen (1); Yin, Zhaoyi (1) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Department of Science Research, Yunnan Technology and Business University, Kunming; 651700, China ",,531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Bismuth compounds - Cerium - Chlorine compounds - Doping (additives) - Electric fields - Energy transfer - Infrared devices - Ions - Luminescence - Metallic glass - Photons - Rare earths - Uranium compounds - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Zhiguo(songzg@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2460115,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,19430655,5,"October 1, 2015",English,X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,,27.0,,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Photonics Journal,,Unusual effect of cerium codoping on stokes and anti-stokes luminescence of BiOCl:Er3+crystal,,Co-doped - Concentration dependence - Internal electric fields - Near-infrared emissions - Photon avalanche - Resonant energy transfer - Stokes and anti-Stokes - Up-conversion emission,7,
NMR Biomed.,"Water is present in cortical bone in different binding states. In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of inversion time (TI) on the signal from bound and pore water in cortical bone using an adiabatic inversion recovery prepared ultrashort echo time (IR-UTE) sequence on a clinical 3T scanner. In total ten bovine midshaft samples and four human tibial midshaft samples were harvested for this study. Each cortical sample was imaged with the UTE and IR-UTE sequences with a TR of 300ms and a series of TI values ranging from 10 to 240ms. Five healthy volunteers were also imaged with the same sequence. Single- and bi-component models were utilized to calculate the T2* and relative fractions of short and long T2* components. Bi-component behavior of the signal from cortical bone was seen with the IR-UTE sequence, except with a TI of around 80ms, where the short T2* component alone were seen and a mono-exponential decay pattern was observed. In vivo imaging with the IR-UTE sequence provided high contrast-to-noise images with direct visualization of bound water and reduced signal from long T2muscle and fat. Our preliminary results demonstrate that selective nulling of the pore water component can be achieved with the IR-UTE sequence with an appropriate TI, allowing selective imaging of the bound water component in cortical bone in vivo using clinical MR scanners. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,20144900296373,,"Li, Shihong (1, 2); Ma, Lanqing (2, 3); Chang, Eric Y.

Secur., CIS","Cloud computing has generated a major impact on the global IT ecosystem, which promises economic advantages, speed, agility, flexibility, virtually infinite elasticity and innovation. However, data security and privacy remain the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of cloud services. To address the problem of fine-grained access control over encrypted data that is faced by cloud services, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology was proposed in recent years and has aroused great concern of researchers. Although CP-ABE schemes provide the ability for data owner-centric protection in cloud services, they are not very practical with the respect to the efficiency and scalability of access right revocation and key refreshing. Recently Xu and Martin proposed a dynamic user revocation and key refreshing model for CP-ABE schemes, and presented a concrete construction based on Bethencourt et al.'s CP-ABE scheme. They claimed that their construction is efficient and provable secure.

Micro. Nano. Lett.,"Anisotropic metal nanoparticles are of considerable interest to researchers because of their unique optical, electronic and catalytic properties compared with spherical nanoparticles. This Letter describes how chloride ions and citrate ions can be added to silver (Ag) nitrate solution to synthesise anisotropic silver nanostructures especially to form the Ag nanowires (AgNWs) without high hydrothermal or solvothermal operating temperatures. The AgCl colloidal precipitates were produced in the initial stage promoting the reduction of free silver ions and helping control silver ions at low concentration for the growth of AgNWs. The synthesis of AgNWs was also temperature and hydroxide radical dependent since the citrate ions could direct the growth of AgNWs at proper temperatures (over 130°C) in the absence of chloride ions. Transmission electron microscopy and UV-vis absorption spectra have been used to investigate the obtained products. The experimental results suggested that the chloride ions played a crucial role in directing the growth of anisotropic Ag nanostructures. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.",,,20151000604740,,"Tang, Junqi (1); Zhao, Qianrun (1); Zhang, Ning (1); Man, Shi-Qing (1) ","(1) College of Physics and Electronic Information, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,"531.1 Metallurgy - 547.1 Precious Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Anisotropy - Catalysis - Colloids - Electromagnetic wave absorption - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Metal ions - Metal nanoparticles - Nanotechnology - Nanowires - Reduction - Silver - Silver halides - Temperature - Transmission electron microscopy - Ultraviolet spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1049/mnl.2014.0185,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17500443,,,,,2,"February 1, 2015",English,Chlorine compounds,,24.0,71-75,,2015,Institution of Engineering and Technology,Micro and Nano Letters,,Citrate ions and chloride ions involved in the synthesis of anisotropic silver nanostructures,,Anisotropic metal nanoparticles - Catalytic properties - Chloride ions - Citrate ions - Operating temperature - Silver nanostructures - UV-VIS absorption spectra - Visible spectra,10,

Zidonghua Xuebao Acta Auto. Sin.,"In this paper, we present a swarm intelligent algorithm and study its convergence property. We name it as multivariant optimization algorithm (MOA) because its multiple searchers (atoms) are variant in responsibilities. The solution space is searched through global-local search iterations which are based on the collaboration and coordination between the local and global search groups in the MOA. In each iteration, the global atoms explore the whole solution space to locate potential areas and then multiple local groups with different numbers of local search atoms are allotted to these potential areas for different levels of refinements. The historical better solutions are recorded in a structure made up of a queue and some stacks, according to a certain rule. The candidate solutions in the structure are improved iteratively and will converge to the optimal solutions. A theoretical convergence analysis based on Markov process shows that MOA converges to more than one global optimal solutions with probability 1. To evaluate its convergence property, MOA and other five frequently compared algorithms are employed to locate the optimal solutions of thirteen two-dimensional and ten-dimensional benchmark functions. The results show that the MOA has competitive performance to the other algorithms in terms of the convergence success rate and accuracy. Copyright © 2015 Acta Automatica Sinica.

Silicon,"Aluminum is one of the main impurity elements in metallurgical-grade silicon (MG-Si). The methods of aluminum removal from MG-Si are slag refining, directional solidification, acid leaching and vacuum evaporation refining, respectively. Based on the theoretical calculation, the vacuum evaporation refining experiments for aluminum removal were carried out in this paper. The effects of refining time and temperature on the removal efficiency of aluminum were investigated. The results show that the vacuum evaporation is an efficient refining technique for removing impurity aluminum from MG-Si. The content of aluminum in MG-Si can be reduced from 1120 × 10−6to 427 × 10−6, and its removal efficiency is 61.9 %.

Dalton Trans.,"New platinum(II) and ruthenium(II) mononuclear complexes with naphthalene-based Schiff base ligands L1(H2-selnaph) and L2(H2-selnaph-COOH) were synthesized: Pt-selnaph (1), Pt-selnaph-COOH (2), Ru-selnaph(4-picoline)2(3), and Ru-selnaph(isoquinoline)2(4). The complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight spectrometry, and elemental analysis, and their electrochemical and photophysical properties were investigated. The luminescent complexes 1 and 2 were used as photosensitizers for visible-light driven hydrogen production reactions in the presence of sacrificial electron donor triethylamine and cocatalyst precursor K2PtCl4aqueous solution. When complex 2 was attached to the surface of TiO2by a carboxyl group, enhanced hydrogen photogeneration was achieved compared with complex 2 alone, with turnover numbers of about 84 after 12 h irradiation. Calculations based on electrochemical and spectroscopic data also confirmed the feasibility of electron injection through the carboxyl group of complex 2 into the conduction band of TiO2for hydrogen production reactions. Complexes 3 and 4 were found to be efficient stable water oxidation (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6-driven catalysts with a first-order reaction behavior.

J Electroanal Chem,"A novel approach to the synthesis of mono-dispersed platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) has been proposed. With this method, we successfully assembled mono-dispersed Pt NPs on MWNTs. The method involved the in situ high-temperature decomposition of the precursor, platinum (II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2), in liquid polyols. We used X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize the resulting MWNTs covered with Pt NPs (Pt@MWNTs). We found that the size of the Pt NPs and the coverage density on MWNTs could be tuned easily by changing the reaction temperature and the initial mass ratio of Pt(acac)2to MWNTs. Electrocatalytic measurements showed that the Pt@MWNTs had excellent catalytic activities in the electrooxidation of methanol and in the oxygen reduction reaction. These Pt@MWNTs have potential applications in fuel cells and biosensors. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Waste Manage.,"Anaerobic digestion is an effective method for treating animal by-products, generating at the same time green energy as methane (CH4). However, the methods and mechanisms involved in anaerobic digestion of α-keratin wastes like hair, nails, horns and hooves are still not clear. In this study we investigated the feasibility of anaerobically co-digesting ground beef hooves in the presence of swine manure or slaughterhouse sludge at 25°C using eight 42-L Plexiglas lab-scale digesters. Our results showed addition of beef hooves statistically significantly increased the rate of CH4production with swine manure, but only increased it slightly with slaughterhouse sludge. After 90-day digestion, 73% of beef hoof material added to the swine manure-inoculated digesters had been converted into CH4, which was significantly higher than the 45% level achieved in the slaughterhouse sludge inoculated digesters. BODIPY-Fluorescent casein staining detected proteolytic bacteria in all digesters with and without added beef hooves, and their relative abundances corresponded to the rate of methanogenesis of the digesters with the different inocula. Fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with BODIPY-Fluorescent casein staining identified most proteolytic bacteria as members of genus Alkaliphilus in the subfamily Clostridiaceae 2 of family Clostridiaceae. They thus appear to be the bacteria mainly responsible for digestion of beef hooves. © 2014.",,,20150400441057,,"Xia, Yun (1, 4); Wang, Ding-Kang (1); Kong, Yunhong (1); Ungerfeld, Emilio M.

Acta Geoscientica Sin.,"Two earthquakes of MS5.6 and MS6.1 occurred successively on May, 2014, in Yingjiang, Yunnan province. In order to determine their seismogenic structures and the regional active tectonic settings, the authors carried out field investigation of seismic intensity, remote sensing image interpretation, analysis of focal mechanism solutions and aftershock distribution. The results show that the macro-epicenters of two earthquakes were both located near the area of Malipo Village, Mengnong Township, Yingjiang County, but their seismogenic faults are different from each other. The former was associated with the NE-trending left-lateral strike-slip Xima-Panlongshan fault, whereas the latter occurred along the SN-trending right-lateral strike-slip Sudian fault. Historical seismicities were dominated by the earthquakes with magnitude 5~6 in the Yingjiang region, which clustered along the SN-trending fault. Under the combination effect of Sagaing fault and inner arc belt in western Yunnan, the north of Tengchong block bounded by Dayingjiang fault is mainly dominated by nearly SN-trending right-lateral strike slip faults, whereas the south is dominated by NE-trending left-lateral strike slip faults. The activity of nearly NS-tranding faults was relatively stronger in Late Quaternary. © 2015, Science Press.

Acta Tabacaria Sin.,"Field experiments with burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco material were set up in Dazhou tobacco growing area of Sichuan and Dali tobacco growing area of Yunnan to explore the effect of curing methods on the contents of neutral aroma substances in tobacco. Matured tobacco leaves of the same tobacco type were subjected to flue-curing and air-curing separately, and contents of neutral aroma substances were measured after curing. Results showed that contents and proportions of neutral aroma substances in cured leaves with different curing methods displayed significant difference while their components were the same. The air-curing was unfavorable for the accumulation of aroma substances and neophytadiene in flue-cured tobacco, but it could significantly increase the contents of solanone and Maillard reaction products in flue-cured tobacco. The flue-curing was unfavorable for the accumulation of solanone, linalool, geranyl, dihydroactinidiolided and famesyl aeclonr in burley tobacco, but good for the accumulation of neophytadiene, dehydrogenation, ketoisophorone, megastigmatrienone, solavetivone and aromatic amino acid degradation products. Under air-curing condition, flue-cured tobacco showed little of its due characteristics with decreased aroma quality and sweetness and enhanced irritation; under flue-curing condition, burley tobacco presented little of its burley style with improved aroma quality and sweetness and less irritation. ©, 2015, State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and China Tobacco Society.

Appl Surf Sci,"The surface fluorinated TiO2/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (denoted as F-TiO2-RGO) were synthesized via hydrothermal method. The as-prepared materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectra (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The results showed that pure anatase TiO2 particles were anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide. And the HF added during the preparation process can not only prevent phase transformation from anatase to rutile, but also the F- ion adsorbed on the surface of TiO2-RGO surface can enhance photocatalytic activity of F-TiO2-RGO. The photocatalytic activities of F-TiO2-RGO nanocomposites were evaluated by decomposing bisphenol A under UV light illumination. Under optimal degradation condition, the degradation rate constant of BPA over F-TiO2-10RGO (0.01501 min-1) was 3.41 times than that over P25 (0.00440 min-1). The result indicated that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of F-TiO2-10RGO was ascribed to the adsorbed F ion and RGO in F-TiO2-RGO composite, which can reduce the recombination rate of the photo-generated electrons and holes synergistically. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Energy Convers. Manage.,"An indoor experimental test rig of parabolic trough collector (PTC)-based natural circulation steam generation system consisting in a thermosyphon loop was presented. A series of five heat loads (0.6-1.2 kW) were applied to investigate effect of heat load on thermal performance of the system. Effect of heat load on flow pattern, thermal efficiency and two phase heat transfer coefficient was discussed, respectively. An extended correlation equation was provided for two flow patterns, which is characterized by heat pipe thermal resistance. The critical heat pipe thermal resistance for flow pattern transition was ranged from 34.37 K/kW to 33.35 K/kW. Simultaneously, thermal efficiency shows a continuous increase as heat load kept rising. The effect of backflow was found to be negligible when heat load increased to 1.1 kW. Additionally, the average two-phase heat transfer coefficient in receiver also went up with the rising of heat load for the same flow pattern. Due to the flow pattern transition, which resulted in a dryness fraction drop in receiver, a maximum heat transfer coefficient of 285.86 W/m2K was obtained at heat load of 1.0 kW under a steam discharging pressure of 0.15 MPa. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Chem. Eng. Process.: Process Intensif.,"A new solvent extraction system of extracting La(III) with 2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid-2-ethylhexyl ester (P507) has been investigated to intensify the extraction process in microreactor, and solve the problems like long mixing time, low processing capacity, large factory area occupation, and high energy consumption in the conventional rare earth solvent extraction equipment. In this work, extraction equilibrium studies show that the initial aqueous pH value 4.00 and saponification rate 40% are the optimal operation condition. The effects of volumetric flow rate on extraction efficiency are analyzed, and the results indicate that increasing flow ratio could improve the extraction efficiency greatly, up to almost 100%, and the two phases keep parallel flow while keeping an aqueous-organic interface in the microchannel. The mass transfer rate is proportional to the initial pH and P507 concentration, and approaches almost a constant value at high pH and extractant concentration, and the transfer process between the two phases accompanied with an interface chemical reaction is confirmed to proceed satisfactorily in a short time (residence time. =. 0.37. s).

J. Geochem. Explor.,"A systematic geochemical lake sediment survey has been carried out in major freshwater lakes in China. Surface lake sediment (0-20cm) at a density of 1sample/4km2and deep lake sediment (150-180cm) at a density of 1sample/16km2were collected and analyzed with standard procedures. This overview provides a current ecological risk assessment for toxic metal contamination (As, Cd, Cr, Cu. Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the surface sediments of major freshwater lakes in China. Lake sediment in China poses a moderate ecological risk on a nationwide basis using a potential ecological risk index (PERI). Mercury ranked as presenting the greatest ecological risk, followed by Cd, As, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, and Zn. Liangzi Lake was classified as having high ecological risk; Dalonghu Lake, Dianchi Lake, Dongting Lake, Fuxian Lake, and Qilu Lake as having moderate ecological risk; while the other surveyed lakes were classified as having low ecological risk. Uncertainties of risk assessment are also discussed by considering geochemical background, the eco-toxicity of metals and the sensitivities of local benthic communities.

Chin J Chem Eng,"The purification and separation of durene from the mixture containing durene isomers were studied. Since the boiling points of tetramethyl benzene isomers are very close but their melting points are of great differences, static melt crystallization was applied to separate and purify durene from its isomers. Crystallization experiments were carried out under various operating conditions. The effects of cooling rate, crystallization temperature, sweating temperature and sweating time on the yield and purity of crystal were investigated. Orthogonal experimental design method was adopted to analyze the factors that may affect the yield of durene. Under the optimal crystallization conditions, the purity of durene could reach as high as 99.06% with the yield of 75.3% through one crystallization process.

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"Previous investigations suggested that Streptomyces jiujiangensis JXJ 0074Tcan secrete antialgal compounds. In this study, an antialgal compound was isolated from the cultured broth of S. jiujiangensis JXJ 0074Tby using bioassay methods. Based on spectroscopic data, the active compound was identified as 2′-deoxyadenosine, which exhibited a greater antialgal activity against cyanobacteria than its analogues such as adenosine, guanosine, and 2′-deoxyguanosine. The antialgal activity of 2′-deoxyadenosine increased with the content and time. 2′-Deoxyadenosine severely damaged the vegetative cells of cyanobacteria, causing crumpling, collapse, expanding, perforation, breakage of filamentous cyanobacteria, and decrease of the chlorophyll. However, 2′-deoxyadenosine seemed to have less impact on the morphology of heterocysts of filamentous cyanobacteria. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the treated cells of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905 initially increased with 31.14 ± 2.00 % higher than that of the control after 36 h and then decreased quickly. On the same time, there were rapid increases in superoxide anion radical (O2−) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents with 315.53 ± 12.81 and 84.72 ± 6.15 % higher than these of the controls at 60 h, respectively. The intracellular microcystin-LR (MC-LR) content in the treated cells of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905 increased by 36.34 ± 7.35 % 1 day later, followed by a rapid decrease with a rate of 90.50 ± 1.08 % 8 days later, while the extracellular MC-LR content showed no significant difference with the control. Five days after adding 15 μg/ml of 2′-deoxyadenosine to the culture of M. aeruginosa FACHB-905, there was no 2′-deoxyadenosine detected by HPLC, suggesting that 2′-deoxyadenosine completely degraded.

Environ. Monit. Assess.,"Hainan, the largest tropical island in China, belongs to the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. The Changhua watershed is a center of endemism for plants and birds and the cradle of Hainan’s main rivers. However, this area has experienced recent and ongoing deforestation and habitat fragmentation. To quantify habitat loss and fragmentation of natural forests, as well as the land-cover changes in the Changhua watershed, we analyzed Landsat images obtained in 1988, 1995, and 2005. Land-cover dynamics analysis showed that natural forests increased in area (97,909 to 104,023 ha) from 1988 to 1995 but decreased rapidly to 76,306 ha over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily throughout the study period while pulp plantations rapidly expanded after 1995. Similar patterns of land cover change were observed in protected areas, indicating a lack of enforcement. Natural forests conversion to rubber and pulp plantations has a general negative effect on biodiversity, primarily through habitat fragmentation. The fragmentation analysis showed that natural forests area was reduced and patch number increased, while patch size and connectivity decreased. These land-cover changes threatened local biodiversity, especially island endemic species. Both natural forests losses and fragmentation should be stopped by strict enforcement to prevent further damage. Preserving the remaining natural forests and enforcing the status of protected areas should be a management priority to maximize the watershed’s biodiversity conservation value. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,,20150100393308,,"Zhai, De-Li (1, 2, 3); Cannon, Charles H.

Polym.-Plast. Technol. Eng.,"To study the effect of the content of the nematic cross-linking units on the mesophase behaviors, the optical and mesomorphic properties of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs), aseries of LCEs have been synthesized by hydrosilylation reaction with poly(methylhydrogeno)siloxane, a cholesteric liquid crystalline monomer, and a nematic cross-linking agent. The chemical structures and properties of the synthesized LCEs have been investigated by use of various techniques. Homopolymer P0bearing only cholesteric component displays a smectic A phase, but elastomers P1-P5containing different content of nematic cross-linking units show a cholesteric mesophase. The reflection wavelengths of theLCEs show a weak temperature dependence at lower temperatures but a strong temperature dependence at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the maximum reflection wavelengths of the LCEs can be stabilized over a wide temperature range when the LCEs are heated, suggesting that the helical structure and pitch of the cholesteric phase can be stabilized with a polymer network. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,20152000845465,,"Zhang, Qun-Yuan (1); Wang, Ji-Wei (1) ","(1) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Entomological Biopharmaceutical R&D, Dali University, Dali, China ",,641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 817.1 Polymer Products - 818.2 Elastomers - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Crystalline materials - Elastomers - Hydrosilylation - Liquids - Plastics - Silicones - Temperature distribution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Ji-Wei(jlwjw_cn@sina.com) ",10.1080/03602559.2014.974275,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15256111,,This work is supported by the Scientific Foundation of the Education Department of Yunnan Province and the Application Development Foundation of Dali University.,,03602559,7,"May 11, 2015",English,Crosslinking,,38.0,661-670,,2015,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Polymer - Plastics Technology and Engineering,,Study on the Optical and Mesomorphic Properties of Cholesteric Side-Chain Liquid Crystalline Elastomers Containing a Nematic Cross-Linking Agent,,Cross linking agents - Hydrosilylation reaction - Liquid crystalline elastomers - Liquid crystalline monomers - Mesophase behavior - Pitch length - Side chain liquid crystalline elastomers - Structures and properties,54,

Appl Phys A,"Large laser-induced thermoelectric voltages (LITVs) are measured in the electron-doped Nd2−xCexCuO4thin films grown on the vicinal-cut SrTiO3substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The dependence of LITV signals upon the doping carrier density is investigated by changing the Ce content of the films. The optimum Ce dopant corresponding to the largest voltage is found and is attributed to the two-dimensional transport behaviors of the localized electrons. The shorter laser irradiation always induces the larger voltage signals in samples with richer Ce content, suggesting the optimum dopant level is sensitive to the wavelength of excitation source. Thus, the behaviors of LITV signals are resulted from both effects of the anisotropic thermoelectric transport and the optical properties of the thin films. The doping dependence related with an anisotropic charge transport may come from the change in carrier density and the modification in energy band configuration. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20152400928745,,"Xiong, Fei (1, 2); Zhang, Hui (2); Yang, Sheng’an (2); Li, Dongqi (2); Zhang, Zheng (1, 2); Chen, Qingming (2) ","(1) Research Institute of Engineering and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Institute of Advanced Materials for Photo-Electronics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",APAMFC,"482.2 Minerals - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 712.1 Semiconducting Materials - 741.1 Light/Optics - 744.1 Lasers, General - 744.9 Laser Applications - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Anisotropy - Carrier concentration - Carrier transport - Cerium - Cerium compounds - Copper compounds - Laser excitation - Optical properties - Perovskite - Perovskite solar cells - Pulsed laser deposition - Pulsed lasers - Semiconductor doping - Strontium titanates,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Qingming(chqm99@yahoo.com) ",10.1007/s00339-015-9246-5,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320630,,,,09478396,2,"August 25, 2015",English,Thin films,,24.0,717-723,,2015,Springer Verlag,Applied Physics A: Materials Science and Processing,,Doping dependence of laser-induced transverse thermoelectric voltages in the perovskite Nd2−xCexCuO4thin films,,Anisotropic charge transport - Excitation sources - Laser induced thermoelectric voltages - Localized electrons - SrTiO3 substrates - Thermoelectric transport - Thermoelectric voltage - Transport behavior,120,
Mater Sci Semicond Process,"A photoactive compound extracted from a fungus (Hypocrella bambuase), named hypocrellins, was used as template to synthesize thermally stable mesoporous materials. The synthesized mesoporous titania samples were characterized using a combination of various physicochemical techniques, such as N2adsorption/desorption measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV - vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results of physicochemical characterizations showed that the as-synthesized sample was a composite of highly crystalline mesoporous anatase titania and graphitic carbon (gc-MTiO2), which implies the dual function of hypocrellins as template and 'dopant'. The in situ doped graphitic carbon significantly increased the visible-light absorbance of TiO2. The gc-MTiO2exhibited efficient photocatalytic activity under visible-light for photodegradation of acetaldehyde, a common indoor air pollutant. The photophysics and electron dynamics in this photocatalytic process were studied by time-resolved FT-IR spectra, in particular on the nano- to milli-second time scale. It is observed that electrons were injected into the conduction band of gc-MTiO2and they were decayed to deep traps caused by graphitic carbon. The reported strategies could open up new uses for mesoporous titania self-doped with carbon in applications such as solar cells, photocatalysts, photoelectrical devices, and photo-induced sensors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Proc. - Int. Conf. Inf. Technol. Med. Educ., ITME","To explore the statistical properties of experimental SNP data, a large number of experimental DNA samples from five populations (Africa, America, Europe, East Asia and South Asia) were subjected to statistical analysis in this paper. We classified the SNPs into different types based on the frequency of their minor alleles in the sample. The results show that the relationship between the number of different types of SNPs and the frequency of their minor alleles in the sample are very similar to the theoretical inferences and can be expressed by a power function. All of the populations carry excesses of very rare SNPs compared with the expectation, which reflects recent explosive increases in population size. Compare with other populations, the excessive very rare SNPs of America extends to a higher frequency, which reflects a relatively earlier start time of the recent explosive increases in population size. This finding is probably due to the region being far away from the battlefields of the First World War and Second World War. That the non-Africa populations carry excesses of high-frequency SNPs is an obvious sign of the founder effect, which indicates that the results are consistent with the Out of Africa hypothesis. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161902355490,7429139.0,"Sun, Jian-Hong (1); Xu, Hai-Cheng (1); Qiming, Lou (1) ","(1) Engineering College of Honghe University, Yunnan Mengzi, China ",,404.1 Military Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,119943.0,"November 13, 2015 - November 15, 2015","Huangshan, Anhui, China","7th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education, ITME 2015",Explosives - Forestry - Genes - Military operations - Regression analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ITME.2015.43,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467383028.0,,,"March 8, 2016",English,Population statistics,"Proceedings - 2015 7th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education, ITME 2015",21.0,247-251,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2015 7th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education, ITME 2015",ChuZhou University (CHZU); et al.; Future University Hakodate (FUN); Iwate Prefectural University; The University of Hull; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),Statistical analysis on the experimental SNP data based on neutral theory,,Effective population size - High frequency HF - Higher frequencies - Neutral theories - Population sizes - Power functions - Second World War - Statistical properties,,
J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol.,"Nitrates and eutectic nitrate mixtures are considered as potential phase change materials (PCMs) for the middle-temperature-range solar energy storage applications. But the extensive utilization is restricted by the poor thermal conductivity and thermal stability. In the present study, sodium nitrate-potassium nitrate eutectic mixture was used as the base PCM, and expanded graphite (EG) was added to the mixture so as to improve the thermal conductivities. The elaboration method consists of a physically mixing of salt powders with or without EG, and the composite PCMs were cold-compressed to form shape-stabilized PCMs at room temperature. The thermal conductivities of the composite PCMs fabricated by cold-compression were investigated at different temperatures by the steady state method.

The thermal conductivities of pure nitrates and nitrates/EG composite PCMs in solid state showed the behavior of temperature dependant, and they slightly decreased with the increase of the temperature.

Hydrometallurgy,"In this technical note, the adsorption of the gold-thiosulfate complex ion ([Au(S2O3)2]3 -) on cupric ferrocyanide (CuFC)-impregnated activated carbon in aqueous solutions was investigated to identify a better adsorbent for the gold thiosulfate process. This study was performed using cupric ferrocyanide (CuFC)-impregnated activated carbon (AC-CuFC) and an artificial, aqueous solution of [Au(S2O3)2]3 -. Variation in major factors was investigated for the determination of the appropriate dosages of cupric salts, potassium ferrocyanide, impregnation time and roasting temperature to obtain a high recovery of gold from simulated thiosulfate leach solutions. The experimental results have shown that [Au(S2O3)2]3 -strongly adsorbs onto the AC-CuFC and the adsorption capacity of [Au(S2O3)2]3 -on the AC-CuFC in aqueous solution increased with increasing temperature, leading to a gold adsorption capacity for AC-CuFC of 1.474 kg/t at a gold concentration of 100 mg/L at 30 °C. It was determined that the adsorption followed the Freundlich isotherm well, and a pseudo-second order kinetic model is suitable for the adsorption kinetic. That finding indicates that the gold adsorption is multimolecular chemical adsorption. EDX and FTIR suggested that the adsorption process consisted of two steps: first, [Au(S2O3)2]3 -diffused to the surface of AC-CuFC, and ion-exchange reaction for Au and Cu happened, then Au(I) was likely reduced to native gold by carbon or [Fe(CN)6]4 -. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Ecol. Indic.,"As resources become scarcer measuring resource productivity (RP) is more important. Quantifying the value of natural resources is challenging but the ecological footprint (EF) concept provides one method of uniformly describing a variety of natural resources. Current assessments of RP mainly revolve around output efficiency of resources, namely the ratio of GDP to natural resource usage.This paper develops a new method of calculating the RP by using the EF as an indicator of the natural resource input and gross domestic product (GDP) as the output in the equation of RP = GDP/EF. A regression analysis is carried out using GDP per capita and RP of China from 1997 to 2011, and a comparative analysis with the members of the G20 countries according to their RP and per capita GDP in 2008. The results indicate that RP correlates with the per capita GDP, showing that RP is a valid indicator which can be used to measure a country's level of economic development. © 2014 The Authors.

IEEE Sensors J.,"Capture effect is very common in passive radio frequency identification systems. Even though multiple tags transmit their signals to a reader simultaneously, one of the tags will be successfully identified due to capture effect. However, capture effect may hide some tags. Many existing algorithms that assume no capture effect will miss the hidden tags. In this paper, we extend an existing algorithm to the capture effect environment and propose a novel tag anticollision algorithm to enhance the efficiency of tag identification. The proposed algorithm adopts an allocation strategy to reduce collision between the hidden tags by capture effect and the other tags. The strategy lets the collided tags resolved in a current cycle immediately. On the other hand, the hidden tags will enter the next cycle. Thus, the resolved tags will not collide with the hidden tags in the next cycle, and the collision will be reduced. The experiment results show that the proposed protocol's identification efficiency outperforms other existing protocols when the occurrence probability of capture effect varies from 0.1 to 0.6. © 2014 IEEE.",,,20144600201220,,"Wu, Haifeng (1); Zeng, Yu (1) ","(1) School of Electrical and Information Technology, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming; 650500, China ",,716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 913.1 Production Engineering - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,,,,,Collision avoidance - Efficiency,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Haifeng ",10.1109/JSEN.2014.2339653,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,1530437X,1,January 2015,English,Radio frequency identification (RFID),,27.0,218-226,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Sensors Journal,,Passive RFID tag anticollision algorithm for capture effect,,Allocation strategy - Capture effect - Occurrence probability - Passive radio frequency identification systems - Passive RFID tags - Tag anti collisions - Tag anti-collision algorithms - Tag identification,15,
Res Policy,"Although prior research has highlighted the importance of academic collaborations in enhancing firms' innovation performance, it has largely focused on developed countries. As a result, how academic collaborations influence innovation in emerging countries, which differ fundamentally from developed countries in their institutional environment, remains unclear. We contribute to this literature by examining how collaborations with universities and research institutes influence the ability of Chinese emerging market enterprises (EMEs) to develop innovations. Our analysis challenges the assumption of institutional homogeneity within a given country, showing that institutions evolve in different ways across sub-national Chinese regions. This uneven institutional evolution affects the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs), the level of international openness, the quality of universities and research institutes across regions and thus the degree to which Chinese EMEs benefit from academic collaborations. Our findings reveal that sub-national institutional variations have a profound impact on the relationship between academic collaborations and firms' innovation performance, illustrate that some established assumptions are not valid in emerging countries, such as China, and offer insights into how EMEs can enhance their innovation performance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng,"We theoretically investigate the optoelectronic properties of graphene driven by an external DC electric field caused via in-plane source-drain voltage. It is found that the Drude part dominates the optical conductivity in the low-frequency region, whereas the plasmon effect can give rise to a relatively weak but observable the optical conductivity in the high-frequency region. Both the Drude and plasmon-induced parts of optical conductivity can be observed in the terahertz (THz) bandwidth. Drude part decreases monotonously with increasing of the photon frequency, the plasmon-induced part exhibits a peak at about ω~1 THz due to resonant plasmon-photon interaction in graphene. Moreover, we examined the dependence of plasmon-induced optical conductivity on the driving electric field and electron density and find that it depends sensitively on these parameters. It is indicated that the optical conductivity resulted from Drude and plasmon-induced parts in graphene can be tuned efficiently not only by electric gating but also by source-drain voltage.

Pattern Recogn. Lett.,"Due to the fact that limited amounts of labeled data are normally available in real-world, semi-supervised learning has become a popular option, where we expect to use unlabeled data information to improve the learning performance. However, how to use such unlabeled information to make the predicted labels more reliable remains to be a key for any successful learning. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework via combination of semi-supervised clustering and semi-supervised classification. In our approach, the predicted labels are selected by both the constrained k-means and safe semi-supervised SVM (S4VMs) to improve the reliability of the predicted labels. Extensive evaluations on collection of benchmarks and real-world action recognition datasets show that the proposed technique outperforms the others. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"Saccharopolyspora spinosa produces tetra-cyclic macrolide spinosyns, a group of highly efficient pesticidal agents. However, this species lacks efficient vectors for genetic manipulation. In this study, the circular plasmid pCM32 was newly isolated from Saccharopolyspora endophytica YIM 61095. The complete nucleotide sequence of pCM32 consists of 14,611 bp and is predicted to encode 17 open reading frames (ORFs). Interestingly, a putative int gene in pCM32 was predicted by homologous alignment to encode an integrase belonging to the tyrosine family of integrases/recombinases. Plasmid pCM238 containing this int locus derived from pCM32 could be transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli into Sa. spinosa at a high frequency. Integration of pCM238 in the host chromosome was demonstrated as site-specific recombination (at the tRNASergene) via a 56-bp core sequence within the attP/attB sites. Plasmid pCM265, a shuttle vector containing the int and attP sequences of pCM32, was constructed to introduce foreign genes into Sa. spinosa. The production of spinosad approximately doubled in Sa. spinosa NRRL18395 after introducing pCM265-derived plasmids carrying the genes for phosphofructokinase (PFK) or anthranilate synthase. These results indicate that plasmid pCM32 is an actinomycete integrative and conjugative element (AICE) and that its derived integrative vectors are useful for efficiently introducing foreign DNA into Sa. spinosa. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20153301165537,,"Chen, Jian (1); Xia, Haiyang (1, 3); Dang, Fujun (1); Xu, Qingyu (1); Li, Wenjun (2); Qin, Zhongjun (1, 3) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai; 200032, China (2) Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai; 200032, China ",AMBIDG,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.2 Calculus,,,,,Amino acids - Encoding (symbols) - Escherichia coli - Genes - Integration,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xia, Haiyang(hyxia@sibs.ac.cn) ",10.1007/s00253-015-6871-z,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320614,,,,01757598,23,"December 1, 2015",English,DNA,,32.0,10141-10149,,2015,Springer Verlag,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,,Characterization of the chromosomal integration of Saccharopolyspora plasmid pCM32 and its application to improve production of spinosyn in Saccharopolyspora spinosa,,Anthranilate synthase - Chromosomal integration - Genetic manipulations - Nucleotide sequences - Plasmid - Saccharopolyspora - Site-specific recombination - Spinosyn,99,
"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf. Big Data Cloud Comput., BDCloud","More and more legacy applications are migrated to federated hybrid clouds with the increasing popularity of cloud computing. Because cloud computing platforms offer high scalability and low maintenance cost. The reliability of cloud applications is still a challenging and critical research problem, although cloud infrastructures provide high reliability in terms of virtual machines. To solve the problem, an optimization framework for legacy applications migration is proposed. The framework consists of the component ranking algorithm, FTHCloud. The algorithm employs the application structure information, invocation frequency, failure impact, failure rate, response time and response data size of components. The top k components selected based on the ranking algorithm could be fault tolerant. In the paper, the formulated fault tolerance strategies including Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms can be automatically selected for these components. The experimental results show that the increase of reliability of several significant components according to these QoS values can improve the dependability of legacy applications in federate hybrid clouds. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161502230402,7310719.0,"Guo, Wei (1); Li, Jinyan (2) ","(1) School of Computing and Engineering, University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire; HD1 3DH, United Kingdom (2) National Pilot School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,443 Meteorology - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing,118494.0,"August 26, 2015 - August 28, 2015","Dalian, China","5th IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing, BDCloud 2015",Big data - Cloud computing - Clouds - Failure analysis - Software reliability - Web services,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/BDCloud.2015.42,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467371834.0,,,"October 27, 2015",English,Fault tolerance,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing, BDCloud 2015",31.0,76-81,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing, BDCloud 2015",IEEE Computer Society,Optimal Fault Tolerance Strategy Selection for Application Migration in Federated Hybrid Cloud,,Application migrations - Application structure - Byzantine fault tolerance - Cloud computing platforms - Cloud infrastructures - Critical researches - Optimal fault tolerances - Optimization framework,,

Acta Tabacaria Sin.,"Aphidius gifuensis is an important common parasitic natural enemy of aphids, especially of Myzus persicae. The morphology and ultrastructure of the sensilla on antennae, mouthparts, compound eyes and legs of Aphidius gifuensis were observed with scanning electron microscopy. Six morphogically distinct types of sensilla were found on Aphidius gifuensis, namely sensilla placoid, sensilla chaetica, sensilla trichoidea, sensilla basiconica, Böhm bristle and membranous arolium. There was no significant difference on sensilla between male and female. Sensilla trichoidea had the largest quantity and was most widely distributed, while Böhm bristle was only distributed in the antennal socket and the end of the coxa. Ontenna flagellums boasted the most types and largest quantity of the sensilla. ©, 2015, State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and China Tobacco Society.

Anal. Chem.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous materials assembled from metal ions and organic linkers. Recently, many studies have been focused on the syntheses of MOFs with permanent porosity for various applications. However, no attention has been paid to controllable disassembly of MOFs and related applications. In this work, for the first time we synthesized novel tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)-functionalized MOFs (i.e., RuMOFs) that could be ion-responsively disassembled and release massive guest materials loaded in the frameworks. The synthesized RuMOFs exhibited much stability in aqueous solutions containing H+, and many metal ions, but could be selectively and sensitively disassembled by Hg2+ions, resulting in the release of large quantities of Ru(bpy)32+. The target-responsive release mechanism was investigated and discussed in detail. On the basis of the ion-responsive disassembly and release, an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence sensing method for Hg2+has been developed with a very low limit of detection (5.3 × 10-13M). It was envisioned that the RuMOFs and similar target-responsive functional MOF materials would have promising applications in ultrasensitive and highly selective chemical sensing and even in accurately controllable drug delivering and releasing. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20151900828204,,"Lin, Xiaomei (1); Luo, Fenqiang (1); Zheng, Liyan (2); Gao, Gongmin (1); Chi, Yuwu (1) ","(1) MOE Key Laboratory of Analysis and Detection Technology for Food Safety, College of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian; 350108, China (2) Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource (Yunnan University), School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kun-ming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",ANCHAM,531.1 Metallurgy - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Chemical sensors - Crystalline materials - Metal ions - Metals - Microporous materials - Organometallics - Ruthenium compounds - Solutions - Targeted drug delivery,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chi, Yuwu(y.w.chi@fzu.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acs.analchem.5b00391,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15206882,,,,00032700,9,"May 5, 2015",English,Controlled drug delivery,,29.0,4864-4870,,2015,American Chemical Society,Analytical Chemistry,,"Fast, sensitive, and selective ion-triggered disassembly and release based on tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)-functionalized metal-organic frameworks",,Chemical sensing - Electrochemiluminescence - Limit of detection - Metal organic framework - Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) - Organic linkers - Release mechanism - Ultra sensitives,87,
J. Acoust. Soc. Am.,"Digit recognition was measured in quiet and in two noise conditions by English-native (EN) and Chinese-native (CN) listeners. EN listeners were tested using English digits and CN listeners were tested using both English and Chinese digits. In quiet, forward digit span recall worsened for both groups as the number of digits was increased. Significant effects of language experience were observed with five or more digits. Language experience had a significant effect on digit recognition in babble but not in steady noise. These results suggest that understanding of a nonnative language can be influenced by both cognitive load and listening environment. © 2015, Acoustical Society of America.

The separation coefficiente of Sn-Sb alloy, Viz. βSb were predicted. The calculated results show that Sn and Sb can be completely separated because βSb>>1. The evaluated vapor-liquid equilibrium diagram was used to predict the distributions of Sn and Sb in vapor and liquid phases during vacuum distillation.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"The technology of wireless body area network (WBAN) has attracted intensive attention in recent years. For widespread deployment of WBANs, security and privacy issues must be addressed properly. Recently, Hu et al. proposed a fuzzy attribute-based signcryption scheme with the aim to provide security and privacy mechanisms in WBANs. In this paper, we first show Hu et al.’s scheme cannot achieve the claimed security properties. In particular, an adversary is capable of generating private keys for any set of attributes. Then we introduce a new cryptographic primitive named ciphertext-policy attribute-based ring signcryption (CP-ABRSC) by integrating the notion of ciphertextpolicy attribute-based encryption with identity-based ring signature. We give formal syntax and security definitions for CP-ABRSC and present a provable secure CP-ABRSC scheme from bilinear pairings. Finally, we propose a novel access control framework for WBANs by exploiting CPABRSC scheme, which can not only provide semantic security, unforgeability and public authenticity, but also can provide participants privacy and fine-grained access control on encrypted health data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,20151500727196,,"Wang, Changji (1, 3); Xu, Xilei (2, 3); Li, Yuan (2, 3); Shi, Dongyuan (2, 3) ","(1) National Pilot School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China (3) Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China ",,"714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",115929.0,"December 13, 2014 - December 15, 2014","Beijing, China","10th International Conference on Information Security and Cryptology, Inscrypt 2014",Authentication - Chip scale packages - Public key cryptography - Semantics - Wireless local area networks (WLAN),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Changji(wchangji@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-16745-9_23,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319167442.0,03029743,,2015,English,Network security,,27.0,424-442,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,Integrating ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with identity-based ring signature to enhance security and privacy in wireless body area networks,,Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions - Cryptographic primitives - Fuzzy identities - Identity-based ring signatures - Security and privacy - Security and privacy issues - Signcryption schemes - Wireless body area network,8957,"Information Security and Cryptology - 10th International Conference, Inscrypt 2014, Revised Selected Papers"

Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue,"The vertical distribution characteristics of the pore water nitrogen concentration of the sediment from Dianchi Lake are studied, the nitrogen diffusion flux at its sediment-water interface was estimated quantitatively based on Fick diffusion law, and its influencing factors were also discussed. The results show: The total dissolved nitrogen of the sediment pore water from Dianchi Lake was mainly in the form of NH4+-N, accounting for 72.30%, With the increasing depth its concentration presented an increasing trend; followed by dissolved organic nitreogen (DON), accounting for 24.59%, with the increasing depth the concentration presented a trend of first increasing then decreasing gradually stabilized. NO3--N accounted for a lower proportion, and the concentration with depth increasing showed a decreasing trend. The amount of the NH4+-N diffused at sediment-water interface was between 12.73 and 59.74 mg/m2·d [With an average of 30.18 mg/(m2·d)]. The amount of the NH4+-N released was 3305.04 t per year for the whole lake, and those of Caohai, Northern, Northeast and South of Waihai were large, average 35 mg/(m2·d). Their spatial distribution presented decreasing trend from the north region to the south region gradually, the amount of the DON released was 1147.55 t annual, which had a similar spatial distribution with NH4+-N. The amount of the NO3--N diffusion flux was from -2.70 to 0.27 mg/(m2·d) [with an average of -0.50 mg/(m2·d)], and its releasing trend was from the overlying water to the sediment. Compared with other lakes in our country, the sediment from Dianchi Lake with the larger nitrogen concentration, its NH4+-N fluxes at sediment-water interface was higher, so there was the larger effect on the ammonia concentration of the overlying water. That was significantly positively correlation between its NH4+-N fluxes from the sediment with its total nitrogen, organic matter, exchangeable nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen content of exchangeable in sediment, so the NH4+-N released of the sediment from Dianchi Lake was mainly influenced by its exchangeable nitrogen, particularly ammonia nitrogen content. The potential risk of the DON release from sediment was large, which was correlated with its values of C/N in sediment significantly at the same time. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences.

J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol.,"Secretory leuckocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is thought as a regulating protein on the synthesis and degradation of matrix proteins. But there was no report of expression and function of SLPI on the tooth development, especially on the odontoblasts. As observed by in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, SLPI was expressed in odontoblasts and predentin on postnatal day 4 (PN4). On PN10, SLPI was observed under the dentin and apical region including odontoblasts processes. Further, on PN15, expression of SLPI was the same pattern compared to PN10. SLPI was expressed under layer of the odontoblasts and in odontoblasts on PN20. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 levels in SLPI/MDPC-23 cells were higher than that of the MDPC-23 cells. The gene expression of SLPI, bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OCN), osteonectin (ON), and collagen type I (Col I) was higher in SLPI/MDPC-23 than that of MDPC-23 cells and the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) was lower in SLPI/MDPC-23. Taken together, our results suggest that SLPI may be a MMP-2 and -9 regulating molecule in odontoblasts during dentin matrix formation and acts as a signaling molecule for dentin matrix related proteins during odontoblasts differentiation and mineralization.

Zhongguo Youse Jinshu Xuebao,"The small size bars of Ti-6Al-4V alloys (d10 mm) were prepared by high-speed rolling. The effects of solution and aging heat treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloy bars were investigated. The results show that the alloy bars are mainly composed of α phase and β phase. With the solution temperatures increase from 900 to 990 , the content of primary α phase decreases and the content of β phase increases, the microstructure transform procedure is observed in the alloy with the primary equiaxed α phase to the needle plexiform transformed β phase, and then to full lamellar transformed β phase. Furthermore, the tensile strength of the alloy gradually increases and the elongation significantly decreases. When the alloy is treated at the solution temperature of 930 and then aged at temperature from 450 to 650 , the transformed β phase constantly precipitates α phase, and the microstructure of the alloy is consisted of the (α+β) phase and β phase. Meanwhile, the α phase grows up, and then the microstructure becomes coarse. Furthermore, the tensile strength of the alloy decreases and the elongation increases. As a result, after the heat treatment of (930 , 30 min, WQ)+(550 , 4 h, AC), this alloy bars have optimum mechanical properties, the tensile strength is 1031 MPa and the elongation is 12.5%. ©, 2015, Central South University of Technology.

The fractal dimensionality, D value, of soil particle mass in plow layer was calculated with the fractal model of soil particle mass, the general characteristics, distribution, and its relationships with the texture, particle distribution and nutrients of soil were analyzed. The results indicated that D values ranged from 2.524 to 2.928 with the mean value of 2.823; soil types in the order of D value were light clay > heavy loam > medium loam > light loam; D value extremely significantly positively correlated to the mass percentage of clay particle (diameter 0.050 mm) and silt particle (diameter from 0.002 to 0.050 mm) in soil, as the percentage of clay particle increased by 10%, D values increased by 0.05 units; as the percentage of silt or sand particle increased by 10%, D value decreased by 0.09 or 0.06 units, respectively. D value of soil particle mass can directly reflect the constitution of soil particles to a certain extent. D value extremely significantly positively correlated to the contents of organic matter, total N, total K, total P, alkali-hydrolyzable N and available K, while extremely significantly negatively correlated to the content of available P in soil.

This study reports on the results of triaxial compression tests on methane hydrate bearing coal. The results show that the stress-strain relationships depend closely on the confining pressure. The failure strength linearly varies with the saturation. The higher the hydrate saturation is, the larger the internal friction angle is. The cementation between the coal and hydrate increases apparently when the saturation is high enough. The mechanical behavior of coal is improved after hydrate formation in the aspects of failure strength and the deformation elastic modulus. © 2015 ejge.",,,20160601893160,,"Gao, X. (1); Gao, C.

Firstly, similarities between the new project and the evaluated projects are obtained by calculating similarities of project name, project domain, project subject and project keywords respectively. Therefore, we get projects correlation between the new project and the evaluated projects. According to the projects correlation, we get the correlation between the new project and the experts who have participated in these projects evaluate. Then, experts professional ability value are obtained using information of basic qualifications, academic achievements, participat-ed projects and honors of experts what can be extracted from the experts' evidence documents. Finally, with the two factors of project correlation and professional ability, the expert recommended value is obtained, and the experts with the top recommend value are recommended for the new project evaluation.

Appl. Math. Model.,"The axisymmetric vibration of three kinds of zigzag, armchair and chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in water is studied in the paper based on the nonlocal anisotropic shell model. The present model is justified compared with the existing experimental observation and available data in literature. It is shown that for the tubes with the same diameter, the radial breathing frequencies from lower to upper limits are zigzag, chiral and armchair tubes, respectively. However, the difference in frequency diminishes with the increase of diameter. Furthermore, we found that the axisymmetric radial, longitudinal and torsional vibrational frequencies of SWCNTs are mainly sensitive to the values of radius and the scale coefficient, but cannot be substantially changed by their atomic structure. Moreover, we can get that the local shell model for CNT analysis would lead to an overprediction of the vibrational frequencies of almost all modes. So the nonlocal isotropic continuum models are practical in analyzing CNTs of large geometric sizes.

J. Biosci. Bioeng.,"Pollution with antibiotics poses a great risk to aquatic ecosystems. Although some toxic effects of antibiotics on photosystem II (PSII) have been documented, their toxicity to photosystem I (PSI) is still unclear. In this study, effects of ofloxacin on activities of both PSI and PSII of Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing) Kützing were investigated. Exposure to 0.1mgL-1ofloxacin led to increases in contents of chlorophyll a and carotenoids and photosynthetic activity of M.aeruginosa. PSI activity and its electron transport were not affected by 0.1mgL-1ofloxacin. When M.aeruginosa was exposed to ≥10mgL-1ofloxacin, the electron transport rates of PSI and PSII, the yield of cyclic electron flow (CEF) and the contribution of linear electron flow (LEF) to PSI decreased whereas Y(NA) (limitation of donor side of PSI) and Y(NO) (the quantum yield of non-regulated energy dissipation in PSII) significantly increased. CEF had a significant contribution to alleviating the inhibitory effect of ofloxacin on PSI of M.aeruginosa treated with low concentrations of ofloxacin. The protective role CEF for tolerance of PSI to the toxicity of ofloxacin decreased with increasing ofloxacin concentration. © 2014 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.",,,20150700523619,,"Deng, Chunnuan (1, 2); Pan, Xiangliang (2); Zhang, Daoyong (2, 3) ","(1) Key Lab of Plateau Lake Ecology and oGlobal Change, College of Tourism and Geographic Science, Yunnan Normal University, 768 Juxian Street, Kunming, China (2) Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Bioremediation, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 818 Beijingnan Road, Urumqi; 830011, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 46 Guanshui Road, Guiyang, China ",JBBIF6,454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 461.7 Health Care - 525.4 Energy Losses (industrial and residential) - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Antibiotics - Aquatic ecosystems - Bacteria - Chlorophyll - Energy dissipation - Photosynthesis - Quantum chemistry - Toxicity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pan, Xiangliang(panxl@ms.xjb.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.jbiosc.2014.07.014,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),13474421,"Number: 20125303120003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1120302, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 21177127, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by Program of 100 Distinguished Young Scientists of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( U1120302 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21177127 ) and Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education ( 20125303120003 ).",,13891723,2,"February 1, 2015",English,Electron transport properties,,57.0,159-164,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering,,Influence of ofloxacin on photosystems I and II activities of Microcystis aeruginosa and the potential role of cyclic electron flow,,Chlorophyll fluorescence - Cyanobacteria - Cyclic electron flow - Electron transport - Electron transport rate - Microcystis aeruginosa - Photosynthetic activity - Photosystem i,119,

Chem. Asian J.,"The development of new semiconductor photocatalysts toward splitting water has supplied a promising way to obtain sustainable and clean hydrogen energy. Herein, CdZnS@layered double hydroxide (LDH) composites with a hierarchical flower-like microstructure have been fabricated with the aid of ZnCr-LDH nanosheets as templates. XRD, SEM and HRTEM show that the ZnCr-LDH nanosheets are uniformly dispersed within the composites. The surface of the hierarchical structures is rough and composed of numerous nanocrystals of CdZnS. The HRTEM images indicate that the surface of CdZnS nanocrystals is mainly composed of the (111) plane. Moreover, the visible-light-driven H2production performance of the CdZnS in the presence and absence of ZnCr-LDH nanosheets has been measured. The results show that ZnCr-LDH nanosheets play an important role in the hierarchical morphology and photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples. In the water-splitting process, the visible-light-driven H2-production rate of hierarchical flowerlike CdZnS@LDH is 4.03 times and nearly 10 times higher than that of pristine CdZnS microsphere and pure commercial CdS, respectively. Therefore, this work not only achieves enhanced catalytic performance of the CdZnS by the introduction of ZnCr-LDH nanosheets, but also supplies an insight into the relationship between the hierarchical morphology and the semiconductor photocatalytic activity. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The growth processes and mechanism are explained as those insoluble zinc hydroxides prefer to nucleate on the surface of Fe3O4nanoparticles (heterogeneous nucleation) rather than nucleated as isolated ZnO nanostructures (homogeneous nucleation).

Appl. Energy,"Eutectic molten salt can be used as the latent thermal energy storage (LTES) medium in solar energy applications. In the present study, eutectic salt (50wt% NaNO3, 50wt% KNO3) with a melting temperature of about 220°C was employed as the PCM for the middle-temperature solar energy application, which can be powered by the parabolic-trough solar collector using oil as the heat transfer fluid. There are many LTES units in which the molten salt is encapsulated in the thermal energy storage tank, where the heat transfer characteristic of the LTES unit is very important for the overall performance of the entire thermal energy storage tank. We experimentally and numerically investigated the heat transfer characteristics of the molten-salt in a LTES unit with and without heat transfer enhancement. Various heating temperatures of 240°C, 250°C, and 260°C and cooling temperatures of 30°C, 70°C, and 110°C were employed in the study, so as to extensively reveal the heat transfer characteristics during heat storage and retrieval. It was found that natural convection was very dominant during heat storage in the case of pure molten-salt, especially when the heating temperature was higher, and it was weakened in the case of molten-salt with metal foam; while the heat retrieval process was enhanced by the presence of the metal foam. The numerical results were compared with the experimental results, showing reasonable agreement, which indicated that such numerical model could be used for the further study of the performance of the LTES system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20144900280297,,"Zhang, P.

Environ. Sci. Technol.,"Copper is used as a growth promoter in animal husbandry, resulting in high Cu concentrations in animal manure. We tested whether Cu would be mobilized in soils receiving excessive loads of manure, both from recently added and from aged fractions. To discriminate between these Cu sources, manure was labeled with65Cu. After soil application of 0, 15, and 30 Mg manure ha-1, leachate was collected in free-draining lysimeters (40 cm depth) under undisturbed soil over a 53 day period. Determining the total amounts of Cu and the fractions of65Cu in leachate and the soil profile enabled us to trace the translocation of Cu derived from labeled manure. More than 84% of the applied Cu was retained in the top 2 cm of soil. Less than 0.01% of the applied Cu was detected overall in the leachate. Of this amount, however, 38% (±8.9 SE) was leached within 8 days after application. The total Cu concentration in leachates (32-164 μg L-1) frequently exceeded the Chinese groundwater quality standard of 50 μg L-1. The added65Cu, however, accounted for less than 3.6% of the total Cu leaching load, suggesting that Cu from older sources and/or geological background controls contamination, regardless of current land management. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20151500731362,,"Ostermann, Anne (1); He, Yao (2); Siemens, Jan (2); Welp, Gerhard (2); Heuser, Alexander (3); Wombacher, Frank (3, 4); Münker, Carsten (3, 4); Xue, Qiaoyun (5); Lin, Xianyong (5); Amelung, Wulf (2) ","(1) Key Laboratory for Plant Biodiversity and Biogeography of East Asia (KLPB), Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Science, Kunming, Yunnan; 650201, China (2) Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES) - Soil Science and Soil Ecology, University of Bonn, Nussallee 13, Bonn; 53115, Germany (3) Steinmann Institute, Geochemistry University of Bonn, Poppelsdorfer Schloss, Bonn; 53115, Germany (4) Institut für Geologie und Mineralogie, Universität zu Köln, Zülpicher Str. 49b, Köln; 50674, Germany (5) College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, 866 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang; 310058, China ",ESTHAG,444.2 Groundwater - 445.2 Water Analysis - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 544.1 Copper - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 821.5 Agricultural Wastes,,,,,Animals - Copper - Fertilizers - Groundwater - Leaching - Manures - Water quality,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ostermann, Anne(ostermann@mail.kib.ac.cn) ",10.1021/es504945e,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205851,,,,0013936X,7,"April 7, 2015",English,Soils,,62.0,4609-4617,,2015,American Chemical Society,Environmental Science and Technology,,Tracing copper derived from pig manure in calcareous soils and soil leachates by65Cu labeling,,Animal husbandry - Calcareous soils - Cu concentrations - Geological background - Growth promoters - Land managements - Soil applications - Undisturbed soils,49,

Methods such as electron microscope, phase analyzing, tensile test, three dimension atom probe and so on were used to investigate the effect of vanadium on microstructure and tensile properties at both room temperature and high temperature up to 600 °C for different processes. The relationship between the microstructure and properties was analyzed. It has been found that the amount of vanadium precipitates would be raised as vanadium content rose. Adding vanadium into the steel was effective to increase the room temperature and elevated temperature yield strength, especially increased the content of nitrogen. Vanadium mainly exists in the pro-eutectoid ferrite of the test steel, the 'hidden' vanadium will precipitate from base microstructure when the temperature elevated to 600 °C, simultaneously improve the elevated temperature properties.

Acta Tabacaria Sin.,"Nicotina tobaccum L. cv. Yunyan 87, were pot-planted by using the same soil cultivation method in areas featuring different climate conditions, i. e. at the farm of Yunnan Agricultural University in Kunming (KM), at Jinzhuang in Yulong County of Lijiang (JZ) and at Pianjiao in Yongsheng county of Lijiang (PJ) respectively. Agronomic traits, SPAD values and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) were determined at vigorous growth period; differential expressed proteins (DEPs) of tobacco leaves were analyzed with methods of iTRAQ and their mRNA level was further verified by q-RT-PCR amplification. Proteomic analysis data obtained by iTRAQ showed that DEPs in leaves mainly existed in metabolism of carbon, nitrogen and stress response. Compared with KM, proteins associated reaction of photosynthesis were upregulated while enzymes related to respiratory pathway for sugar consumption were down-regulated in PJ; proteins related to pathway of gluconeogenesis was increased, while enzymes associated respiratory pathways were reduced in PJ; and in both PJ and JZ, enzymes associated to biosynthesis of amino acids and proteins were down-regulated, while the ones related to degradation of amino acids and proteins were up-regulated. mRNA level of six randomly selected DEPs was confirmed to have similar expressional trend by q-RTPCR detection verifying the accuracy of proteomic results obtained by iTRAQ. It is also suggested that Lijiang tobacco, which is represented by tobacco of both PJ and KM, accumulate more carbohydrates with reduced content of nitrogen compounds, such as amino acids and proteins in their leaves. This study will help understand the effects of local climate on development of Lijiang tobacco leaves featuring high ratio of carbon and nitrogen content by using methods of proteomics. ©, 2015, State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and China Tobacco Society.

Zhongguo Jiguang,"Molecular vibration spectrum is an important fingerprint for the identification of material properties and characteristics, which has been widely used to determine molecular structure, identify unknown compounds and analyze hybrid components. A molecular vibration spectroscopy sensor based on the graphene nanoribbon arrays is presented, and validated by numerical simulation. The results show that the transmission bandwidth of the graphene nanoribbon arrays can be flexibly controlled via tuning the chemical potential, period and duty ratio. The transmission coefficient of the sensor is consistent with the corresponding absorption spectrum after deposition of sample substance in the detected zone, which allows for the identification of molecular fingerprint. Moreover, the sensor has good robustness since the envelope of the transmission coefficient is independent on the thickness of the deposited sample substance. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Energy,"This paper presents a straightforward method for assessing the uniformity and mixing time of bubbles based on uniform design in a direct contact heat exchanger. The evolution of bubbles movement is experimentally tracked using an imaging technique that is processed in the Matlab software to obtain the local bubble concentration. The local discrepancy of a set of bubbles seems to be a useful concept to measure the difference between theory and empirical distribution. The UC (uniformity coefficient) is associated with a discrepancy, leading to a useful parameter to characterise the mixture homogeneity and mixing time. To determine the impact of expressions, iteration steps and pixels on the measurement, evolution of UC response frames are investigated. The mixing time and uniformity obtained by UC method were compared with data obtained by Betti numbers method. The simulations and experiments between local and global uniform (with the same Betti numbers) are discussed and examples are given for illustration. The results show that the space-time features of the mixing process have been successfully derived by UC method. The UC curves bring new insights to study and compare mixing efficiency of different systems, which has a high degree of reliability, and can yield accurate mixing information. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd",,,20162602545270,,"Fei, Yu (1); Xiao, Qingtai (2); Xu, Jianxin (2); Pan, Jianxin (3); Wang, Shibo (2); Wang, Hua (2); Huang, Junwei (4) ","(1) School of Statistics and Mathematics, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) School of Mathematics, The University of Manchester, Manchester; M13 9PL, United Kingdom (4) Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; 650201, China ",ENEYDS,616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 913.1 Production Engineering - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Efficiency - Heat exchangers - Heat transfer - Iterative methods - MATLAB - Uranium compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Jianxin(xujianxina@163.com) ",10.1016/j.energy.2015.10.126,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FB020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 11061036, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51406071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank the referees for their constructive criticism.

The reaction of Ph2PN(SiMe3)2with DMAD gives only the acyclic alkene Me3SiN=P(Ph2)(MeO2C)C=C(CO2Me)SiMe3(9), which is similar to 8a,b. In these reactions, compounds 1a-4a and 1b-4b behave as N-geminal P/Si-based Lewis pairs, which undergo a dipolar cycloaddition reaction with the alkyne. The theoretical calculations indicate that the reactions proceed through a concerted cycloaddition reaction mechanism. The stability of these heterocycles decreases as the number of the Me substituent on the pentacoordinated Si atom increases. When the Si center is substituted with three Me groups (4a,b), the heterocyclic intermediates undergo ring opening by Si-N bond cleavage and concomitant N=P bond formation resulting in 8a,b.

Neiranji Gongcheng,"Through an atmosphere simulation system, an experimental investigation on the effect of EGR on the power performance, fuel economy and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with pure diesel fuel and B15E5 oxygenated fuel was conducted in 81 kPa and 100 kPa pressure environments. The test results show that the power of the diesel engine fueled with pure diesel declines obviously when using EGR and the torque in 81 kPa pressure environment drops more than that in 100 kPa pressure environment. The power performance of the engine fueled with B15E5 fuel drops seriously at the maximum torque speed, and the peak torque disappears when using EGR. The influence of EGR on fuel economy of the diesel engine fueled with pure diesel is not obvious and the fuel economy of the engine fueled with B15E5 is worse. The fuel consumption of the diesel engine fueled with pure diesel increases at 81 kPa and declines at 100 kPa at low loads with EGR. The NOx emission of the diesel engine fueled with pure diesel significantly declines by using EGR, and it falls greater with the increase of load. Soot and CO emissions of both fuels are significantly increased by using EGR. And the soot and CO emissions of the B15E5 fuel are significantly lower than those of the pure diesel. Soot and CO emissions of both fuels at 81 kPa are higher than those at 100 kPa.

Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng,"The basic features of phosphorescent emission from Ir(ppy)3(ppy=2-phenylpyridinate), dissolved in THF, were investigated by a magneto-luminescence technique. It is found that there are two peaks in the phosphorescent spectra in visible region from 2.2~77 K. They are located at 547.70 nm and 515.70 nm wavelength. This is due to radiative electronic transition from two substates in3MLCT structure to the ground state of Ir(ppy)3. Changing temperature can vary electron distribution and life-time on different substates in the3MLCT structure of Ir(ppy)3.Thus, we can observe a strong dependence of the phosphorescent spectrum on temperature. Furthermore, we find that the intensity of phosphorescent emission from Ir(ppy)3increases with magnetic field at 2.2 K. The presence of the high magnetic field can alter the electronic states and, thus, modulate the electron distribution and transition possibility for substates in3MLCT. As a result, the phosphorescence emission from Ir(ppy)3can be enhanced by the presence of the magnetic field. © 2015, Science Press.

Chem. Asian J.,"A highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (H7N9 AIV) detection was proposed by using electrochemical magnetoimmunoassay coupled with biometallization and anodic stripping voltammetry. This strategy could accumulate the enzyme-generated product on the surface of the magneto electrode by means of silver deposition, which amplified the detection signal about 80 times. The use of magnetic beads (MBs) and the magneto electrode could also amplify the detection signal. Furthermore, a bi-electrode signal transduction system was introduced into this immunosensor, which is also beneficial to the immunoassay. A concentration as low as 0.011ngmL-1of H7N9 AIV could be detected in about 1.5h with good specificity. This study not only provides a simple and sensitive approach for virus detection but also offers an effective signal enhancement strategy for the development of highly sensitive MB-based electrochemical immunoassays. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"Fast and non-destructive measurements of tobacco leaf pigment contents by spectroscopy in situ in the field has great significance in production guidance for nutrient diagnosis and growth monitoring of tobacco in vegetative growth stage, and it is also very important for the quality evaluation of tobacco leaves in mature stage. The purpose of this study is to estimate the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of tobacco leaves using tobacco leaf spectrum collected in the field. Reflectance spectrum of tobacco leaves in vegetative growth stage and mature stage were collected in situ in the field and the pigment contents of tobacco leaf samples were measured in this study, taking the tobacco leaf samples collected in each and both stages as modeling sets respectively, and using the methods of support vector machine (SVM) and spectral indice to establish the pigment content estimation models, and then compare the prediction performance of the models built by different methods. The study results indicated that the difference of estimation performance by each stage or mixed stages is not significant. For chlorophyll content, SVM and spectral indice modeling methods can both have a well estimation performance, while for carotenoid content, SVM modeling method has a better estimation performance than spectral indice. The coefficient of determination and the root mean square error of SVM model for estimating tobacco leaf chlorophyll content by each stage were 0.867 6 and 0.014 7, while the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error of SVM model for estimating tobacco leaf chlorophyll content by mixed stages were 0.898 6 and 0.012 3; The coefficient of determination and the root mean square error for estimating tobacco leaf carotenoid content by each stage were 0.861 4 and 0.002 5, while the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error of SVM model for estimating tobacco leaf carotenoid content by mixed stages were 0.839 9 and 0.002 5. The innovation point of this study is that on the basis of support vector machine and spectral indice, models established by each stage and mixed stages for estimating the pigment contents of tobacco leaf samples can provide scientific basis and technical support for quality control of tobacco leaf production in field and the ensurance of tobacco leaf recovery quality. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Anal. Methods,"A facile hydrothermal method has been developed for the synthesis of nanosized Cu-CeO2composites with various Cu contents. The obtained catalysts, with a Cu/CeO2atomic ratio in the range of 0-40%, were characterized as to their structure, morphology, and redox features by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2physisorption, and temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen. The experimental results show that the particles are highly crystalline CeO2nanopowders of 5-8 nm primary particle size and the Cu nanoparticles indeed coexist with the CeO2nanoparticles (cubic fluorite CeO2). The influence of Cu contents on their catalytic performance for CO oxidation was also studied. As for the catalytic reactivity, nanosized Cu-CeO2composites have a higher catalytic activity than CeO2in CO oxidation. It is ascribed to the effect between the cycle transition of Ce4+/Ce3+, oxygen vacancies and surface area, which are induced by copper. The catalytic activity of the Cu-CeO2composites exhibits Cu content dependence where the best catalytic activity occurs at a Cu/CeO2atomic ratio of 30%. In addition, nanosized Cu-CeO2composites also show high catalytic activity for selective oxidation of CO in excess H2at relatively low temperature.

Chem. Eng. Trans.,"As an important part of the debt financing decision, the choice of debt maturity structure will not only affect investment and financing cost, corporate governance and liquidity risk, but also be directly related to the distribution of interests between the creditor and debtor. In fact, debt maturity structure can be regarded as an endogenous result of one social economic system in a particular development stage. Therefore, it owns important theoretical significance and application value to study the effect of institutional environments on debt maturity structure. Using theoretical analysis, this paper introduces institutional environments into the standard debt maturity model established by Holmstrom and Tirole (1998, 2000).

Int. J. Grid Distrib. Comput.,"Currently, the combined push-pull model is usually applied in the resource monitoring under cloud computing environment. However, the quantity of data gathered by the producers is much less than those received by the monitor so that a lot of resource is wasted. In order to maintain the data consistency of real time system, an improved adaptive algorithm based on combined push-pull model is proposed. The adaptive strategy is added on the producers that aims to predict when refreshes data came from the monitor using the history data.

This study aimed to evaluate the drug-excipient compatibility of binary mixtures (BMs) (1:1 BMs, w/w), initially by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and subsequently, by complementary techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) if there was any evidence of interaction. The samples were stored under accelerated stability conditions (40°C at 75 % relative humidity). The DSC curves of estradiol and the BMs with excipients (corn starch, lactose, xanthan gum, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, dibasic calcium phosphate, and talc) were obtained. The results show that estradiol was compatible with all the selected excipients. XRPD and HPLC analysis were instrumental in interpreting the DSC results and excluding relevant pharmaceutical incompatibilities in all cases.

Nucl Instrum Methods Phys Res Sect A,"Abstract In this paper, a front-end electronics based on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is presented for the future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). To achieve this purpose, a 16-channel ASIC chip, PARISROC 2 (Photomultiplier ARray Integrated in SiGe ReadOut Chip) is used in the analog signal processing and digitization. The digitized results are sent to the server by a user-defined User Datagram Protocol/Internet Protocol (UDP/IP) hardcore engine through Ethernet that is managed by a FPGA. A prototype electronics fulfilling the requirements of the Wide Field of View Cherenkov Telescope Array (WFCTA) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) project has been designed, fabricated and tested to prove the concept of the design. A detailed description of the development with the results of the test measurements are presented. By using a new input structure and a new configuration of the ASIC, the dynamic range of the circuit is extended. A highly precise-time calibrating algorithm is also proposed, verified and optimized for the mass production. The test results suggest that the proposed electronics design fulfills the general specification of the future IACTs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20152701004003,57821.0,"Chen, Y.T.

RSC Adv.,"Red phosphor Cs2GeF6:Mn4+has been synthesized by the cation exchange method. The as-prepared phosphor was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Its optical properties were investigated by photo-luminescence spectra (PL), diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), the low-temperature emission spectrum and the luminescence decay curve.

Comput. Sci. Applic. Proc. Asia Pac. Comput. Sci. Applic. Conf.,"In recent years, geometric active contour model based on the energy functional has widely been used in image segmentation. Region Scalable Fitting (RSF) model can draw upon intensity information in local regions at a controllable scale and use the Gaussian function as the local region kernel function to fit the energy functional. RSF model can produce more accurate location of the object boundaries with a smaller scale, and has desirable performance for image with weak object boundaries. But RSF model may easily converge to the pseudo boundary and is sensitive to the noise and initial position when it is used in segmenting the small and scattered meteorological objects. In this paper, we modify the RSF model by using a phase congruence function as the boundary detection term, and redefine RSF energy functional by putting a total variance regular function into the gradient descent flow equation. We call this functional as PRSF model. Some experimental results show that PRSF model can integrate the features of area and active contour effectively, and also extract small object boundaries which is non-sensitive to the noise and the initial position. We use PRSF model to segment the meteorological objects with Split Bregman algorithm, to implement the meteorological object segmentation fast computing. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20154201380896,,"Zhang, Jie (1); Lei, Jiankun (2); Jiang, Murong (2); Qiu, Jie (2); Chen, Yuanlong (2); Wang, Zhiheng (2) ","(1) Yunnan Meteorological Information Center, Kunming, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,,122869.0,"December 27, 2014 - December 28, 2014","Shanghai, China","Proceedings of the Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Applications, CSAC 2014",Computer science - Computers,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jiang, Murong(jiangmr@ynu.edu.cn) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781138028111.0,,,2015,English,Image segmentation,"Computer Science and Applications - Proceedings of the Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Applications, CSAC 2014",13.0,269-274,1 of 1,2015,CRC Press/Balkema,"Computer Science and Applications - Proceedings of the Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Applications, CSAC 2014",,Modify region scalable fitting model for meteorological object segmentation,,Boundary detection - Energy functionals - Gaussian functions - Geometric active contours - Gradient descent flows - Intensity information - Object segmentation - Split bregman algorithms,,

Appl Surf Sci,"We present a study of the evolution of self-assembled SiGe islands grown on a microcrystalline Si (μc-Si)-based mixed-phase pre-SiGe island layer. Using atomic force microscopy, lots of new short islands with smaller diameters, high islands with transition dome (TD) shape, and super islands with ∼20 nm in height are observed after the Ge layer deposition. This anomalous experimental finding is well clarified by a model of regeneration and secondary growth. It is found that the density of the super islands increases rapidly at the initial stage when the Ge coverage exceeds ∼1.2 nm. This is essentially the result of the selective aggregation of Ge adatoms on the pre-SiGe island layer. The Ge content and stored strain in SiGe islands calculated based on Raman spectra decrease with the increase of the Ge coverage. It is demonstrated that the chemical potential difference-induced lateral atomic migration (LAM) from amorphous SiGe alloy into SiGe islands can be responsible for this phenomenon. The LAM also leads to the formation of very large dome islands. Finally, the overlap behavior of neighbor islands in the sample with 2.2 nm-thick Ge layer is explained by the combined action of denser nucleation centers, faster growth rates of super islands in lateral direction, and coarsening of neighbor small islands. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Energy Policy,"In Xishuangbanna, China, rubber production has spread rapidly, resulting in extensive land use changes and an increasing influx of migrant workers who have come to find work on the plantations. These migrant workers have limited access to subsidies and the local collective forest due to the household registration system in China called hukou. To assess how these policy-based restrictions on access affect wood consumption and local communities, a case study was conducted in Manlin village, Xishuangbanna, undertaking a household and weight survey with local and immigrant households. The results show no significant difference in firewood consumption between the subpopulations, despite predominantly more local than immigrant households have access to subsidised alternative energy sources. On the other hand, limited access to the collective forest is found to influence the choice of housing materials and living standards in immigrant households as they cannot access timber or afford brick houses. This paper highlights rural issues connected to the hukou system and suggests that rural energy and resource policies should take the growing population of immigrant workers into consideration in future to expand the reach of the polices to the de facto and not only de jure rural population and thus optimise policy efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20151100623299,,"Mertens, Charlotte Filt (1); Bruun, Thilde Bech (2); Schmidt-Vogt, Dietrich (3, 4); He, Jun (3); de Neergaard, Andreas (2) ","(1) University of Copenhagen, Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, Oster Voldgade 10, Copenhagen K; 1350, Denmark (2) Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, Frederiksberg C; 1871, Denmark (3) Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 132# Lanhei Road, Heilongtan, Kunming, Yunnan; 650201, China (4) World Agroforestry Centre, East and Central Asia Region, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China ",ENPYAC,403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 811.2 Wood and Wood Products - 818.1 Natural Rubber,,,,,Land use - Rubber plantations - Rural areas - Wood,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Mertens, Charlotte Filt(charlottefiltmertens@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.040,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Oticon Fonden; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the input of the I-REDD+ team who helped provide context and background information.

Utilizing AutoCAD, geometry parameters of cladding coating height, width and cladding angle are marked to explore the effects of laser specific energy, amplitude and frequency of mechanical vibration on cladding angle. By means of second-order polynomial of response surface analysis method, a function model being able to express the relationship among cladding angle, laser specific energy, amplitude and frequency is established. Results show that the cladding angle of laser cladding coating is greater when combined with mechanical vibration. Provided with the same laser specific energy and amplitude of vibration, the cladding angle under frequency of 200 Hz is larger than the one with frequency of 100 Hz, and the cladding angle reaches the minimum value when the amplitude is 0.10 mm. The calculated value of cladding angle using the least squares function models is superior to the existing geometry model by being closer to the actual measurement result. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Int. J. Simul. Syst. Sci. Technol.,"As wireless sensor networks become applied more and more widely, the existing security system certification structure hasn’t already met the needs of wireless sensor networks. In order to accommodate wireless sensor network to current application environment, people shall attach more importance on enhancing its securities and lowering communications cost calculation. On the grounds that its resources is limited and transport energy consumption is much larger than other communication network characteristics, we adopt a low coupling ECC algorithms and mutual authentication. In this paper, the author found that compared with traditional algorithms, low coupling ECC algorithm is optimized in doing the dot product, the remaining square determination as well as changing the key update. Hence the security strength of the same communication, the key length significantly reduced, while corresponding special space is relatively small, which means the capabilities fight against cyber-attack capabilities become stronger. In the same network, the improved ECC algorithm handles more encryption and decryption algorithm than conventional ECC algorithms does. Therefore, its safety has been effectively improved.

Diangong Jishu Xuebao,"In order to promote the application of mixed insulation oil in transformers, the preparation method of a new anti-aging mixed insulation oil with mass production has been developed. Then two kinds of oil-paper insulation samples were prepared with common insulation pressboard and insulation oil, namely new mixed insulation oil and mineral oil respectively. Accelerated aging experiments were performed under the 130 to analysis their dielectric properties, breakdown voltage and the general characteristics of aging products. The results show that: the properties of new mixed insulation oil meet the requirements of GB 2536-2011 and it can delay the aging process of oil-paper insulation system. The breakdown voltages of new mixed insulation oil and its impregnated insulation pressboard at different aging time are mostly higher than that of relevant mineral oil and its impregnated insulation pressboard respectively. With the increase of temperature, the breakdown voltages of two kinds of insulation pressboard at early aging time decrease while at later aging time decrease firstly and then increase. The relative dielectric constant and the ratio of relative dielectric constants of new mixed insulation oil and its impregnated insulation pressboard at different aging time are higher than that of relevant mineral oil and its impregnated insulation pressboard. This indicates that new mixed insulation oil improves the distribution uniformity of electric field in insulation oil and insulation pressboard, which is helpful to the miniaturization of transformer manufacturing. © 2015, The editorial office of Transaction of China Electrotechnical Society.

Ventilation - Proc. Int. Conf. Ind. Vent.,"Passengers and drivers have high exposures to in-vehicle air pollution such as ultrafine particles (UFPs), volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon oxides and nitrogen oxides which can result in potentially adverse health risks, and ventilation is an effective way to decrease the risks and to improve vehicular IAQ. Vehicles have three main ventilation modes such as air-conditioning with interior air recirculation (ACI), air-conditioning with fresh air intake (ACF) and natural ventilation with open windows (NVO). ACI mode can reduce in-vehicle UFPs and NO2from ambient atmosphere, but the exhaled CO2from passengers and drivers and the emitted VOC from interior materials can quickly accumulate in vehicular interior air. Using ACF and NVO modes instead can provide sufficient air exchange to prevent the CO2and VOC buildup, but concentrations of UFPs, black carbon, nitrogen oxides and CO in vehicles would increase when road traffic is heavy and out-vehicle air is polluted by exhaust emissions. Out-vehicle or atmospheric pollutants ingress into vehicles are strongly dependent on the rate at which the vehicles are ventilated with outdoor air. In addition, through NVO mode, exhaust gases from vehicle emissions and fume pollution from vehicle engine can be diffused back into vehicle interior and accumulate in vehicular cabins. Moreover, two special ventilation modes such as automated ventilation system (AVS) and retrofit crankcase ventilation (RCV) are discussed, the AVS is quite effective to avoid the unpleasant exposure to exhaust fume from ambient running vehicles, and the RCV is effective at reducing concentrations of UFPs, formaldehyde and organic carbon in public buses. While ventilation is not the sole determinant of improving vehicular IAQ, ventilation plays a leading role. Certainly, the degree of leading role depends on ambient atmospheric pollution, vehicle exhaust emissions and climate conditions. Therefore, it is very important to choose and use a suitable ventilation mode in different driving environment.",,,20163902831822,,"Chen, Xiaokai (1); Feng, Lili (2) ","(1) College of Civil Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (2) School of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",,"432 Highway Transportation - 451 Air Pollution - 461.7 Health Care - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 643.3 Air Conditioning - 643.5 Ventilation - 662.1 Automobiles - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds",123370.0,"October 26, 2015 - October 28, 2015","Shanghai, China","11th International Conference on Industrial Ventilation, Ventilation 2015",Air conditioning - Air intakes - Air quality - Automobile drivers - Automobile manufacture - Carbon dioxide - Exhaust gases - Health risks - Indoor air pollution - Nitrogen oxides - Organic carbon - Vehicles - Ventilation exhausts - Volatile organic compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Xiaokai(ccxk@qq.com) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 2014M562512XB, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 51568026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This study is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51568026) and by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2014M562512XB),9780000000002.0,,,2015,English,Ventilation,Ventilation 2015 - Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Industrial Ventilation,18.0,920-928,2of2,2015,International Conference on Industrial Ventilation,Ventilation 2015 - Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Industrial Ventilation,"ASHRAE; China Committee of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (CCHVAC); et al.; Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations (REHVA); International Society of Indoor Air Quality and Climate (ISIAQ); ISBE",A research review on ventilation and indoor air quality of vehicles,,Atmospheric pollutants - Atmospheric pollution - Driving environment - Indoor air quality - Mechanical ventilation - Natural ventilation - Vehicle exhaust emissions - Volatile organic compound (VOC),2,
ICEIEC - Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Electron. Inf. Emerg. Commun.,"In molecular biology, many effective representations have been used for sub-nuclear location. However, these representations, containing only single characterize of protein, make the information for classification insufficient. Inspired by this fact, we propose two integrated representations by feature fusion method in the expectation of extracting richer information from the protein sequence. Concretely, we combine pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) with position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and then obtain two fused representations, called briefly PseAACGreyPSSM and PseAACPsePSSM. Both the proposed representations, thus, include the protein amphiphilic factors and the biological evolution information. We, with feature vectors of protein samples, adopt the K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for predicting.

IEEE Trans. Cybern.,"Image pair analysis provides significant image pair priori which describes the dependency between training image pairs for various learning-based image processing. For avoiding the information loss caused by vectorizing training images, a novel matrix-value operator learning method is proposed for image pair analysis. Sample-dependent operators, named image pair operators (IPOs) by us, are employed to represent the local image-to-image dependency defined by each of the training image pairs. A linear combination of IPOs is learned via operator regression for representing the global dependency between input and output images defined by all of the training image pairs. The proposed operator learning method enjoys the image-level information of training image pairs because IPOs enable training images to be used without vectorizing during the learning and testing process. By applying the proposed algorithm in learning-based super-resolution, the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in learning image pair information is verified by experimental results. © 2013 IEEE.",,,20150400458665,7017516.0,"Tang, Yi (1); Yuan, Yuan (2) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Center for Optical Imagery Analysis and Learning, State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Xi'an; 710119, China ",,912.4 Personnel,,,,,Learning systems - Personnel training,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Yi ",10.1109/TCYB.2014.2363882,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,21682267,10,October 2015,English,Image analysis,,59.0,2042-2050,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,,Image pair analysis with matrix-value operator,,Image pairs - Information loss - Input and outputs - Learning-based super-resolution - Linear combinations - Operator learning - Testing process - Training image,45,

Soil Tillage Res.,"Subsoil acidity seriously inhibits the development of agriculture and forestry in southern China. However, there are few effective methods for amelioration of subsoil acidity. In order to develop low cost and efficient methods for amelioration of subsoil acidity through surface application of amendments, a column leaching experiment and an in situ field experiment were conducted to investigate the amelioration effects of surface application of alkaline slag (AS) and phosphogypsum (PG) on the soil properties in an Ultisol profile. AS increased soil pH and base saturation, and decreased exchangeable acidity of the different segments in the soil profile to different degrees. Since AS contains a high content of soluble chloride, the quick leaching of chloride ions promoted the migration of base cations in the amendments through the soil profile, the exchange of base cations with exchangeable aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn), and the leaching of soluble Al and Mn out of the profile. Although PG could increase the soil exchangeable calcium (Ca), PG significantly increased the soluble Al and Mn in the Ultisol profile. Compared with PG, AS was more effective in decreasing soil acidity and soluble Al and Mn, and increasing exchangeable Ca and magnesium (Mg) in the Ultisol profile. Therefore, AS was superior to PG in ameliorating soil acidity in the surface soil and subsoil of this Ultisol. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20150200409394,,"Li, Jiu-yu (1); Liu, Zhao-dong (1); Zhao, Wen-zhi (2); Masud, M.M.

Gongneng Cailiao,"The analysis of response curves in phase space is an effective way to get information on the dynamical evolution of the sensor. In this paper, the response curves of a single La3+-doped SnO2nanobelt gas sensor in the time domain are transformed into the characteristic curves of it in phase space. The feature parameters are calibrated in phase space and then the gas sensing dynamic behaviors of a single La3+-doped SnO2nanobelt device are analyzed systematically. The results are as follows: (1) The single La3+-doped SnO2nanobelt device has good resiliences to acetone, ethanol and ethanediol; (2) It has a high sensitivity and an excellent selectivity especially to ethanediol; (3) The adsorption efficiency behaves insufficiently as the ethanediol concentration increases, but the desorption efficiency is obvious, indicating a repulsive effect, and the device is not an ideal 'dependent' gas sensor. The dynamical characteristics and pattern recognition of the ideal sensor are given by the phase space analysis so that the theoretical guidance and judgment are provided to design and prepare the 'dependent' gas sensor. © 2015, Journal of Functional Materials.

Gaodianya Jishu,"To monitor the temperature state of the long distance overhead line in real time, we developed an integrated distributed optical fiber sensing system based on the Brillouin optical time domain reflectometer (BOTDR) distributed fiber sensing technology. In the laboratory environment, the system has a maximum sensing distance of 30 km, a temperature resolution of ±2 , and a temperature measurement range from -60 to 90, while the spatial resolution is 10 m. We used the system to conduct the temperature field test for the optical power ground wire (OPGW) of 110 kV lines in 19 hours and compared the test results of 15. 4 km location with the results of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor. The results show that, this system can detect the distributed temperature of OPGW cable in the site environment, and the results are basically in agreement with the local temperature variation trend. In the place of 15.4 km, the monitoring result is consistent with the temperature profile of the FBG sensors, and the biggest difference is 1.8. Affected by the fiber production process and splices loss, the segmentation phenomenon appears on the Brillouin scattering spectra and the maximum sensing distance of field test is only 16 km.

Prog. in Filtr. and Sep.,"Magnetic separation, as a powerful technique for the manipulation of magnetic particles, has attracted worldwide attentions and achieved tremendous applications in the past several decades, due to its effectiveness, simple operation, low cost, and environmental sustainability. In the field of mineral processing, magnetic separation is mainly used for concentration of magnetic components and for removal of magnetic impurities, under dry or wet conditions. Basic theoretical principle of magnetic separations and three types of magnetic separators, i.e., low-intensity, high-intensity, and high-gradient magnetic separators, and their technological innovations and operational practices are reviewed. In particular, pulsating high-gradient magnetic separation, a landmark progress in the treatment of fine weakly magnetic minerals such as iron oxide ores and ilmenite, and its continual developments and operational variables are expatiated. Practical cases in the processing of typically magnetic ores, i.e., magnetite, hematite, limonite, ilmenite and nonmetallic ores where magnetic techniques are well embodied, are introduced. At the end of this chapter, the merits and limitations of current magnetic techniques and the future trends in the research and development of potential magnetic techniques are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

IEEE Trans. Cybern.,"Bayesian network (BN) has been adopted as the underlying model for representing and inferring uncertain knowledge. As the basis of realistic applications centered on probabilistic inferences, learning a BN from data is a critical subject of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data paradigms. Currently, it is necessary to extend the classical methods for learning BNs with respect to data-intensive computing or in cloud environments. In this paper, we propose a parallel and incremental approach for data-intensive learning of BNs from massive, distributed, and dynamically changing data by extending the classical scoring and search algorithm and using MapReduce. First, we adopt the minimum description length as the scoring metric and give the two-pass MapReduce-based algorithms for computing the required marginal probabilities and scoring the candidate graphical model from sample data. Then, we give the corresponding strategy for extending the classical hill-climbing algorithm to obtain the optimal structure, as well as that for storing a BN by pairs. Further, in view of the dynamic characteristics of the changing data, we give the concept of influence degree to measure the coincidence of the current BN with new data, and then propose the corresponding two-pass MapReduce-based algorithms for BNs incremental learning. Experimental results show the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our methods. © 2013 IEEE.",,,20150500463902,7018001.0,"Yue, Kun (1); Fang, Qiyu (1); Wang, Xiaoling (2); Li, Jin (3); Liu, Weiyi (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Institute of Massive Computing, East China Normal University, Shanghai; 200062, China (3) Department of Software Engineering, School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 921.5 Optimization Techniques",,,,,Artificial intelligence - Barium compounds - Bayesian networks - Evolutionary algorithms - Learning algorithms - Learning systems - Parallel algorithms - Structural optimization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yue, Kun(kyue@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1109/TCYB.2015.2388791,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,21682267,12,December 2015,English,Big data,,40.0,2890-2904,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,,A parallel and incremental approach for data-intensive learning of Bayesian networks,,Bayesian network learning - Data-intensive computing - Incremental learning - Map-reduce - Uncertain knowledge,45,
Sci. China Earth Sci.,"Based on a comprehensive analysis on Sonic Anemometer and gradient data, wind profile radar (WPR) and GPS sounding data of March–August 2008 from the boundary layer (BL) tower observation system at Dali on the southeastern edge of Tibetan Plateau (TP), it is found that the strengths of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), buoyancy term and shear term depend on vegetation cover in association with local stability and thermodynamic condition. Strong kinetic turbulence appears when near surface layer in neutral condition with the large contribution from shear term. In an unstable condition within near surface layer, the atmospheric turbulent motion is mainly thermal turbulence, as buoyancy term is obviously larger than shear term. Under a stable condition the intermittent turbulence is accompanied by weak shear and buoyancy term, and TKE is significantly less than neutral or instable condition. The study also presents that the buoyancy term contribution at Nyingchi station in the southern slopes of the TP large topography in spring is significantly larger than that at Dali over the southeastern TP edge, reflecting that the thermal turbulence makes an important contribution to convection activity in the southern slopes of TP. Dali station is located in complex terrain with mountain and valley leading to larger kinetic turbulence. From the perspective of interaction of turbulence-convection in different scales, the study revealed that the height of convective boundary layer (CBL) could reach up to 1500–2000 m. TKE, shear term, and buoyancy term in near surface layer have the notable correlations with BL height and local vertical motion. The daytime thermodynamic turbulence effect of heat flux and buoyancy term has an obvious impact on the height of CBL, whereas mechanical turbulence only exerts a less impact. Mechanical turbulence in near surface layer has a significant impact on vertical motion especially in the forenoon with impacting height of 2500–3000 m. The peaks in diurnal variations of shear term and buoyancy term correspond to the high instable periods, especially in summer forenoon. Our observation analysis characterized the convection activity triggered by TKE source and their interaction in the southeastern TP edge. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20151000597251,,"Wang, Yin Jun (1, 2); Xu, Xiang De (1); Zhao, Tian Liang (2); Sun, Ji Hua (3); Yao, Wen Qing (1); Zhou, Ming Yu (4, 5) ","(1) Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS), Beijing; 100081, China (2) Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing; 210044, China (3) Meteorological Institute of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650034, China (4) National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center, Beijing; 100081, China (5) National Climate Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing; 100081, China ",,"481.1 Geology - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 716.2 Radar Systems and Equipment - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Boundary layer flow - Boundary layers - Buoyancy - Heat flux - Kinetic energy - Kinetics - Landforms - Radar - Turbulence,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Xiang De(xuxd@cams.cma.gov.cn) ",10.1007/s11430-015-5054-1,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18691897,,,,16747313,7,"July 1, 2015",English,Atmospheric thermodynamics,,26.0,1198-1209,,2015,Science in China Press,Science China Earth Sciences,,Structures of convection and turbulent kinetic energy in boundary layer over the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau,,Boundary layer heights - Comprehensive analysis - Convective boundary layers - Mechanical turbulence - Thermodynamic conditions - TKE equation terms - Turbulent kinetic energy - Wind profiles,58,

Ecol. Model.,"Lake eutrophication is associated with excessive nutrient enrichment and unobserved internal nutrient cycling. In spite of advances in understanding the role of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling in eutrophication, the relative importance of N and P limitation and release from sediment is still an open question. The complicated interaction between N and P cycling and external driving factors leads to dynamics in N or P limitation patterns and internal release that change over time. We developed a nutrient-driven model of phytoplankton dynamics including the critical nutrient cycling processes. It was fitted using Bayesian inference to explore the roles of N and P inputs from external sources, net sediment release, and internal dynamics in Lake Yilong, a shallow eutrophic lake in China. The model provided a good fit to observations, with time-varying parameters required to fit time-dependent variations in the sediment release process. The results demonstrated that, in Lake Yilong, the pattern of nutrient limitation showed a transformation from P limitation to N and P co-limitation after an observed regime shift occurred in 2008. After the shift in 2008, sediment release had an increasing influence on N and P supply, which could make eutrophication remediation more difficult. For Lake Yilong, it would not be possible to reverse eutrophication solely with watershed nutrient load reduction so in-lake manipulation of physical-chemical conditions to inhibit the sediments release should also be considered. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20152801028855,,"Li, Yuzhao (1); Liu, Yong (1); Zhao, Lei (2); Hastings, Alan (3); Guo, Huaicheng (1) ","(1) College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (MOE), Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China (3) Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, 1 Shields Avenue, Davis; CA; 95616, United States ",ECMODT,"471 Marine Science and Oceanography - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 723.4.1 Expert Systems - 921 Mathematics - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Bayesian networks - Dynamic models - Dynamics - Eutrophication - Inference engines - Lakes - Phytoplankton - Sediments,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Yong(yongliu@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.06.025,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: W911NF-13-1-0305, Acronym: ARO, Sponsor: Army Research Office; Number: 2015CB458900, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: A2, Acronym: CICREQ, Sponsor: Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality; Number: A1, Acronym: CICREQ, Sponsor: Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality; Number: 41222002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Dr. Arhonditsis for Bayesian inference instructions, Zhongyao Liang for helpful advice on change point analysis, Zhen Wu for helpful advice on modeling development, Gellner Gabriel for helpful on text check.

J Cryst Growth,"γ′-Fe4N thin films with good soft magnetic properties were successfully prepared on single crystal Si(1 0 0) and GaAs(1 0 0) substrates with Fe buffer layer by facing target magnetron sputtering. The microstructure and magnetic properties of the samples at low temperature were investigated. Both structural and magnetic properties of the films were shown to be influenced by the substrate. Specifically, the film deposited on the GaAs exhibited a strong preferred orientation along the (1 0 0) plane, while the film deposited on Si exhibited higher saturation magnetization (Ms) and lower coercivity (Hc). The results suggest that the coercivity is probably related to the intrinsic stress and that Ms increases whereas Hc decreases with decreasing lattice mismatch.

Rock Soil Mech,"Contact angle is a basic physical variable of the three-phase interface. Unsaturated soil is a typical three-phase matter. The research on contact angle in unsaturated soil is at the beginning stage. In general, contact angle is supposed as a constant or overlooked. Actually the contact angle will change with the external environment. The contact angle of sand will increase with surface modification. The surface property of sand is altered from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. The apparent contact angle of sand increases by mixing the hydrophobic sand into normal sand. The mixture is used for preparation of samples. The suction measurement tests on samples with different contact angles are conducted. The results indicate that the contact angle has important effect on matric suction in unsaturated soil. When the water content at the same value, the matric suction decreases with the increasing of contact angle. When the water content reaches a certain value, matric suction would not be affected by the contact angle of sand (under hydrophilic condition). When the contact angle reaches a threshold value, the matric suction disappears. The negative pore water pressure does not exist in unsaturated soil. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

The variation laws of wind speeds and wind directions at wind observation points near bridge tower under different inflow wind speeds and directions were analyzed, and the correction values of wind speed and wind angle were given. The research results indicate that bridge tower affects the measurement results of wind sensors obviously, and the locations of wind sensors should be optimized. Wind speed ratio fluctuates from 0.45 to 1.30 when wind sensors are located in the upstream, and it changes from 0.05 to 1.25 when they are located in the downstream.

Remote Sens.,"Accurate and up-to-date mapping and monitoring of rubber plantations is challenging. In this study, we presented a simple method for rapidly and accurately mapping rubber plantations in the Xishuangbanna region of southwest China using phenology-based vegetation index differencing. Temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and Tasselled Cap Greenness (TCG) for rubber trees, natural forests and croplands were constructed using 11 Landsat 8 OLI images acquired within one year. These vegetation index time series accurately demonstrated the unique seasonal phenological dynamics of rubber trees. Two distinct phenological phases (i.e., defoliation and foliation) of rubber trees were clearly distinguishable from natural forests and croplands. Rubber trees undergo a brief defoliation-foliation process between late December and mid-March. Therefore, vegetation index differencing between the nearly complete defoliation (leaf-off) and full foliation (leaf flushing) phases was used to delineate rubber plantations within fragmented tropical mountainous landscapes. The method presented herein greatly improved rubber plantation classification accuracy. Overall classification accuracies derived from the differences of the five vegetation indices varied from 92% to 96% with corresponding kappa coefficients of 0.84-0.92. These results demonstrate the promising potential of phenology-based vegetation index differencing for mapping and monitoring rubber expansion at the regional scale. © 2015 by the authors.",,Open Access,20152200898185,,"Fan, Hui (1); Fu, Xiaohua (1); Zhang, Zheng (1); Wu, Qiong (1) ","(1) Asian International Rivers Center of Yunnan University, Yunnan Key Laboratory of International Rivers and Transboundary Eco-Security, Kunming; 650091, China ",,405.3 Surveying - 818.1 Natural Rubber,,,,,Forestry - Image enhancement - Mapping - Rubber - Vegetation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fan, Hui(huifancoast@gmail.com) ",10.3390/rs70506041,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20724292,,,,,5,2015,English,Rubber plantations,,56.0,6041-6058,,2015,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Remote Sensing,,Phenology-based vegetation index differencing for mapping of rubber plantations using landsat OLI data,,Image differencing - Lancang-Mekong - LANDSAT - Phenology - Thresholding - Xishuangbanna,7,
Gaodianya Jishu,"To satisfy the requirements of ultra-high frequency (UHF) partial discharge on-line monitoring, we proposed a novel smart sensor for UHF partial discharge online detection based on stacked multiple-arm Hilbert fractal antenna and level scanning system. Moreover, we improved the traditional Hilbert fractal patch by adding parasitic arm and cascading patch structure, and designed a cascading multiple-arm Hilbert fractal antenna with small size, wide frequency band and high gain, which was used as the antenna of smart sensor. The level scanning module for data collection obtained by level scanning method was used as the data acquisition unit of smart sensor. The needle-plate discharge experiment in air was carried out in laboratory, and the full waveform signal sample method and the smart sensor were used to capture and process the signal simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed smart sensor can process the UHF partial discharge signal quickly and directly, output the partial discharge figures with small amount of output data, and lower the cost of hardware and small volume of equipment. The discharge figures obtained by the two methods are nearly same, which proves that the smart sensor can capture and process the partial discharge signal accurately. © 2015, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPI.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Context. The observations of the synchrotron emission from the supernova remnant (SNR) SN 1006 indicate a bilateral morphology, which is mainly characterized by two opposite bright limbs with knots and filaments along the boundary of the remnant. The morphology is not strictly circular with disturbances and bumps at the rim of the remnant. For instance, one big bump is located on the northeastern (NE) limb and several relatively small ones on the southwestern (SW) limb on the detected morphologies from the observations in the radio and X-rays. Aims. The generation of the asymmetric morphology of non-thermal X-rays for SN 1006 is investigated through three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Moreover, the density distribution of the ambient material can be investigated by comparing the resulting synchrotron morphology with the detected images of the hard X-ray emission. Methods. First, the remnant was simulated as a supernova explosion evolved in a turbulent plasma with a relatively small amplitude for the turbulence. In the model, several spherical cavities with lower densities compared with the background plasma were employed to reproduce the detected bumps at the bright limbs. Second, the effect of the modification on the morphology of the remnant due to efficient cosmic ray acceleration was investigated by adopting a lower adiabatic index. Results. If we assume that the injection efficiency of electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration process at the shock follows the quasi-parallel scenario, the hard X-ray morphology of SN 1006 with bumps in the bright NE and SW regions can be generally reproduced by employing cavities in the background medium in the non-modification scenario. Furthermore, in the modification case with a lower adiabatic index of 1.2 for the remnant evolved in a uniform medium, bubbles can be produced with relatively small extensions on the SNR boundary that result from the hydrodynamical instabilities that in turn overtake the forward shock. Conclusions. The SNR propagating in the turbulent medium with a relatively small amplitude can reproduce the knotty and filamentary morphology of the remnant better than what evolved in the uniform environment; moreover, the big bump on the NE limb can be explained as the result of a lower-density region, which has a radius of about 2.5 pc and a density of about 0.4 times of the general ambient medium, swept by the shock front, and the other smaller ones on the SW limb can either be reproduced with smaller regions with lower densities swept by the shock or be explained as the protrusions in the scenario of the efficient cosmic ray acceleration when the instability fingers effectively overtake the forward shock. © ESO, 2015.",,Open Access,20152700988467,A35,"Yu, Huan (1, 2); Fang, Jun (1, 2); Zhang, Peng Fei (1); Zhang, Li (1) ","(1) Department of Astronomy, Key Laboratory of Astroparticle Physics of Yunnan Province, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Key Laboratory for the Structron and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China ",AAEJAF,615.3 Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) Power Generation - 657 Space Physics - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 932.3 Plasma Physics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Cosmic rays - Cosmology - Magnetohydrodynamics - Magnetoplasma - Morphology - Plasma turbulence - Supernovae,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1051/0004-6361/201424857,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320746,,,,00046361,,"July 1, 2015",English,X rays,,58.0,,,2015,EDP Sciences,Astronomy and Astrophysics,,Three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic studies of the non-thermal X-ray morphologies of SN 1006,,Density distributions - Diffusive shock accelerations - Injection efficiency - Ism: individual objects: sn 1006 - ISM: supernova remnants - Magnetohydrodynamic simulations - Radiation mechanisms: non thermal - Threedimensional (3-d),579,

First, the possible reactions of Sn-clusters at 1273~2073 K and 10 Pa, and Gibbs free energies were calculatedwith HSCchemistry 5.1 software. Next, the ground-state geometries of the Sn-clusters were optimized in density functional theory (DFT) with generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. Finally, the Sn-clusters with optimized geometries were modeled, calculated in molecular dynamics, and simulated in DFT with Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code of Material Studio. Besides, the structures and bond-lengths of Sn-clusters, before and after the simulation, and the evaporation behavior of S2were evaluated.

Remote Sens.,"The distribution of C3 and C4 vegetation plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and climate change. Knowledge of the distribution of C3 and C4 vegetation at a high spatial resolution over local or regional scales helps us to understand their ecological functions and climate dependencies. In this study, we classified C3 and C4 vegetation at a high resolution for spatially heterogeneous landscapes. First, we generated a high spatial and temporal land surface reflectance dataset by blending MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) data. The blended data exhibited a high correlation (R2= 0.88) with the satellite derived ETM+ data. The time-series NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data were then generated using the blended high spatio-temporal resolution data to capture the phenological differences between the C3 and C4 vegetation. The time-series NDVI revealed that the C3 vegetation turns green earlier in spring than the C4 vegetation, and senesces later in autumn than the C4 vegetation. C4 vegetation has a higher NDVI value than the C3 vegetation during summer time. Based on the distinguished characteristics, the time-series NDVI was used to extract the C3 and C4 classification features. Five features were selected from the 18 classification features according to the ground investigation data, and subsequently used for the C3 and C4 classification.

In the present study, the coding sequence and the 50- and 30-untranslated regions of MHC class II DR alpha chain (the DRA gene) from rare gayal and gaytle were cloned and analyzed to dissect structural and functional variations. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the DRA genes in gayal (Bofr-DRA) and gaytle (Bofr × BoLA-DRA) were almost identical to those for cattle and yak (99%). Compared to yak, two amino acids substitutions in the signal peptide (SP) domain for gayal were found within all Bos animals. Except for only one replacement in the amino acid within the a2 domain of the DRA protein in gayal, the additional residues were highly conserved across the species investigated. The 20 peptide-binding sites (PBS) of Bofr-DRA and Bofr × BoLA-DRA were essentially reserved in the a1 domain among all species investigated. The lesser degree of substitution in Bofr-DRA is concordant with the concept that the DRA gene is highly conserved among all mammals. The very high degree of conservativity of the DRA gene among ruminants, including gayal, suggests its recent evolutionary separation. © 2014 The Author(s).

J. Harbin Inst. Technol.,"To solve the shortest path planning problems on grid-based map efficiently, a novel heuristic path planning approach based on an intelligent swarm optimization method called Multivariant Optimization Algorithm (MOA) and a modified indirect encoding scheme are proposed. In MOA, the solution space is iteratively searched through global exploration and local exploitation by intelligent searching individuals, who are named as atoms. MOA is employed to locate the shortest path through iterations of global path planning and local path refinements in the proposed path planning approach. In each iteration, a group of global atoms are employed to perform the global path planning aiming at finding some candidate paths rapidly and then a group of local atoms are allotted to each candidate path for refinement. Further, the traditional indirect encoding scheme is modified to reduce the possibility of constructing an infeasible path from an array. Comparative experiments against two other frequently use intelligent optimization approaches: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are conducted on benchmark test problems of varying complexity to evaluate the performance of MOA. The results demonstrate that MOA outperforms GA and PSO in terms of optimality indicated by the length of the located path. ©, 2015, Harbin Institute of Technology.

Opt. Express,"A novel optical method was applied to measure the binary liquid diffusion coefficient (D) quickly. Equipped with an asymmetric liquid-core cylindrical lens (ALCL), the spatially resolving ability of the ALCL in measuring refractive index of liquid was utilized to obtain the gradient distribution of the liquid concentration along diffusive direction. Based on Fick's second law, the D value was then calculated by analyzing diffusion images. It was worth mentioning that only one instantaneous diffusive image was required to measure D value by the method, reducing the measurement time greatly from several hours in traditional methods to a few seconds. The diffusion coefficients of ethylene glycol diffusing in pure water, at temperatures from 288.15 to 308.15 K, were measured by analyzing instantaneous diffusion images, the results were consistent well with the values measured by using holographic interferometry and Taylor dispersion methods. The method is characterized by faster measurement, direct observation of diffusive process, and easy operation, which provides a new method in measuring diffusion coefficient of liquids rapidly. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,,20160701925120,,"Sun, Licun (1); Meng, Weidong (1); Pu, Xiaoyun (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,741.1 Light/Optics - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Holographic interferometry - Image analysis - Liquids - Refractive index,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1364/OE.23.023155,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10944087,,,,,18,"September 7, 2015",English,Diffusion,,23.0,23155-23166,,2015,OSA - The Optical Society,Optics Express,,New method to measure liquid diffusivity by analyzing an instantaneous diffusion image,,Diffusive process - Direct observations - Fick's second law - Gradient distributions - Liquid concentration - Liquid diffusivity - Resolving ability - Taylor dispersion method,23,

The target is to ensure that the possibility of a unit's restoration in its start-up time requirements is no less than a certain level of confidence, and to obtain the optimized network that reaches the highest reliability in a shortest possible time.

Zongguo Gonglu Xuebao,"In order to solve the problems of methods in Chinese Codes to calculate the normal section bearing capacity of RC circular members, such as inconvenience and certain errors caused by simplification, a practical calculation method was derived. Based on five strain areas of bearing capacity under ultimate limit state, the inverse method with no iteration calculating the internal forces from the deformation was derived by equilibrium condition, with strain as the independent variable. A whole parabola-rectangle concrete stress-strain relationship and the ideal elastic-plastic constitutive relationship for reinforcement were considered in this method. The dimensionless moment-axial force nomogram was then obtained by graph algorithm at the range from ultimate tension to compression. The results show that the nomogram is simple and convenient in use and the results agree well with those methods in Chinese Codes. ©, 2015, Xi'an Highway University.

J. Biol. Chem.,"Repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)-dependent transcription by the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) is important for homeostatic expression of PPARγ target genes in vivo. The current model states that NCoR-mediated repression requires its direct interaction with PPARy in the repressive conformation. Previous studies, however, have shown that DNA-bound PPARγ is incompatible with a direct, high-affinity association with NCoR because of the inherent ability of PPARγ to adopt the active conformation. Here we show that NCoR acquires the ability to repress active PPARγ-mediated transcription via G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), a component of the NCoR corepressor complex. Unlike NCoR, GPS2 can recognize and bind the active state of PPARγ. In GPS2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, loss of GPS2 markedly reduces the corepressor function of NCoR for PPARγ, leading to constitutive activation of PPARγ target genes and spontaneous adipogenesis of the cells. GPS2, however, is dispensable for repression mediated by unliganded thyroid hormone receptor α or a PPARγ mutant unable to adopt the active conformation. This study shows that GPS2, although dispensable for the intrinsic repression function of NCoR, can mediate a novel corepressor repression pathway that allows NCoR to directly repress active PPARγ-mediated transcription, which is important for the optimal corepressor function of NCoR for PPARγ. Interestingly, GPS2-dependent repression specifically targets PPARγ but not PPARα or PPARδ. Therefore, GPS2 may serve as a unique target to manipulate PPARγ signaling in diseases. © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,Open Access,20150700510573,,"Guo, Chun (1, 2); Li, Yali (2, 6); Gow, Chien-Hung (2, 3); Wong, Madeline (1); Zha, Jikun (1); Yan, Chunxia (2, 4); Liu, Hongqi (5); Wang, Yongjun (1); Burris, Thomas P.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Aims. Outflows from accretion disks have been suggested to be suitable sites for producing heavy elements. The objective of this work is to investigate nucleosynthesis in the outflows launched from the inner accretion disks of collapsars that are associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Methods. By using a collapsar model of advection-dominated accretion and an adiabatic expanding outflow model, we simulated chemical yields inside the outflows associated with GRBs. As a result of the extremely high temperature (above 1010K), the dominated species existing in the inner region of the disk are proton, neutron,2H, and4He, which are photodisintegrated from heavy nuclei. Assuming that an explosive nucleosynthesis could operate in outflows from collapsar accretions associated with GRBs, heavier species including the iron-group will be synthesized significantly. Although various outflow models have been investigated carefully in the past, the uncertainties in predicting the outflow birthplace (ejected-radius rj) in the accretion disk are still quite large. Unlike recent researches on this topic that located the production of heavy elements in GRBs in the outer parts of the disk, in this study we focus our attention mainly on the outflows triggered from the inner region of collapsar accretion. Results. We find56Ni can be abundantly produced in all the outflow cases considered here from the inner collapsar disk. The highest56Ni's mass fraction in the outflows reaches 0.463, which can imply that the56Ni-rich outflows will lead to an observable violent explosion of a GRB event. The mass fractions of57Ni,59Cu (decays to59Ni), and60Zn (decays to60Ni) could be 10-2, and the abundance of58Ni reaches 10-3. Our simulations support that the effective production of heavy elements can occur in the outflows from the inner regions of the collapsar accretion disks. Our results also show that the amount of heavy species produced in outflows depends on the eject-radius rjof the accretion disk where the outflows take place; outflows launched at larger radii can be helpful to increase the quantities of heavy nuclei by means of the lower disk temperature, which agrees with the conclusions of recent studies. Furthermore, a recently published article reported that some nuclei, such as28Si,32S,36Ar,40Ca,44Ti,48Cr,54Fe, and55-56Co, experience a dip and then rise in their mass fraction while evolving in the outflow, and this characteristic behavior has occurred in many more outflow cases, and this is reported for the first time in the literature. This characteristic phenomenon also occurs in our nucleosynthetic simulations. © ESO, 2015.",,Open Access,20152600970968,A132,"Hu, Tao (1, 2) ","(1) Department of Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai; 200072, China (2) Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yunnan Observatories, Kunming; 650011, China ",AAEJAF,657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 932.2 Nuclear Physics,,,,,Chemical elements - Nucleosynthesis - Stars,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hu, Tao ",10.1051/0004-6361/201425167,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320746,,,,00046361,,"June 1, 2015",English,Gamma rays,,110.0,,,2015,EDP Sciences,Astronomy and Astrophysics,,Elemental abundances associated with gamma-ray bursts: Nucleosynthesis in outflows,,"Disk temperatures - Elemental abundance - Galaxies: abundances - Gamma ray bursts - Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) - Nuclear reactions , nucleosynthesis , abundances - Recent researches - Stars: abundances",578,
Guangxue Xuebao,"The corrugated metal parallel plate waveguide composed by two parallel plates with subwavelength corrugations on both surfaces shows some similarities and differences with plasmon-assisted parallel plate waveguide are confirmed. A symmetrical corrugated metal parallel plate waveguide with gradually changed depth of corrugations is designed to convert electromagnetic wave between transmission mode and surface mode. Due to the field distribution and the power flow are concentrated on the corrugated surface at the intermediate region of the waveguide, a cylindrical perfect electric conductor put into the center of the waveguide does not affect its field distribution and transmission characteristics, namely the waveguide has stealth effect. The cutoff frequency of the upper sideband of corrugated metal parallel plate waveguide's band gap changes linearly with the permittivity of sample substance which is filled in the corrugations, and therefore it can be used in dielectric sensing. The terahertz sensing characteristics are confirmed by the detection of samples such as diesel, liquid paraffin and olive oil.

FT-IR spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and mahalanobis distance were developed for determining the authenticity of VWO, and all the accuracy rates of three models are 100%; Meanwhile, validation samples were used to predict the results by the models, and all the prediction accuracy rates are 100%. The partial least square (PLS) model was further used to predict the levels of these vegetable oils in independent samples for validation purpose. PLS models correlate the actual and FT-IR estimated values of oil adulterants (SO, PO and SFO) with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.990 8, 0.994 4, 0.995 5 respectively. The RMSEC values of SO, PO and SFO in VWO obtained are 0.032 7, 0.023 5 and 0.019 6, respectively.

Hangkong Xuebao,"To meet the demands for hard real time and high tracking accuracy in dynamic path planning problems, a solver based on the improved multivariant optimization algorithm (IMOA) which can simultaneously locate and track multiple optimal and sub-optimal paths is proposed. Firstly, the dynamic path planning problems are transferred into the dynamic optimization problems by defining a path with a Bezier curve. Then, the probability of tracking different optimal and sub-optimal solutions simultaneously is improved through introducing a similarity check operation into multivariate optimization algorithm (MOA). Finally, the IMOA is applied to optimize the control points of Bezier curve. Experiment results show that once the optimal path becomes less optimal or infeasible, the IMOA, by making use of its characteristics of tracking multiple dynamic optimal and suboptimal solutions, has the ability to quickly adjust optimization strategy to refine other suboptimal paths in the purpose of finding the optimal path again. What is more, the overall offline performance is improved compared with other algorithms. The presented IMOA method is adaptable to the dynamic path planning problems and meets the real demands in dynamic environments. ©, 2015, AAAS Press of Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

J. Sep. Sci.,"C19-diterpenoid alkaloids are the main components of Aconitum duclouxii Levl. The process of separation and purification of these compounds in previous studies was tedious and time consuming, requiring multiple chromatographic steps, thus resulted in low recovery and high cost. In the present work, five C19-diterpenoid alkaloids, namely, benzoylaconine (1), N-deethylaconitine (2), aconitine (3), deoxyaconitine (4), and ducloudine A (5), were efficiently prepared from A. duclouxii Levl (Aconitum L.) by ethyl acetate extraction followed with counter-current chromatography. In the process of separation, the critical conditions of counter-current chromatography were optimized. The two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water/NH3·H2O (25%) (1:1:1:1:0.1, v/v) was selected and 148.2 mg of 1, 24.1 mg of 2, 250.6 mg of 3, 73.9 mg of 4, and 31.4 mg of 5 were obtained from 1 g total Aconitum alkaloids extract, respectively, in a single run within 4 h.

Energy Procedia,"The theoretical analysis and experimental research on the thermal performance of the solar air collector with finned absorber are made in this paper. The effects of setting angle, medium flow and air inlet mode on solar air collector performance are analyzed, and the theory calculation model of it is confirmed by experimentation. The results show that the error between the theory calculation model and the experiment test maintains at around 9%. The results of calculation and analysis on thermal performance of this collector through theory calculation model indicate that setting angle has no influence on the thermal efficiency, while medium flow has a positive relation with it. In addition, heat-collecting efficiency can be improved by the negative pressure in the collector, but it is dropped along with the pressure going up. In sum, the fin plat solar air collector can be widely applied because it can be the medium-low temperature heat source for the solar drying systems. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,,20164803056390,,"Chang, Wei (1); Wang, Yunfeng (2); Li, Ming (2); Luo, Xi (2); Ruan, Yongbao (1); Hong, Yongrui (1); Zhang, Shaobo (1) ","(1) School of Physics and Electronic Information Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Solar Energy Research Institute, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,641.1 Thermodynamics - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 913.1 Production Engineering,132430.0,"October 13, 2014 - October 15, 2014","Beijing, China","3rd International Conference on Solar Heating and Cooling for Buildings and Industry, SHC 2014",Efficiency - Solar heating - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Ming(liming@ynnu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.egypro.2015.02.092,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,,18766102,,2015,English,Collector efficiency,,16.0,13-22,1of1,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Energy Procedia,,The Theoretical and Experimental Research on Thermal Performance of Solar Air Collector with Finned Absorber,,Collecting efficiency - Experimental research - Low temperature heat sources - Solar air collector - Solar drying systems - Theory calculation - thermal character - Thermal Performance,70,"Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Solar Heating and Cooling for Buildings and Industry, SHC 2014"
Procedia Comput. Sci.,"Photovoltaic generation is one of the promising renewable sources and is deployed in more and more power systems. Like other distributed generation, solar panels are connected to distribution systems instead of transmission systems. Distribution systems are inherently unbalanced, so the power flow studies must consider three phases. The interface between solar panel and distribution system is a DC-DC converter and an inverter, which are normally designed provided that the system is balanced. This paper analyses the output power of solar panel under both balanced and unbalanced PCC voltages and found the three-phase powers are not equal and unity power factor control cannot be realized when PCC voltages are unbalanced while the controller works well when PCC voltages are balanced. The results of simulation conform to the analysis. The work of this paper shows that simple P-Q solar panel models are not good for distribution system power flow studies, and present unity power factor controller does not work well for solar panel connected to distribution systems. © 2015 The Authors.

Short Pap.","Compared to the categorical approach that represents affective states as several discrete classes (e.g., positive and negative), the dimensional approach represents affective states as continuous numerical values on multiple dimensions, such as the valence-arousal (VA) space, thus allowing for more fine-grained sentiment analysis. In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Therefore, this study proposes a weighted graph model that considers both the relations of multiple nodes and their similarities as weights to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words. Experiments on both English and Chinese affective lexicons show that the proposed method yielded a smaller error rate on VA prediction than the linear regression, kernel method, and pagerank algorithm used in previous studies. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,,20171403523855,,"Yu, Liang-Chih (1, 3); Wang, Jin (2, 3, 4); Robert Lai, K.

RSC Adv.,"Fe-based modified activated carbon prepared by impregnation was used for adsorbents in Hg0purification. The influence of carriers, active components, FeCl3solution concentration and calcination temperature, were investigated for Hg0adsorption purification. The effects of the preparation conditions on the adsorbent were characterized by N2adsorption-desorption isotherms, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and (FTIR). The samples modified with FeCl3showed an obvious performance for Hg0removal, because the chlorine in metal chlorides acts as an oxidant that promotes the conversion of elemental mercury (Hg0) into its oxidized form (Hg2+). The mechanisms of mercury adsorption onto the Cl-impregnated activated carbon were proposed. The optimal conditions for adsorptive purification are an Fe3+concentration of 0.15 mol L-1, calcination temperature of 300 °C at an adsorption temperature of 40°C and carrier gas flow rate of 300 mL min-1.

Wuli Xuebao,"The Ni50-xFexMn37In13(x=1, 3, 5) polycrystalline samples are prepared by arc melting method. The martensitic transformations and crystal structures for Ni50-xFexMn37In13(x = 1, 3, 5) samples are systematically analyzed by measuring the structure and magnetism. The results show that the three samples present different structures at room temperature. In the mean time, with the increase of the content of Fe, the martensitic transformation temperature rapidly decreases, while the ferromagnetism is gradually enhanced for these alloys. Furthermore, both the magnetoresistance and the magnetocaloric effect are also investigated in Fe3 and Fe5 alloys. For an applied magnetic field of 3 T, it is found that the magnetoresistance effects of two samples are about -46% and -15%, while their isothermal entropy changes are about 6 J·kg-1and 9.5 J·kg-1·K-1during reverse martensitic transformation, respectively.

TMS Annu Meet,"Zinc recovery from zinc oxide flue dust (ZOFD) by ultrasound enhanced neutral leaching process was investigated. In this study, the effects of leaching temperature, liquid/solid ratio, leaching time and ultrasound power were studied, and the conventional leaching experiments were also performed. The experimental results showed that the leaching time was greatly shortened and the leaching rate of zinc was effectively improved by the assistance of ultrasound. The optimum conditions of ultrasound-assisted leaching were determined as leaching time 20 min, temperature 35'C, and the liquid/solid ratio of 5. Under these conditions, the leaching rate of zinc was close to 80% as the ultrasound power of 540W, which was increased by 7% or so, in comparison with that of conventional leaching process.

Appl. Math. Comput.,"In the present work, we introduce two equivalent concepts of uniformly rd-piecewise almost periodic functions on time scales and their equivalence is proved, based on this, some basic properties of them are obtained. Then, some new criteria of exponential dichotomy are established for homogeneous Δ-dynamic system on time scales. Also, some completely new theorems are established on time scales for impulsive almost periodic dynamic systems such as Favard's theorem and exponential dichotomy theorem. As applications, we provide a method to obtain an almost periodic solution for a given nonhomogeneous impulsive dynamic system. Furthermore, we introduce an impulsive non-autonomous Nicholson's blowflies system model with patch structure and multiple nonlinear harvesting terms for which the existence and exponential stability of almost periodic solutions are studied, which shows that our results can be applied feasibly and effectively. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The study on this model derives a planar dynamical system with two singular straight lines. On the basis of the investigation of the dynamical behavior and bifurcations of solutions of the planar dynamical system, we obtain all possible explicit exact parametric representations of solutions (including kink wave solutions, unbounded wave solutions, compactons, etc.) under different parameter conditions.

The time-varying delay term is solved via the signal replacement theory and the parameter recombination technique. For the bilinear parameterized term, a differential-difference couple-type updating law is imported. Then, convergence of the tracking error and finiteness of all signals are proved via constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii composite energy function.

Lect. Notes Electr. Eng.,"With the rapid pace of globalization, various comments and communication platforms in different languages spring up online. Correspondingly, crosslanguage sentiment analysis becomes particularly important. In this paper, we describe our experience of participation in the sixth Chinese Opinion Analysis Evaluation task 2. For the deficient training corpus of specified target language, a classified method, which gets sentiment orientation across language relied on emotional dictionary, is proposed in this paper, with aid of translation tools and training corpus in Chinese. The special way goes as follows: First, Fisher criterion is used to identify benchmark words. Considering the correlation between words, words and sentences, words and documents, as well as impacts of denied words on different sentiment words, clustering gets completed by the improved information bottleneck algorithm. Subsequently, a Chinese emotional dictionary based on sentence structure will be built. Then, calculate the sentiment weights of those translated texts by referring to negative word dictionary and degree adverb dictionary, further, the trend of texts can be identified. Evaluation results have proven that the proposed method is feasible. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,,20154101354645,,"Huang, Shu-Hui (1); Yan, Xin (1); Yu, Zheng-Tao (1); Liu, Xiao-Hui (1); Zhou, Feng (1) ","(1) School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis,136879.0,2015,"Fuzhou, China","Chinese Intelligent Automation Conference, 2015",Data mining - Natural language processing systems - Sentiment analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yan, Xin(kg_yanxin@sina.com) ",10.1007/978-3-662-46469-4_49,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),18761119,,,9783662464687.0,18761100,,2015,English,Translation (languages),Proceedings of the 2015 Chinese Intelligent Automation Conference - Intelligent Information Processing,14.0,459-467,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,,Sentiment analysis across languages based on domain-specific emotional dictionary,,Communication platforms - Degree-adverb dictionaries - Emotional dictionaries - Evaluation results - Information bottleneck - Sentence structures - Sentiment orientation analysis - Translation tools,336,

Tob. Sci. Technol.,"In order to reveal the biological function of abscisic acid (ABA) receptor genes, NtPYR1 and NtPYL9, in Nicotiana tabacum L. (N. tabacum), the encoding sequences of PYR1 and PYL9 in Arabidopsis thialianawere used as probes to find out homologous expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from N. tabacum genome in NCBI. Specific primers were designed following EST stitching, and NtPYR1 and NtPYL9 genes were cloned from cDNA library of cv. Honghuadajinyuan (N. tabacum). The open reading frames (ORFs) of NtPYRl and NtPYL9 were 678 bp and 564 bp in length and encoded proteins of 225 and 187 amino acids, respectively. Both NtPYR1 and NtPYL9 contained a conserved hydrophobic domain and belonged to PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptor gene family. The similarity between NtPYR1/NtPYL9 and their homologous proteins in Solanum lycopersicum reached 79.10%) and 95.24%, respectively. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distances between NtPYR1/NtPYL9 and their homologous genes in tomato and potato were the nearest, which indicated that PYR1 and PYL9 genes were relatively conserved in Solanaceae family. The quantitative PCR analysis of the expression patterns of NtPYR1 and NtPYL9 showed that the two could be expressed in various tissues, particularly in cotyledons and fibrous roots. The expression of NtPYR1 and NtPYL9 could be inhibited by ABA, while induced by H2O2, it implied that they might take part in the stress response process in tobacco plants. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of Tobacco Science and Technology.

Superlattices Microstruct,"We present a theoretical investigation on the terahertz (THz) absorption by long-period InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices (SLs) with inverted band structures. It is found that in such SLs the band inversion causes a significant electron-hole hybridization and a strong THz absorption can be induced by this hybridization. The THz absorption coefficient is even larger than mid-infrared absorption coefficient for short-period InAs/GaSb SLs. Moreover, we find that the strong THz absorption can be further improved and optimized by the proper choice of InAs/GaSb layer widths. The interesting absorption features are well manifested in hybridization gaps and optical transition matrix elements. This study is pertinent to the potential application of long-period inverted InAs/GaSb type-II SLs as high-efficiency THz photodetectors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol.,"BACKGROUND: Although ionic liquids (ILs) as green solvents have become a focus of research in the field of metal ions separation, little attention has been paid to gold(I) recovery from alkaline cyanide solutions using ILs as extractants. Therefore, this work explores gold(I) extraction using hydrophobic imidazolium-based ionic liquids. RESULTS: It was found that an increase in the alkyl group chain substituted on the cation ring of the ionic liquid corresponded with an increase in gold(I) extraction. Almost all of the gold(I) (>98%) was extracted from the aqueous phase into the organic phase using pure [C8mim][PF6] as an extractant. With increased reaction temperature, the gold extraction efficiency also increased. The transfer mechanism of Au(CN)2-into the ionic liquid was proved to be an anion exchange reaction. Most of the gold(I) (>90%) in the [C8mim][PF6] phase could be directly deposited on a copper cathode through electrowinning. Energy dispersive spectrometry analysis and X-ray diffraction patterns suggested that the yellow deposits on the copper cathode were pure gold. Results of three recycling experiments indicated the excellent stability of the [C8mim][PF6]. CONCLUSION: Ionic liquid extraction followed by direct electrodeposition from the organic phase is a feasible method for gold recovery from alkaline aurocyanide solutions. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.",,,20143600024415,,"Yang, Xiangjun (1); Yang, Ruisi (1); Shi, Deqiang (1); Wang, Shixiong (1); Chen, Jing (1); Guo, Hong (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",JCTBDC,"504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 531.1 Metallurgy - 539.3.1 Electroplating - 544.1 Copper - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Cathodes - Copper - Copper deposits - Cyanides - Electrodeposition - Extraction - Gold deposits - Hydrophobicity - Ion exchange - Ionic liquids - Metal ions - Metal recovery - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shixiong ",10.1002/jctb.4418,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10974660,,,,02682575,6,"June 1, 2015",English,Gold compounds,,45.0,1102-1109,,2015,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, United Kingdom",Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology,,Hydrophobic ionic liquids as novel extractants for gold(I) recovery from alkaline cyanide solutions,,Alkaline cyanide solution - Energy dispersive spectrometry - Hydrophobic ionic liquid - Imidazolium-based ionic liquid - Liquid-liquid extraction - Metal ions separation - Reaction temperature - Recycling experiments,90,
Bio-Med. Mater. Eng.,"Chitosan has been used as scaffolds with various methods of fabrication including expensive commercial available ones for tissue engineering. The objective of this study is to assemble our novel method of chitosan scaffold fabrication in economical and uncomplicated way that suitable for dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) and stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED). Chitosan scaffolds (2% and 3%) were fabricated in an uncomplicated procedure, including centrifugation and freeze-drying steps. The chitosan scaffolds were compared and the pore size, swelling and degradation were assessed. In addition, the cytocompatibility was assessed of chitosan scaffolds seeded with DPSC and SHED. The pore size of 2% and 3% chitosan scaffolds were similar being 188.71±51.90 μm and 195.30±67.21 μm, respectively. Swelling ratios of 3% chitosan scaffolds were significantly lower than those of 2% chitosan scaffolds. Dimension of scaffolds changed in first 5 minutes. After that, those scaffolds could maintain their dimension. Chitosan scaffolds degraded as from day 7. No differences were found between 2% and 3% chitosan scaffolds. The scaffolds were shown to be non-toxic and to promote DPSCs and SHED growth. The viability of DPSCs and SHED on 2% scaffolds proved to be higher than that of the 3% scaffold group. This study suggested that chitosan scaffolds fabricated with our novel method were suitable for the growth and survival of DPSC and SHED. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.",,,20150100389734,,"Guan, Zheng (1, 2); Shi, Songtao (3); Samruajbenjakun, Buncha (1); Kamolmatyakul, Suttatip (1) ","(1) Prince of Songkla University, Preventive Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Hadyai, Songkhla; 90112, Thailand (2) Biomedical Research Center, First People's Hospital of Kunming, Yunnan, China (3) University of Southern California, Center for Craniofacial Molecular Biology, Los Angeles; CA, United States ",BMENEO,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Biocompatibility - Cell culture - Chitosan - Fabrication - Pore size - Stem cells,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Kamolmatyakul, Suttatip ",10.3233/BME-141231,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),18783619,,,,09592989,,2015,English,Scaffolds (biology),,35.0,S121-S135,,2015,"IOS Press, Nieuwe Hemweg 6B, Amsterdam, 1013 BG, Netherlands",Bio-Medical Materials and Engineering,,"Fabrication, characterization and cell cultures on a novel chitosan scaffold",,Chitosan scaffold - Cytocompatibility - Deciduous teeth - Dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) - Freeze drying - Non-toxic - Swelling ratio,25,

Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng,"We conducted a detailed theoretical study on quantized acoustic-phone modes in metallic nanowile structures. Cylindrical metallic nanowire (NW) structures realized from the state-of-the-art nanotechnology, were used to demonstrate Ni NW embedded in Al2O3template. The phonon modes were examined by solving the wave equations with corresponding boundary conditions. We find that the quantized phonon energy and the energy spacing between different phonon states increase with decreasing of NW radius. The allowed phonon modes lie below the straight line of qzVAl2O3in the dispersion relation, and such a feature does not vary significantly with altering of NW radius. This study will be pertinent to the applications of metallic NW systems as high-frequency ultrasonic devices. Copyright © 2015, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.

Mater. Sci. Eng. A,"This paper describes the effects of gradient structure on mechanical properties of Cu-Zn alloys processed by surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) at liquid nitrogen temperature (77. K). This method leads to the formation of a gradient structure with surface fine-grained regions and a coarse-grained interior. In this study, a fine-grained surface layer with a thickness of 10. μm is formed on a coarse-grained Cu-Zn alloy sheet after the cryogenic SMAT process. Microstructural observations and microhardness measurements demonstrate that a significant microstructure refinement in grain size and a gradient increase in hardness from the coarse-grained core to the top surface.

Bioprocess Biosyst. Eng.,"This study aimed to improve the production of polysaccharide by engineering the biosynthetic pathway in Ganoderma lucidum through the overexpression of α-phosphoglucomutase (PGM) gene. PGM is responsible for the linkage between sugar catabolism and sugar anabolism. The effects of PGM gene overexpression on intracellular polysaccharide (IPS) content, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production and transcription levels of three genes encoding the enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, including PGM, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP), and β-1,3-glucan synthase (GLS), were investigated. The maximum IPS content and EPS production in G. lucidum overexpressing the PGM gene were 23.67 mg/100 mg dry weight and 1.76 g/L, respectively, which were higher by 40.5 and 44.3 % than those of the wild-type strain. The transcription levels of PGM, UGP and GLS were upregulated by 4.77-, 1.51- and 1.53-fold, respectively, in the engineered strain, suggesting that increased polysaccharide biosynthesis may result from a higher expression of those genes. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20153101087450,,"Xu, Jun-Wei (2); Ji, Sen-Lin (2); Li, Huan-Jun (2); Zhou, Jiang-Sheng (2); Duan, Yan-Qing (3); Dang, Li-Zhi (3); Mo, Ming-He (1) ","(1) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-resources, Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources of the Ministry of Education, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (3) Hongyun Honghe Tobacco (Group) Co.

Water Resour. Manage.,"Medium range daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasts are very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators for improving their irrigation scheduling. We tested four artificial neural networks (ANNs) for EToforecasting using forecasted temperatures data retrieved from public weather forecasts. Daily meteorological data were collected to train and validate the ANNs against the Penman–Monteith (PM) model. And then, the temperature forecasts for 7-day ahead were entered into the validated ANNs to produce EToforecast outputs. The forecasting performances of models were evaluated through comparisons between the EToforecasted by ANNs and ETocalculated by PM from the observed meteorological data. The correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted temperatures for all stations were all greater than 0.91, and the accuracy of the minimum temperature forecast (error within ± 2 °C) ranged from 68.34 to 91.61%, whereas for the maximum temperature it ranged from 51.78 to 57.44%. The accuracy of the EToforecast (error within ± 1.5 mm day-1) ranged from 75.53 to 78.14%, the average values of the mean absolute error ranged from 0.99 to 1.09 mm day-1, the average values of the root mean square error ranged from 0.87 to 1.36 mm day-1, and the average values of the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.70 to 0.75. The results suggested that ANNs can be considered as a promising EToforecasting tool. The forecasting performance can be improved by promoting temperature forecast accuracy. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",,,20152801018254,A024,"Luo, Yufeng (1, 2, 3); Traore, Seydou (2); Lyu, Xinwei (4); Wang, Weiguang (3); Wang, Ying (5); Xie, Yongyu (3); Jiao, Xiyun (3); Fipps, Guy (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan; Hubei; 430072, China (2) Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station; TX; 77843, United States (3) State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing; Jiangsu; 210098, China (4) School of Software Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; Anhui; 230026, China (5) Department of Water Conservancy, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming; Yunan; 650201, China ",,443 Meteorology - 821.3 Agricultural Methods - 912.2 Management - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Errors - Evapotranspiration - Irrigation - Mean square error - Meteorology - Neural networks - Scheduling,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Luo, Yufeng(yufeng.luo@gmail.com) ",10.1007/s11269-015-1033-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15731650,,,,09204741,10,2015,English,Weather forecasting,,31.0,3863-3876,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Water Resources Management,,Medium range daily reference evapotranspiration forecasting by using ann and public weather forecasts,,Correlation coefficient - Forecasting performance - Irrigation scheduling - Maximum temperature - Minimum temperatures - Reference evapotranspiration - Root mean square errors - Temperature forecasts,29,

Astropart. Phys.,"The boiling of possible quark nuggets during the quark-hadron phase transition of the Universe at nonzero chemical potential is revisited within the microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach employed for the hadron phase, using two kinds of baryon interactions as fundamental inputs. To describe the deconfined phase of quark matter, we use a recently developed quark mass density-dependent model with a fully self-consistent thermodynamic treatment of confinement. We study the baryon number limitAboil(above which boiling may be important) with three typical values for the confinement parameter D. It is firstly found that the baryon interaction with a softer equation of state for the hadron phase would only lead to a small increase ofAboil. However, results depend sensitively on the confinement parameter in the quark model. Specifically, boiling might be important during the Universe cooling for a limited parameter range around D1/2=170 MeV, a value satisfying recent lattice QCD calculations of the vacuum chiral condensate, while for other choices of this parameter, boiling might not happen and cosmological quark nuggets of 10250could survive. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20144500156825,,"Li, Ang (1, 2); Liu, Tong (1, 2, 3); Gubler, Philipp (4); Xu, Ren-Xin (5) ","(1) Department of Astronomy, Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, Xiamen University, Xiamen; 361005, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Theoretical Physics, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100190, China (3) Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan; 650011, China (4) RIKEN Nishina Center, RIKEN, Wako; 351-0198, Japan (5) School of Physics, State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Physics and Technology, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China ",APHYEE,801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics,,,,,Chemical potential - Equations of state - Hadrons - Quantum theory - Stereochemistry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Ang ",10.1016/j.astropartphys.2014.08.001,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2012CB821800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014CB845800, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: OP201305, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 11225314, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11233006, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1331101, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1431107, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11103015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11078015, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11473022, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Two of us (AL, TL) would like to thank Dr. H.

Catal. Commun.,"An effective approach of simultaneous coordinating etching and Pd nano coating technology is employed to prepare hollow Pd/CeO2nanocubes as catalysts for the lowerature oxidation of CO. The activities of Pd/CeO2catalysts are higher than that of Pd supported on Al2O3, and the activity of 1 wt.% Pd/CeO2can be enhanced obviously and its T90(which denotes the temperatures at which a 90% conversion of the initial reactants is attained) is as low as - 5.6 °C. The intrinsic hollow nature as well as high porosity of the unique nanostructures of CeO2support contributes greatly to the formation of large numbers of surface oxygen vacancies on the as-prepared Pd/CeO2catalysts, and therefore it exhibits outstanding catalytic activity. This strategy method is simple, of low cost, which may shed light on a new avenue for fast synthesis of hollow cube-like nano functional materials for catalyst, drug delivery, energy storage and other new applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Principal components analysis (PCA) showed the first PCA axis (corresponding to degraded litter quantity and quality) explained 61.3% and 71.2% of variation in DOC and DN concentrations, respectively. Stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that litter carbon mass controlled DOC and hemicellulose mass controlled DN concentrations.

Space Sci Rev,"We introduce how the catastrophe model for solar eruptions predicted the formation and development of the long current sheet (CS) and how the observations were used to recognize the CS at the place where the CS is presumably located. Then, we discuss the direct measurement of the CS region thickness by studying the brightness distribution of the CS region at different wavelengths. The thickness ranges from 104km$10^{4}~\mbox{km}$ to about 105km$10^{5}~\mbox{km}$ at heights between 0.27 and 1.16Ro$1.16~\mathrm{R}_{\odot}$ from the solar surface. But the traditional theory indicates that the CS is as thin as the proton Larmor radius, which is of order tens of meters in the corona. We look into the huge difference in the thickness between observations and theoretical expectations. The possible impacts that affect measurements and results are studied, and physical causes leading to a thick CS region in which reconnection can still occur at a reasonably fast rate are analyzed. Studies in both theories and observations suggest that the difference between the true value and the apparent value of the CS thickness is not significant as long as the CS could be recognised in observations. We review observations that show complex structures and flows inside the CS region and present recent numerical modelling results on some aspects of these structures. Both observations and numerical experiments indicate that the downward reconnection outflows are usually slower than the upward ones in the same eruptive event. Numerical simulations show that the complex structure inside CS and its temporal behavior as a result of turbulence and the Petschek-type slow-mode shock could probably account for the thick CS and fast reconnection. But whether the CS itself is that thick still remains unknown since, for the time being, we cannot measure the electric current directly in that region. We also review the most recent laboratory experiments of reconnection driven by energetic laser beams, and discuss some important topics for future works. © 2015, The Author(s).",,Open Access,20154401471694,,"Lin, Jun (1); Murphy, Nicholas A.

"CICTP - Effic., Safe, Green Multimodal Transp. - Proc. COTA Int. Conf. Transp. Prof.","Aimed at the problems of elderly travel behavior research in China, a structural equation model was built based from 407 elderly travel questionnaire surveys and 54 follow-up interviews in Kunming in September 2013. The model considers the personal and family attributes of the sample as the exogenous latent variables, and trip purpose, departure time, trip mode, and travel intensity as the endogenous latent variables. The relevance between the attributes and travel behavior and the relevance among the travel behavior parameters are analyzed through modeling and calculating the relationship among elderly travel behavior characteristic parameters. We concluded that the differences in personal attributes and in family attributes produce no significant impact on the travel behavior of the urban elderly. Also, elderly travel behavior is closely related to their activity characteristics, the activities that have an effect on travel mode, and travel intensity. Finally, there is a significant correlation among urban elderly travel behavior characteristic variables, and the relevance also existed between departure time and travel mode as well as travel mode and travel intensity. © ASCE.",,,20160201777631,,"Dong, Ren (1); Han, Gang (1); Li, Lin (1); Han, Wen (1) ","(1) Faculty of Transportation Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",,432 Highway Transportation - 433 Railroad Transportation - 971 Social Sciences,117391.0,"July 24, 2015 - July 27, 2015","Beijing, China","15th COTA International Conference of Transportation Professionals: Efficient, Safe, and Green Multimodal Transportation, CICTP 2015",Multimodal transportation - Surveys,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1061/9780784479292.253,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9780784479292.0,,,2015,English,Behavioral research,"CICTP 2015 - Efficient, Safe, and Green Multimodal Transportation - Proceedings of the 15th COTA International Conference of Transportation Professionals",17.0,2753-2765,1of1,2015,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),"CICTP 2015 - Efficient, Safe, and Green Multimodal Transportation - Proceedings of the 15th COTA International Conference of Transportation Professionals",Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE); Transportation and Development Institute (T and DI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE); Transportation Research Board,Study Based on the Structural Equation Model on the Relevance of Urban Elderly Travel Behavior Characteristics: A Case Study of Kunming,,Elderly travels - Latent variable - Personal attributes - Questionnaire surveys - Relevance - Structural equation modeling - Travel behaviors - Urban elderly,,
Opt Commun,"Abstract A mode converter between LP01and LP0mmodes is proposed using two stages of tapers. The first stage is formed by an adiabatically tapering a circular fiber to excite the desirable LP0mmode. The second stage is formed by inserting an inner core (tapered from both sides) with a refractive index smaller than the original core. This second stage is used to obtain low insertion loss and high extinction ratio of the desired LP0mmode. Three converters between LP01and LP0m, m=2, 3, and 4, are designed for C-band, and simulation results show that less than 0.24, 0.54 and 0.7 dB insertion loss and higher than 15, 16, and 17.5 dB extinction ratio over the entire band were obtained for the three converters, respectively. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20152801020803,20203,"Mellah, Hakim (1); Zhang, Xiupu (1, 2); Shen, Dongya (2) ","(1) iPhotonics Laboratories, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal; Quebec; H3G 1M8, Canada (2) iCom Laboratories, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",OPCOB8,"717.1 Optical Communication Systems - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices",,,,,Fiber optics - Fibers - Insertion losses - Light extinction - Optical devices - Refractive index - Space division multiple access,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Xiupu(xzhang@ece.concordia.ca) ",10.1016/j.optcom.2015.05.066,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,00304018,,"July 10, 2015",English,Optical fiber communication,,33.0,148-153,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Optics Communications,,LP01to LP0mmode converters using all-fiber two-stage tapers,,Extinction ratios - Fiber optics and optical communications - Fiber optics components - High extinction ratios - Low insertion loss - Mode converter - Mode-division multiplexing - Space division multiplexing,354,

Under excitation at 980 nm, bright green UC emission centered at 550 nm accompanied with weak red (663 nm) and near infrared (NIR) UC emissions (760 nm) were observed. Power dependence studies revealed that NIR and red UC emissions were both dominated by a two and one-photon process due to saturation effects that is related to the special crystal structure of BiOBr nanosheets, and a different UC mechanism of NIR emission from Ho3+was proposed accordingly. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20152200898695,13721,"Li, Yongjin (1, 2); Song, Zhiguo (1); Yin, Zhaoyi (1); Kuang, Qingliang (1); Wan, Ronghua (1); Zhou, Yuting (1); Liu, Qun (1); Qiu, Jianbei (1); Yang, Zhengwen (1) ","(1) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Department of Science Research, Yunnan Technology and Business University, Kunming; 651700, China ",SAMCAS,741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 933 Solid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice,,,,,Atomic force microscopy - Bromine compounds - Crystal structure - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Holmium compounds - Infrared devices - Light absorption - Luminescence - Nanosheets - Transmission electron microscopy - Uranium compounds - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Zhiguo ",10.1016/j.saa.2015.05.053,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,13861425,,"May 31, 2015",English,Bismuth compounds,,30.0,135-141,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy,,Investigation on the upconversion emission in 2D BiOBr:Yb3+/Ho3+nanosheets,,BiOBr:Yb^3+/Ho^3+ - Fourier transform infrared absorption - Hydrothermal methods - Luminescence spectrum - Nanostructure material - Two Dimensional (2 D) - Up-conversion - Up-conversion emission,150,

The target-oriented researches on the Vanadium-containing weathering steels were conducted in this paper in order to combine with the advantage of vanadium resource at Panzhihua Iron & steel (group) Co... A Glbeele-3500 thermal simulator was used to investigate the effect of the deformation amount and the nitrogen content on the precipitation -temperature-time (PTT) curves of the vanadium-containing weathering steel and relationship between the nitrogen content or the deformation amount, temperature and precipitation time was analyzed. It has been found that the PTT curves of test samples are C curve shape. The temperature corresponding to the shortest time of precipitation is also found. Increasing the nitrogen content will make PTT curve move to the left significantly. Additionally, increasing deformation amount can also accelerate the precipitation rate of V (C, N) in the austenite and makes PTT curve move to the left obviously. It has also been found that the more the deformation amount, the shorter the start time of the V (C, N) precipitation.

Diangong Jishu Xuebao,"In the case of lightning striking towers or lines without causing fault, the response of transmission line contains characteristic of lightning current without the characteristic of fault. However, when the fault occurs, there is characteristic of fault current impulse. CVT and CT transfer functions are put forward based on the voltage transfer characteristics and current transfer characteristics. It is found that the oscillation caused by the transfer function of CVT in the simulation includes oscillation caused by poles of transfer function and the numerical oscillation. The CVT secondary voltage and the CT secondary current are used to calculate the instantaneous power, which is selected as the characteristic vector in this paper. The instantaneous power curve clusters formed by different fault types and lightning disturbance are transformed to principle component analysis (PCA) axis via PCA. The bulks of traveling wave data form lightning disturbance cluster center and the fault cluster center. SVM is chosen to determine lightning disturbance from faults.

Adv. Energ. Sci. Equip. Eng. - Proc. Int. Conf. Energ. Equip. Sci. Eng.,"Leaf area is an important parameter for the physiological processes of trees. The single young and mature leaf area and perimeter estimation models of eucalyptus were developed based on leaf dry weight. Leaf area and leaf weight were measured from 229 fresh leaves of 20 trees of eucalyptus in southwest China. Based on the functional structural model and mixed-effect models with plots and saplings as random effects, using Akaike’s Information Criterion to assess the appropriateness of the models, we found the power models could best describe the relationship between the leaf area and weight for young and mature leaf. The study provides a simple and reliable method for estimating single-leaf area, which has a good potential in the functional-structural model of eucalyptus. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20160902044444,,"Cheng, Xi Ping (1); Wang, Yan Fang (1); Ma, Yue Wei (1) ","(1) Southwest Forestry University, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,922.1 Probability Theory,,,,,Forestry - Random processes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781138029330.0,,,2015,English,Physiological models,"Advances in Energy Science and Equipment Engineering - Proceedings of International Conference on Energy Equipment Science and Engineering, ICEESE 2015",11.0,51-54,1 of 1,2015,CRC Press/Balkema,"Advances in Energy Science and Equipment Engineering - Proceedings of International Conference on Energy Equipment Science and Engineering, ICEESE 2015",,Single leaf-level measurement and estimation of eucalyptus based on functional-structural model,,Estimation models - Functional-structural models - Information criterion - Mixed-effect models - Physiological process - Random effects - Reliable methods - Southwest China,1,

According to the principle of gross error elimination method, a kind of low-voltage power line impedance measurement method was designed. In red-walled area, a typical rural-urban continuum of Yunnan, low-pressure collecting station, has been measured. During the analysis of time domain and frequency domain at 80–500 kHz interval data, we have arrived at the conclusion that the low-voltage power line network has weak sensibility.

Annealing at 250. °C for 120. min produced higher strength, which is attributed to the formation of nanoscale annealing twins.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Community detection is a very important task in social network analysis. Most existing community detection algorithms are designed for singlerelational networks. However, in the real world, social networks are mostly multi-relational. In this paper, we propose a coalition formation game theorybased approach to detect communities in multi-relational social networks. We define the multi-relational communities as the shared communities over multiple single-relational graphs, and model community detection as a coalition formation game process in which actors in a social network are modeled as rational players trying to improve group’s utilities by cooperating with other players to form coalitions. Each player is allowed to join multiple coalitions and coalitions with fewer players can merge into a larger coalition as long as the merge operation could improve the utilities of coalitions merged. We then use a greedy agglomerative manner to identify communities. Experimental results and performance studies verify the effectiveness of our approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,20153001059362,,"Zhou, Lihua (1); Yang, Peizhong (1); Lü, Kevin (2); Zhang, Zidong (1); Chen, Hongmei (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Brunel University, Uxbridge; UB8 3PH, United Kingdom ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.1 Probability Theory - 971 Social Sciences",119659.0,"June 8, 2015 - June 10, 2015","Qingdao, China","16th International Conference on Web-Age Information Management, WAIM 2015",Game theory - Information management - Mergers and acquisitions - Population dynamics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Lihua(lhzhou@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_3,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319210414.0,03029743,,2015,English,Social networking (online),,32.0,30-41,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Inspur; SAP,A coalition formation game theory-based approach for detecting communities in multi-relational networks,,Coalition formation games - Community detection - Community detection algorithms - Model communities - Multi-relational networks - Performance study - Rational players - Relational graph,9098,"Web-Age Information Management - 16th International Conference, WAIM 2015, Proceedings"
Guangxue Xuebao,"Tip-tilt disturbance of atmospheric turbulence leads to the angle-of-arrival fluctuations when a beam is propagating through such an atmosphere. The laser beam is propagating through the turbulent atmosphere twice in the cases of satellite laser ranging and laser guide star. Different locations of geometric layouts of laser transceiver lead to the difference in correlation of tip-tilt fluctuations between laser launch and receive paths, and affect the variations of angle-of-arrival fluctuations in the end. Based on the geometry of laser transceiver, the tip-tilt correlation between two separated apertures is developed by using the wavefront expansion on the Zernike polynomials. The changes of the tip-tilt correlation due to the geometrical limit of common optical path system and non-common optical path system are analyzed. Finally, the impacts of geometric layouts of the different laser transceivers on the angle-of-arrival fluctuations are discussed. ©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

Taiyangneng Xuebao,"Dynamic models for each component of PV refrigerator system which consisted of PV module, controller, storage battery, inverter and refrigerator were developed. The flow diagram of PV refrigerator model was set up with Visio software according to the logical relationship of parameters. Finally, a simulation model for predicting the performance of a PV refrigerator system under different weather conditions was set up, too. In order to validate the developed simulation model, an experimental system was set up and tested under variable climatic conditions in Kunming region. Good agreement was achieved between computational model and experimental test. Further research on the influence of variable conditions on the performance of PV refrigerator was conducted. The results show that the performance of PV module is mainly effected by solar radiation intensity and ambient temperature. The output current of PV module is positively correlated with solar radiation intensity and negatively correlated with ambient temperature. Finally, the feasibility of AC PV refrigerator system from economy aspect was discussed and the methods to reduce cost were proposed. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Clim. Change,"To investigate climate variability in Asia during the last millennium, the spatial and temporal evolution of summer (June–July–August; JJA) temperature in eastern and south-central Asia is reconstructed using multi-proxy records and the regularized expectation maximization (RegEM) algorithm with truncated total least squares (TTLS), under a point-by-point regression (PPR) framework. The temperature index reconstructions show that the late 20th century was the warmest period in Asia over the past millennium. The temperature field reconstructions illustrate that temperatures in central, eastern, and southern China during the 11th and 13th centuries, and in western Asia during the 12th century, were significantly higher than those in other regions, and comparable to levels in the 20th century. Except for the most recent warming, all identified warm events showed distinct regional expressions and none were uniform over the entire reconstruction area. The main finding of the study is that spatial temperature patterns have, on centennial time-scales, varied greatly over the last millennium. Moreover, seven climate model simulations, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), over the same region of Asia, are all consistent with the temperature index reconstruction at the 99 % confidence level. Only spatial temperature patterns extracted as the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) from the GISS-E2-R and MPI-ESM-P model simulations are significant and consistent with the temperature field reconstruction over the past millennium in Asia at the 90 % confidence level. This indicates that both the reconstruction and the simulations depict the temporal climate variability well over the past millennium. However, the spatial simulation or reconstruction capability of climate variability over the past millennium could be still limited. For reconstruction, some grid points do not pass validation tests and reveal the need for more proxies with high temporal resolution, accurate dating, and sensitive temperature signals, especially in central Asia and before AD 1400. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,20152000842277,,"Shi, Feng (1); Ge, Quansheng (2); Yang, Bao (3); Li, Jianping (4, 5); Yang, Fengmei (6); Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier (7, 8); Solomina, Olga (9, 10); Nakatsuka, Takeshi (11); Wang, Ninglian (3); Zhao, Sen (12); Xu, Chenxi (11); Fang, Keyan (13); Sano, Masaki (11); Chu, Guoqiang (1); Fan, Zexin (14); Gaire, Narayan P.

Carpathian J. Sci. Technol. Food,"To investigate the benefits of alternate partial root-zone irrigation (AI) on fruit yield and quality of tomato modified by water and nitrogen (N) management, taking conventional irrigation (CI) as the control, the effects of AI at different water levels and growth stages, i.e. AI1(high water (W1) from the blooming to fruiting stages), AI2(W1at the blooming to fruit setting stage (BFS) and low water (W2) at the fruiting stage (FS)), AI3(W2at BFS and W1at FS) and AI4(W2from the blooming to fruiting stages), on fruit yield and quality and WUE of tomato were studied under the three N levels, i.e. low N (NL), middle N (NM) and high N (NH). Irrigation quota for W1 and W2 in AI at BFS or FS was 80% and 60% of that in CI, respectively. AI increased tomato soluble solids content in fruits, but reduced organic acids content compared with CI. AI at NLand NMincreased WUE by 7.4%-24.4%, and AI1did not reduce fruit yield significantly. Compared to NL, NMincreased fruit yield, WUE and the contents of soluble solids, soluble sugars, lycopene and organic acids. Compared to CINLtreatment, AI1NMtreatment increased fruit yield, WUE and the contents of soluble sugars, lycopene, vitamin C and sugar/acid ratio, respectively. Thus AI under high water from the blooming to fruiting stages can guarantee fruit yield and improve fruit quality and WUE under middle nitrogen level.

Int. J. Mater. Res.,"Large-area and oriented silicon nanowire arrays have been successfully fabricated through a two-step metal-assisted chemical etching process at room temperature. The effects of key fabrication parameters (AgNO3concentration, Fe(NO3)3concentration, and etching time) on the silicon nanowire nanostructure were carefully investigated. The Raman spectra of silicon nanowires prepared under different etching times have been recorded and analyzed. The porosity and length of the nanowire increases with the increase in AgNO3concentration from 0.002 mol L-1to 0.1 mol L-1, which indicates that the re-dissolved Ag+ions would work as the main oxidative species and catalyze the vertical and lateral etching of nanowires, leading to silicon nanowire growth and porous structure formation. © Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH & Co.

J. Inf. Comput. Sci.,"An Asymmetric Trip Ranging (ATR) protocol is proposed for TOA-based wireless localization. The TOA-based localization model is represented as linear estimation problem by using ATR protocol. The proposed Weighted Least Square (WLS) algorithm provides an algebraic solution to the source location. Then the Constrained Weighted Least Square (CWLS) algorithm is designed to improve the localization result by availing the relationship of the estimate. The WLS and CWLS algorithms represent the source location as algebraic form which does not require the initial solution. The simulations show that the performance of the proposed algorithms provide accurate source location estimation for TOA-based wireless localization. Compared with the WLS algorithm, the positioning error of CWLS algorithm is reduced. The performance of the CWLS algorithm is more close to the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) than that of the WLS algorithm. © 2015 by Binary Information Press.",,,20155101706839,,"Shen, Shikai (1, 2); She, Yumei (3); Qian, Kaiguo (2); Wang, Wu (2) ","(1) School of Systems Information Science, Future University Hakodate, Hakodate, Japan (2) School of Information and Technology, Kunming University, Kunming, China (3) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921.1 Algebra,,,,,Algebra - Algorithms - Location,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shen, Shikai(kmssk2000@sina.com) ",10.12733/jics20106904,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,15487741,17,"November 20, 2015",English,Time of arrival,,10.0,6545-6552,,2015,Binary Information Press,Journal of Information and Computational Science,,Algebraic solution for source localization by using TOA-based asymmetric trip ranging,,Algebraic solution - Constrained weighted least-squares - Linear estimation - Localization modeling - Positioning error - Source localization - Weighted least squares - Wireless localization,12,
Acta Geophys. Sin.,"The convergence between the Indian plate and the Eurasian plates has resulted in the shortening of crust at least 1500 km and thickening of crust to twice of the normal (about 70 km) beneath the collision zone over the last 45 Ma. To model the mechanism of the surface deformation, several models, including lateral extrusion of rigid blocks along large strike-slip faults and lower crust flow have been proposed. The crustal-flow model, in which the middle/lower crust in central Tibet is partially molten and flows from central Tibet through Sichuan into Yunnan, is gradually accepted by seismologists. Therefore, the study of the deformational characteristics in crust and mantle and the geodynamic model beneath Sichuan and Yunnan (southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau) remains one of focused issues in the earth sciences of the world for many years. Although the fine crustal structures have been obtained in the region during the past several decades, the mechanisms for plateau deformation and expansion are still enigmatic due to the resolution limitations of methods and/or data. The aim of this paper is to select the previous results, analyze their discrepancies and conclude the reliable evidence for the lower crustal-flow model. The lower crustal flow model on the evolution of the Tibetan plateau yields surface velocity and deformation field consistent with observations of GPS, thus being very popular in the earth science community. A scientific problem in deep geophysics is searching for evidence on the existence of the lower crustal flow. In this paper, GPS observations, focal mechanism solutions, and Pms phase splitting in Sichuan and Yunnan are combined to explore the reasonability of crustal deformation models. On the other hand, based on the analysis of tomography, receiver function inversion, and magnetotelluric profiles, this paper discusses whether there exits the deep evidence on lower crustal flow beneath Sichuan and Yunnan, as well as the distribution scale of lower crustal flow if it is really present. The geodynamic implications are also investigated in relation to surface geological features, GPS velocities, Pms phase splitting, and focal mechanism. We observe a conspicuous sharper clockwise rotation around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, and suggest that the deformation between the upper and lower crust within Sichuan and Yunnan is coupled. Resistivity imaging by magnetotelluric measurements have mapped two zones of high electrical conductivity at depth 20~40 km beneath southeast Tibet, only along the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault and Jiali-Nujiang fault, respectively. However, the crustal velocity structure obtained by inversion of receiver functions and surface waves shows that intra-crust low-velocity zone (IC-LVZ) is locally distributed in western Sichuan, and not found in the Sichuan basin. Additionally, by analysis of the polarity of the converted phases at intra-crust interfaces, we suggest that a wide-spread IC-LVZ is present in Yunnan. According to the distribution features of the negative polarity at intra-crust interface and crustal structure from joint inversion of receiver functions of surface waves, it is concluded that an IC-LVZ from eastern Tibet on a large scale may exist beneath Sichuan and Yunnan, and has reached the southern Yunnan, but has a complex geometric shape. In Yunnan, this zone appears to be constrained in a certain area by the Xiaojiang and Jinshajiang-Red River faults. This conclusion is not quite consistent with previous suggestion that the lower-crustal flow reaches only the Lijiang-Jinhe fault, and that the lower crustal flow is only bounded within two arc-like channels. © 2015, Science Press.

Geotecton. Metallog.,"There are at least four episodes of magmatism in the southern segment of the Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO) in the Late Archean and early Paleoproterozoic (2.85-2.72 Ga, 2.57-2.48 Ga, 2.34-2.30 Ga, 2.20-2.07 Ga) based on the zircon U-Pb geochronology of the Taihua and Dengfeng Complexes. The early Neoarchean magmatism in the Southern Segment of the TNCO predates that in the Central and Northern Segments of the TNCO. Additionally, the early Paleoproterozoic magmatism in the Southern Segment (2.34-2.30 Ga) is much stronger than that in the Central and North Segments. TTG rocks of the first episode (2.85-2.72 Ga) have overall positive ΕHf(t) and ΕNd(t) values, and show weak Hf-Nd isotope decoupling above the Terrestrial Hf-Nd Array, indicative of a genetic relationship with metasomatism mantle. TTG rocks at the end of Neoarchean and the beginning of Paleoproterozoic (2.57-2.48 Ga) have mostly positive ΕHf(t) and ΕNd(t) values. Some samples show weak Hf-Nd isotope decoupling under the Terrestrial Hf-Nd Array, which is attributed to zircon effect. So the protolith of the gneisses is proposed to be the result of partial melting of dominantly juvenile crust with minor ancient continental crust. TTG rocks or the potassium-rich igneous in the early and middle Paleoproterozoic (2.34-2.30 Ga and 2.20-2.07 Ga, respectively) have all negative ΕHf(t) and ΕNd(t) values, and show notable Hf-Nd isotope decoupling under the Terrestrial Hf-Nd Array due to zircon effect. The last two episodes of magmatism were derived from partial melting of dominantly ancient continental crustal materials. Therefore, the Hf-Nd isotope decoupling of the gneisses in the Taihua and Dengfeng Complexes might have been inherited from their source related to the mantle metamorphism or zircon effect rather than produced by garnet effect. This suggests that the geochemical characteristics, such as high Sr/Y and (La/Yb)Nratios and low concentrations of heavy REE in the TTG rocks, could not have been inherited from their sources, but are attributed to magmatism under high-pressure condition. In conclusion, the earlier two episodes of magmatism (early Neoarchean and the end of Neoarchean to beginning of Paleoproterozoic, respectively) recorded two main episodic crustal growth, while the later two episodes of magmatism (early and middle early Paleoproterozoic, respectively) were attributed to crustal reworking. © 2015, Science Press.

J. Chromatogr. A,"Solvent system selection is the first step toward a successful counter-current chromatography (CCC) separation. This paper introduces a systematic and practical solvent system selection strategy based on the nonrandom two-liquid segment activity coefficient (NRTL-SAC) model, which is efficient in predicting the solute partition coefficient. Firstly, the application of the NRTL-SAC method was extended to the ethyl acetate/. n-butanol/water and chloroform/methanol/water solvent system families. Moreover, the versatility and predictive capability of the NRTL-SAC method were investigated. The results indicate that the solute molecular parameters identified from hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water solvent system family are capable of predicting a large number of partition coefficients in several other different solvent system families. The NRTL-SAC strategy was further validated by successfully separating five components from Salvia plebeian R.Br. We therefore propose that NRTL-SAC is a promising high throughput method for rapid solvent system selection and highly adaptable to screen suitable solvent system for real-life CCC separation. © 2015.",,,20151300679436,,"Ren, Da-Bing (1, 2); Yi, Lun-Zhao (1, 2); Qin, Yan-Hua (2); Yun, Yong-Huan (2); Deng, Bai-Chuan (2, 3); Lu, Hong-Mei (2); Chen, Xiao-Qing (2); Liang, Yi-Zeng (2) ","(1) Yunnan Food Safety Research Institute, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (3) Department of Chemistry, University of Bergen, Bergen; N-5007, Norway ",JCRAEY,802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals,,,,,Chlorine compounds - Drug products - Liquid chromatography - Phase equilibria - Separation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yi, Lun-Zhao(ylz7910@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.chroma.2015.03.016,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18733778,"Number: 21075138, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21275164, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21465016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21375151, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011TT1007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is financially supported by Research and Innovative Condition Project of Hunan Province ( 2011TT1007 ), and the National Nature Foundation Committee of P.R.

Food Chem.,"The antibacterial activities and mechanism of a new P7 were investigated in this study. P7 showed antimicrobial activities against five harmful microorganisms which contaminate and spoil food (MIC = 4-32 μM). Flow cytometry and scanning electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that P7 induced pore-formation on the cell surface and led to morphological changes but did not lyse cell. Confocal fluorescence microscopic observations and flow cytometry analysis expressed that P7 could penetrate the Escherichia coli cell membrane and accumulate in the cytoplasm. Moreover, P7 possessed a strong DNA binding affinity. Further cell cycle analysis and change in gene expression analysis suggested that P7 induced a decreased expression in the genes involved in DNA replication. Up-regulated expression genes encoding DNA damage repair. This study suggests that P7 could be applied as a candidate for the development of new food preservatives as it exerts its antibacterial activities by penetrating cell membranes and targets intracellular DNA. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J. Biosci. Bioeng.,"The 1389-bp thcel5A gene, which encodes a family 5 of glycoside hydrolases (GH5), was screened from the draft genome of Thermobifida halotolerans YIM 90462T. ThCel5A was most similar (77% identity) to a GH5 endoglucanase from Thermobifida fusca YX, followed by cellulases from Nocardiopsis dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111, Nocardiopsis alba ATCC BAA-2165, and Kribbella flavida DSM 17836. The deduced amino acid sequence of ThCel5A, which consisted of 462 amino acid residues, encompassed a family 2 cellulose-binding module and a GH5 catalytic domain. Notably, ThCel5A hydrolysed soluble as well as insoluble cellulose substrates. The enzymatic hydrolysis assay showed that the activity of recombinant ThCel5A was optimized at pH 8.0 and 50°C. Moreover, it retained hydrolytic activity in the presence of various metal ions and >90% activity within the range of pH 8.0-9.0 after 30 min at 50°C. These results suggested that this enzyme has considerable potential in industrial applications. © 2015 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.",,,20152200891410,,"Zhang, Feng (2); Zhang, Xiao-Mei (3); Yin, Yi-Rui (3); Li, Wen-Jun (1, 3) ","(1) College of Ecology and Evolution, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China (2) School of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou; 350002, China (3) Key Laboratory of Microbial Diversity in Southwest China, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Institute of Microbiology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",JBBIF6,"461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 531.1 Metallurgy - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.3 Cellulose, Lignin and Derivatives",,,,,Amino acids - Cellulose - Genes - Hydrolases - Industrial applications - Metal ions - Metals,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Wen-Jun(liwenjun3@mail.sysu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.04.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),13474421,"Number: 2013FA004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013DFA31980, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology; Number: 2010CB833801, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This research was also supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2010CB833801 ), the Key Project of International Cooperation of China Ministry of Science & Technology (MOST) (No. 2013DFA31980 ) and the Key Project of Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation ( 2013FA004 ).

ICEIEC - Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Electron. Inf. Emerg. Commun.,"To achieve good performance on Protein sub-nuclear location, one needs to extract a powerful representation containing rich information for identification. Various favorable techniques have been proposed, but it is believed that the single representations, containing one-sided information of protein sequence, are insufficient for discrimination. To this end, we in this paper propose the fused representations by integrating two single representations, the amino acid composition (AAC) and the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM). Due to two forms of PSSM, PsePSSM and GreyPSSM, two integrated representations, called briefly AACPsePSSM and AACGreyPSSM, are given. To evaluate the proposed representations, a benchmark data set is employed and the classical K nearest neighbor (KNN) is adopted classifier. And the experimental results show our proposed fusion representations outperform AAC and PSSM. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20160801976346,7284529.0,"Liu, Shuhui (1); Wang, Shunfang (1); Ding, Haiyan (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.5 Optimization Techniques,117890.0,"May 14, 2015 - May 16, 2015","Beijing, China","5th IEEE International Conference on Electronics Information and Emergency Communication, ICEIEC 2015",Location - Nearest neighbor search - Proteins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shunfang(wangsf_66@hotmail.com) ",10.1109/ICEIEC.2015.7284529,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479972838.0,,,"September 29, 2015",English,Classification (of information),ICEIEC 2015 - Proceedings of 2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Electronics Information and Emergency Communication,9.0,236-239,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,ICEIEC 2015 - Proceedings of 2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Electronics Information and Emergency Communication,IEEE Hong Kong Computational Intelligence Society,Protein sub-nuclear location by fusing AAC and PSSM features based on sequence information,,AACGreyPSSM - AACPsePSSM - Amino acid compositions - Features fusions - Integrated representations - K nearest neighbor (KNN) - Position specific scoring matrix - Sequence informations,,

The proposed method can divided into two steps to reconstruct ROI of an object from a set of its noisy projection lines that passed through ROI.

In order to improve system efficiency, two-stage gas cooler, dual capillary tube combination throttle and internal heat exchanger were used in the CO2heat pump hot water system. The effects of climatic and operational parameters on the steady state thermal performance of the CO2heat pump hot water system were tested and analyzed in the constant temperature environmental chamber. Test results under typical climate conditions showed that system performance was excellent. The CO2heat pump hot water system could provide 60-85 hot water according to climatic conditions, and its daily COP (coefficient of performance) was about 3.45-4.04 under the climatic conditions of ambient temperature at 4.1 to 27.3. ©All Right Reserved",,,20152801011316,,"Luo, Huilong (1); Lin, Bianqi (1); Du, Peijian (2); Yang, Xiaochuan (2); Ma, Ruifang (1); Xiang, Kaigen (1) ","(1) School of Civil Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Kunming Dongqi Corporation of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650106, China ",HUKHAI,616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and Components - 618.1 Compressors - 618.2 Pumps - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Compressors - Environmental chambers - Heat pump systems - Hot water distribution systems - Measurement - Pumps - Water,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Luo, Huilong(huilongluo@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.11949/j.issn.0438-1157.20150049,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,04381157,6,"June 1, 2015",Chinese,Carbon dioxide,,20.0,2274-2279,,2015,Chemical Industry Press,Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal,,Investigation of operational performance of high power CO2heat pump hot water system,,Climatic conditions - Coefficient of Performance - Constant temperature - Hot water system - Internal heat exchanger - Operational parameters - Operational performance - Thermal Performance,66,
"Proc. Int. Conf. Orange Technol., ICOT","Due to the popularity and ubiquity of social networks, sentiment analysis has become an important and well-covered research area. Short texts usually encounter sparsity problems in representations for their limited texts length. We address this issue by clustering short texts to form a long text. Specifically, we first use k-means clustering algorithms to form k clusters, where each cluster contains texts having close semantic similarity with the same sentiment polarity. Then, these clusters are used to train classifier. In evaluation, the unlabeled text is merged to the most similar positive and negative clusters respectively, and its sentiment polarity is determined by the change of the two clusters' probabilistic estimates.

RSC Adv.,"A sensitive and selective electrochemical approach for cholesterol sensing based on a competitive host-guest recognition between β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and a signal probe (methylene blue)/target molecule (cholesterol) using a β-CD/poly(N-acetylaniline)/graphene (β-CD/PNAANI/Gra)-modified electrode was developed. Due to the host-guest interaction, MB molecules can enter into the hydrophobic inner cavity of β-CD, and the β-CD/PNAANI/Gra modified glassy carbon electrode displays a remarkable anodic peak. In the presence of cholesterol, a competitive interaction to β-CD occurs and the MB molecules are displaced by cholesterol. This results in a decreased oxidation peak current of MB as MB is a well known redox probe and hence can be easily detected using the differential pulse voltammetery technique. A linear response range of 1.00 to 50.00 μM for cholesterol with a low detection limit of 0.50 μM (S/N = 3) was obtained by using the indirect method. The proposed method could be successfully utilized to detect cholesterol in serum samples, and may be expanded to analysis of other non-electroactive species. Besides, the host-guest interaction between cholesterol and β-CD was studied by molecular modeling calculations, which revealed that the complexation could reduce the energy of the system and the complex of 2:1 host-guest stoichiometry had the lowest ΔE value of -10.45 kcal mol-1. The molecular docking studies suggested that hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions should be the major driving forces for the formation of the inclusion complex. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20153201113956,,"Yang, Long (1); Zhao, Hui (2); Fan, Shuangmei (1); Zhao, Genfu (1); Ran, Xin (1); Li, Can-Peng (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-resource, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,"704.1 Electric Components - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics",,,,,Aromatic compounds - Chemical detection - Complexation - Cyclodextrins - Glass membrane electrodes - Hydrogen bonds - Hydrophobicity - Molecular modeling - Molecules - Probes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Can-Peng(lcppp1974@sina.com) ",10.1039/c5ra11420a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,79,2015,English,Cholesterol,,24.0,64146-64155,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Electrochemical detection of cholesterol based on competitive host-guest recognition using a β-cyclodextrin/poly(N-acetylaniline)/graphene-modified electrode,,Competitive interactions - Electroactive species - ELectrochemical detection - Host guest interactions - Host-guest recognition - Hydrophobic interactions - Linear response range - Modified glassy carbon electrode,5,
Mater. Sci. Forum,"Microstructural transformations and mechanical properties of a low carbon martensite stainless bearing steel treated with different heat treatment parameters and cryogenic treatment (-82 ) were investigated. The function of microstructural transformations on strengthening and toughening process was quantitatively characterized as well. These analyses were performed by the optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD) technique. The obtained results show that with execution of cryogenic treatment and tempering, the tensile strength increase owing to the reduction of retained austenite and fine carbides precipitating respectively. The effect of martensitic microstructure on yield strength increment can be regarded as packet size and block width which conform to Hall-Petch relationship. Meanwhile, the results suggest that the block width is the key structural controlling unit when analyzing the strength-structure relationship of lath martensite in low carbon martensite stainless bearing steel. In addition, packet size can be related to toughness controlling as well because of the same size as cleavage plane. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",,,20151700772479,,"Yuan, Xiao Hong (1, 2); Yang, Mao Sheng (2); Zhao, Kun Yu (1) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan Province; 650093, China (2) Institute of Special Steel, Central Iron and Steel Research Institute, Beijing; 100081, China ",MSFOEP,531.1 Metallurgy - 531.2 Metallography - 545.3 Steel - 601.2 Machine Components - 644.4 Cryogenics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 951 Materials Science,117499.0,"July 4, 2014 - July 7, 2014","Chengdu, China","Chinese Materials Congress, CMC 2014",Backscattering - Bearings (machine parts) - Carbides - Cryogenics - Martensite - Martensitic transformations - Microstructure - Scanning electron microscopy - Stainless steel - Strengthening (metal) - Tensile strength - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction - Yield stress,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Kun Yu(zhaokunyu.kmust@gmail.com) ",10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.817.667,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783038353966.0,02555476,,2015,English,Low carbon steel,,21.0,667-674,1of1,2015,Trans Tech Publications Ltd,Materials Science Forum,,Effects of microstructure transformation on strengthening and toughening for heat-treated low carbon martensite stainless bearing steel,,EBSD - Electron back scattering diffraction techniques - Hall Petch relationship - Impact energy - Lath martensite - Martensitic microstructure - Microstructural transformations - Microstructure transformations,817,Basic Research of Materials
Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"A novel and simple method for the sensitive determination of trace amounts of nitrite in human urine and blood has been developed by combination of cloud point extraction (CPE) and microplate assay. The method is based on the Griess reaction and the reaction product is extracted into nonionic surfactant Triton-X114 using CPE technique. In this study, decolorization treatment of urine and blood was applied to overcome the interference of matrix and enhance the sensitivity of nitrite detection. Multi-sample can be simultaneously detected thanks to a 96-well microplate technique. The effects of different operating parameters such as type of decolorizing agent, concentration of surfactant (Triton X-114), addition of (NH4)2SO4,extraction temperature and time, interfering elements were studied and optimum conditions were obtained. Under the optimum conditions, a linear calibration graph was obtained in the range of 10-400 ng mL-1of nitrite with limit of detection (LOD) of 2.5 ng mL-1. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for determination of 100 ng mL-1of nitrite was 2.80%. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of nitrite in the urine and blood samples with recoveries of 92.6-101.2%. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Guangxue Xuebao,"The volatiles of Bulbus Allii Macrostemonis from different areas and different original plants have been studied by headspace combined with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using nano-silver colloid as substrate. Volatile SERS spectra of Allium macrostemon Bunge from four different areas and Allium chinense from Chuxiong are very similar and well repeated. The peaks at 375, 635, 673, 712, 781, 893, 1025, 1086, 1222, 1322, 1629 cm-1 in their volatile SERS spectra match well with each other. The volatile SERS spectra are compared respectively with the volatile SERS spectra of liquid allyl methyl sulfide, 1-propanethiol and their mixture. The results show that the volatile SERS spectra of Allium macrostemon Bunge and Allium chinense are basically consistent with that of the mixture of liquid allyl methyl sulfide and 1-propanethiol. It illustrates that volatiles of Allium macrostemon Bunge from different areas and Allium chinense from Chuxiong contain allyl methyl sulfide and 1-propanethiol.

Sensors,"Eu-doped In2O3nanobelts (Eu-In2O3NBs) and pure In2O3nanobelts (In2O3NBs) are synthesized by the carbon thermal reduction method. Single nanobelt sensors are fabricated via an ion beam deposition system with a mesh-grid mask. The gas-sensing response properties of the Eu-In2O3NB device and its undoped counterpart are investigated with several kinds of gases (including H2S, CO, NO2, HCHO, and C2H5OH) at different concentrations and different temperatures. It is found that the response of the Eu-In2O3NB device to 100 ppm of H2S is the best among these gases and the sensitivity reaches 5.74, which is five times that of pure In2O3NB at 260 °C. We also found that the former has an excellent sensitive response and great selectivity to H2S compared to the latter. Besides, there is a linear relationship between the response and H2S concentration when its concentration changes from 5 to 100 ppm and from 100 to 1000 ppm. The response/recovery time is quite short and remains stable with an increase of H2S concentration. These results mean that the doping of Eu can improve the gas-sensing performance of In2O3NB effectually. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,Open Access,20155001656757,,"Chen, Weiwu (1); Liu, Yingkai (1); Qin, Zhaojun (1); Wu, Yuemei (1); Li, Shuanghui (1); Ai, Peng (1) ","(1) Institute of Physics and Electronic Information Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Chemical detection - Chemical sensors - Europium compounds - Gas detectors - Gases - Ion beam assisted deposition - Ion beams - Nanobelts,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Yingkai(ykliu@ynnu.edu.cn) ",10.3390/s151229775,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,14248220,12,"November 30, 2015",English,Indium compounds,,31.0,29950-29957,,2015,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Sensors (Switzerland),,A single eu-doped In2O3nanobelt device for selective H2S detection,,Carbon-thermal reduction - Concentration change - Gas sensing response - H2 - Ion beam deposition systems - Linear relationships - Nanobelt sensors - Response/recovery time,15,

The effects of the contents of the calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) on the relative density, microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites were investigated. The results show that the composites are consisted of β-Ti phase matrix, a little residual α-Ti phase and CPP phase. The α-Ti phase of the composites increases with the increasing of the content of the CPP. Furthermore, CPP would decompose due to its excessive content in the composites. The composites present a lower compressive elastic modulus in the range of 40~62 GPa and a higher compressive strength level more than 1000 MPa, and it exhibits a better mechanical compatibility. However, the compressive elastic modulus of the composites significantly increases when the CPP is excessive, and then it would do harm to the mechanical compatibility of the composites.

Mater. Res. Innov.,"High-strength steel ADB610 is a low carbon bainite steel and was newly developed in China. Fatigue crack propagation rate experiments and metallographic experiments for butt welded joints of steel ADB610 were investigated. The welding method is shielded metal arc welding. The fatigue crack propagation experiments were done under a constant load using compact tension samples and MTS810 TestStar materials testing facility at the stress ratio of 01. Seven data polynomial method was used to calculate fatigue crack propagation rate (da/dN) of each compact tension samples. All da/dN and ?K of base metal samples, heat-affected zone samples and weld metal samples were fitted, respectively, and the formula based on Paris for base metal, heat-affected zone and weld metal were obtained. Fatigue crack propagation experimental results indicate that fatigue crack propagation rate in base metal is higher than that in heat-affected zone and weld metal, and the one in weld metal is the slowest during the early and middle stage of crack propagation, but during the end stage of crack propagation the fatigue crack propagation rates for the three regions of steel ADB610 welded joints were nearly at the same level with slight fluctuations with each other. The metallographic experiments show that the crystal grains in the weld metal were finer than those in the heat affected zone and base metal, and the heat-affected zone microstructure was meshy. So the resistance against fatigue crack propagation in the weld metal is higher than that in the heat-affected zone and base metal, and the resistance against fatigue crack propagation in the heat-affected zone is higher than that in the base metal. The fatigue crack propagation difference of steel ADB610 welded joins from metallographic experiments is consistent with the result from fatigue crack propagation experiments. © W. S.

Firstly, we divide clusters with hierarchic methods, and manage the clustering results with a tree structure, which can reduce the amount of computation and the CPU cost under the precondition of ensuring filtering capabilities. Secondly, a new pruning algorithm is designed to reject the irrelevant points further in the candidate clusters and reduce the IO cost.

These two favored materials are expected to obtain by the electromagnetic directional solidification of hypereutectic Al-Si melts. The segregation of hypereutectic Al-Si alloy is feasible with respect to the process of either pull-up or drop-down in electromagnetic directional solidification. To explore the segregation efficiency, experiments have been conducted in a high-frequency induction furnace with different pulling conditions of hypereutectic Al-Si melts. The results show that the segregation efficiency of dropping-down is higher than that of pulling-up; the slower dropping-down rate lead to higher segregation efficiency in the electromagnetic directional solidification; increasing the temperature gradient may promote the separation efficiency.

Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao,"Here, we addressed extraction of As and Sb by vacuum distillation from a variety of Cu-Ni alloys containing Ar and Sb impurities, such as slug and flue-dust of metallurgical plants. The influence of the extraction conditions, including but not limited to the pressure, distillation temperature and time, contents of Cu, Ni, and Ag, on the evaporation rates of As and Sb was experimentally investigated. The Cu-Ni alloys, condensates and slug were characterized with X-ray diffraction, respectively. The results show that the distillation temperature and time strongly affect the extraction rates of As and Sb. For instance, below 1473 K, coexistence of As and Sb in stable Cu3As and Cu5As2 compounds accounted for incomplete evaporation of As; but above 1474 K, fully decomposition of Cu3As and Cu5 was responsible for complete evaporation of As. Besides, as the temperature increased from 1573 to 1673 K, the evaporation rate of Sb significantly increased possibly because of increasing partial decomposition of Sb-containing Cu and Ni compounds. ©, 2015, Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao/Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology.

Voltage and current of line startcan be measured, but distance measuring device based on reflection principle often fails in timely capture of transient fault and accurate fault location. Current constructed with direction is used to determine fault and discriminate faulted electrode line. Wavelet coefficients containing DC component is used to calculate DC component, achieving accurate calculation of electrode site resistor. Based on this, fault location method based on π-type equivalent circuit model of line and harmonic impedance components is proposed. Simulation and measurement results show that this location algorithm has high accuracy for fault location near measurement place. © 2015, Power System Technology Press.

RSC Adv.,"Pursuit of light harvesting is a persistent objective for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here we report the synthesis of titanium dioxide/silica (TiO2/SiO2) nanocrystallite photoanodes, aiming at elevating the light harvesting for dye excitation. Due to light interference effect of the reflected light beams from TiO2/SiO2and SiO2/electrolyte interfaces, the dye excitation and therefore the photocurrent density are markedly enhanced. The photovoltaic performances of the resultant DSSCs are optimized by utilizing three TiO2/SiO2photoanodes from different synthetic strategies. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 8.56% is measured under simulated air mass 1.5 global sunlight in comparison with 7.06% from pristine TiO2based DSSC. The high power conversion efficiency in combination with simple preparation demonstrates the potential for utilization of TiO2/SiO2nanocrystallite anodes in efficient DSSCs.

Tob. Sci. Technol.,"To investigate the effects of diammonium phosphate (DAP) on the free nicotine release in smoke and sensory quality of cigarette, DAP solution was sprayed on equivalent cut tobaccos so that the mass percentages of DAP in cut tobacco became 0, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, respectively. The method of determining free nicotine in cigarette smoke was optimized. The pH of cut tobacco and the release of free nicotine in cigarette smoke were determined, and the sensory quality of cigarette was evaluated. The correlation of DAP addition rate with free nicotine release in cigarette smoke and cut tobacco pH were analyzed. The results showed that: 1)To extract and separate the free and bound nicotine in cigarette smoke with chloroform-neutral water system, the RSD was 3.46% and the recoveries ranged from 84.7% to 88.7%. 2)Within the tested range, DAP addition rate significantly positively linearly correlated to cut tobacco pH and free nicotine release in cigarette smoke. 3)The roasted aroma increased and impact of cigarette smoke generally presented an upward trend with the increase of DAP application rate not beyond 1.0%. At low addition rate, the major functions of DAP in cigarette were promoting the Maillard reaction in tobacco, improving roasted aroma and enriching tobacco aroma. © 2015, Editorial Office of Tobacco Science & Technology.

Forests,"Identifying the main sources of conflict and understanding the relationships between protected areas and local communities are critical to conflict resolution related to protected area management. We surveyed and assessed the perceptions of local people related to forest values of the Bulong Nature Reserve (BNR), Yunnan, China, and their attitudes toward forest management of the recently-established nature reserve. Factors influencing the differences in perceptions and attitudes were investigated. Our results indicated local residents preferred the economic value of forests, and they perceived more forest values after reserve establishment than before, especially for ecological services. Interviewees believed the value of the forests have increased, and predicted that the forest will have increased importance to their livelihoods and health in the future. Nonetheless, the majority of interviewees were dissatisfied with current reserve management. Variation in these perceptions and attitudes were related to several social variables: age, gender, education, and distance from the reserve. Embedding the findings of the present study, specifically the perceptions and attitudes of local people, into management guidelines for mitigation of potential conflicts is proposed and should help managers to achieve biodiversity-related goals. This study offers new insights related to the identification of the underlying sources of conflict in forest management and provides a better understanding of the relationship between local people and protected areas. The study also contributes to the literature on forest values of indigenous populations by examining those of remote, rural populations in China. © 2015 by the authors.",,Open Access,20154601540321,,"Yang, Hua (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); Harrison, Rhett (1, 5, 6); Yi, Zhuang-Fang (1, 5, 6); Goodale, Eben (7); Zhao, Ming-Xu (1, 2); Xu, Jian-Chu (1, 5, 6) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650201, China (2) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100049, China (3) Sugar Cane Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 363 Lingquan East Road, Kaiyuan; 661660, China (4) Program for Field Studies in Tropical Asia, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Menglun, Mengla; 666303, China (5) Centre for Mountain Ecosystem Studies, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650201, China (6) World Agroforestry Centre, East and Central Asia Regional Office, Kunming; 650201, China (7) Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla; 666303, China ",,454 Environmental Engineering - 454.2 Environmental Impact and Protection - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Biodiversity - Conservation - Environmental protection - Forestry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Jian-Chu(jxu@mail.kib.ac.cn) ",10.3390/f6093136,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19994907,,,,,9,2015,English,Behavioral research,,94.0,3136-3164,,2015,"MDPI AG, Postfach, Basel, CH-4005, Switzerland",Forests,,Changing perceptions of forest value and attitudes toward management of a recently established nature reserve: A case study in southwest China,,China - Conflict Resolution - Ecological services - Forest value - Nature reserves - Protected area management - Protected areas - Reserve management,6,
Sep. Sci. Technol.,"The work presented here investigates the optimum conditions for maximum recovery of iron from the waste slag. The most advantageous option for industrial trial is roasting of the waste slag under reducing condition followed by magnetic separation selected from various options for recovery of iron from the waste slag. The experimental results show that under the treatment condition in this work, about 70% of the iron was recovered from the waste slag, where the iron content in the concentrate is 57%. After further treatment with chlorinated segregation-magnetic separation, the iron content in the recovered slag can reach 83%. After the treatment, sulphur content in the concentrate was reduced significantly and gangue materials, such as SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2, were reduced effectively. This paper is mainly focused on the results of reduction roasting- magnetic separation.

In this paper, we present a novel method, using morphological technique, for granules segmentation in the solar photosphere. Firstly, a morphological filtering, employing opening-by-reconstruction and closing-by-reconstruction, is used to eliminate image noise. Secondly, Otsu technique is implemented to obtain an adaptive threshold. We use hole filling technique to fill the hole in the granular region. Finally, the Sobel edge-segmentation operator is utilized to extract the boundary of granules. It showed that the proposed method yields more accurate segmentation results than the watershed method, implying that it can be to further analyze such as granular evolution or statistical properties. © 2014 IEEE.",,,20152600976938,7053273.0,"Deng, Linhua (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China (2) Key Laboratory of Astronomical Optics and Technology, Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China ",,,112312.0,"June 29, 2014 - July 4, 2014","Shenyang, China","2014 11th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation, WCICA 2014",,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Deng, Linhua ",10.1109/WCICA.2014.7053273,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,,,March,"March 2, 2015",English,,"Proceeding of the 11th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation, WCICA 2014",24.0,3364-3368,1 of 1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Proceedings of the World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA),,Automatic segmentation of solar granulations based on Morphology technique,,,2015-March,

Tob. Sci. Technol.,"To determine the flavor type of cigarette more objectively and scientifically and provide theoretical basis and guidance for cigarette blending, the volatile and semi-volatile substances in cut fillers of cigarettes were extracted by optimized simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE), and the key aroma components were screened out by stepwise regression analysis, so that a model for quantitatively discriminating the flavor type of cigarette was developed. The flavor types of eight cigarette samples were determined by the developed model and parallely compared with their sensory evaluation results based on smell profile method for model validation. The results showed that: 1) Ten key aroma components were screened out, which in the order of their contribution to cigarette flavor type were farnesyl acetone > palmitic acid > 4-cyclopentene-1, 3-dione > benzyl benzoate > myristic acid > dihydroactinidiolide > benzyl alcohol > methyl hexadecanoate > furfural > megastigmatrienone. The regression equation of the said ten components versus cigarette flavor type index Yquantity was of extremely significant level, it indicated that the developed model possessed high reliability. 2) The flavor types of the eight cigarette samples determined by the two methods were pretty well consistent with each other with the coincidence rate of 86.67%. © 2015, Editorial Office of Tobacco Science and Technology.

XRD, XPS and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests reveal that olivine phase is observed exclusively in LiMn1-xVxPO4/C (0x0.05) samples and the valence of the doped V is +3, whereas a minor amount of Li3V2(PO4)3is additionally detected in the LiMn1-xVxPO4/C at x=0.075. SEM observation shows that much smaller crystals of V-doped LiMnPO4can be obtained at relatively high temperatures by our synthesis method and consequently more vanadium can be incorporated into the lattice of LiMnPO4. Electrochemical test demonstrates that a proper amount of V doping on the Mn-site in LiMnPO4can effectively enhance its electrochemical performance due to the reduced resistance of charge transfer, and the LiMn1-xVxPO4/C at x=0.025 exhibits the best rate performance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. and Techna Group S.r.l.

Then the powder was tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to analyze the phase composition and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe the surface morphology and particle size of the powder. The effects of sintering temperature, holding time and the mass ratio of ball and feed on the performance of the IGZO powders were studied. The results showed that: Ga2O3and ZnO react to ZnGa2O4at the sintering temperature of 1100 for 6 h, and the ZnGa2O4phase is the main component of the resulting powder, while there still exists In2O3which does not react.

Can. J. Chem. Eng.,"In this paper, we synthesized a novel structure of sulfoxide, benzyl 2-ethylhexyl sulfoxide (BSO), and evaluated its performance for extracting phenol. The influences of several variables on phenol extraction were investigated, including equilibrium time, pH value, temperature, and salts in the aqueous phase. It was found the BSO dissolved in kerosene was an effective extractant for the recovery of phenol from an aqueous solution at pH=2. The transfer mechanism of phenol into the organic phase was proved to be the solvation reaction by BSO through hydrogen bonds as a phenol: BSO 1:1 complex.

The approach consists of three steps. First, the overlapping area of two aerial images is extracted. Then, the two overlapping area images are fused adaptively by the method of multi-layer wavelet decomposition based on the structure similarity and appointed regulation. Finally, weighted average fusion is used again to avoid the visible boundary line for the both sides of the boundary of the above fusion image.

J Porous Mater,"We prepared activated carbon with high specific surface area from walnut shells by chemical activation with KOH and microwave heating. To optimize the preparation process, we applied the response surface methodology technique. We then investigated the influences of microwave power, activation time, and KOH/C weight ratio on the yield and iodine adsorption capacity of the activated carbon. The results revealed that the optimum conditions were: microwave power 700 W, activation time 20 min, and KOH/C weight ratio 4, corresponding to a yield of 40 % and an iodine number of 2558 mg/g. The pore structure parameters of the activated carbon, i.e., Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter, were estimated to be 3923 m2/g, 2.778 ml/g, and 2.32 nm, respectively, under optimum conditions. The activated carbon and char were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. FTIR showed that the chemical groups of the activated carbon had changed, and SEM revealed that the activated carbon had lots of small, irregular pores on its surface.

Comput. Therm. Sci.,"The natural convection flow in an inclined differentially heated cavity is investigated numerically with two-dimensional simulations at Rayleigh number Ra = 1 × 107and Ra = 1 × 108for Prandtl number Pr = 7.0. At θ = 0, the problem is the standard canonical differentially heated cavity flow with isothermal “hot” and “cold” vertical walls and with adiabatic horizontal walls. As the angle of inclination is increased, with the hot wall situated below the cold wall, the flow approaches an unstable Rayleigh–Bernard type flow. Below a critical angle the fully developed flow is steady and exhibits the same basic structure of the standard cavity flow. As the angle of inclination is increased, the flow undergoes a bifurcation so that the fully developed flow is unsteady and single mode. The bifurcation takes the form of traveling waves continually circulating the periphery of the cavity. These waves are supported by convectively unstable natural convection boundary layers on the heated/cooled walls and by attached plumes on the adiabatic walls. It is the establishment of these plumes coupling the opposing boundary layers which provides the mechanism for absolutely unstable flow. © 2015 by Begell House, Inc.",,,20170803373234,,"Williamson, Nicholas (1); Armfield, Steven W.

Int. J. Wireless Mobile Comput.,"wireless sensor network (WSN) generally includes a large amount of cheap embedded equipment powered by battery. Therefore, the WSN is restricted in the aspect of resource dissipation. When designing WSN it is one of the core problems to optimise the power dissipation in order to lengthen the network life. In real-world usage, nodes of WSN are often densely distributed because nowadays the hardware cost of sensor nodes is relatively low. The net topological structure can be optimised by taking advantage of the data redundancy brought out by extra nodes. Thus we present a Self-Adaptive Sleep Scheduling (SASS) algorithm against the energy-conserving problem of high-density WSN on the basis of a classic topology control algorithm: ASCENT. We improve the state transition mechanism of ASCENT and take the data redundancy into consideration. Through the experiments, it is proved that SASS is more energy efficient and improves the stability. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",,,20153201126127,,"Zhang, Jing (1); Yan, Han (1); Wang, Bin (1); Wang, Jianping (1); Fu, Xiaodong (1) ","(1) School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China ",,"461.4 Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering - 525.2 Energy Conservation - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Energy conservation - Energy efficiency - Redundancy - Scheduling - Sleep research - Topology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yan, Han(yanhan006@163.com) ",10.1504/IJWMC.2015.070939,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17411092,,,,17411084,4,2015,English,Sensor nodes,,18.0,346-352,,2015,Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.,International Journal of Wireless and Mobile Computing,,Self-adaptive sleep scheduling for wireless sensor networks,,ASCENT - Embedded equipments - Energy-conserving - Sleep scheduling - State transitions - Topological structure - Topology control - Topology control algorithms,8,

Hydrometallurgy,"A direct solvent-extraction process was developed to selectively recover indium from solutions generated by reductive leaching of zinc residues. This approach avoids the traditional steps of intermediate precipitation, solid-liquid separation, and re-leaching. Copper in the leach solution is easily removed by cementation with iron powder and the remaining Fe(III) is reduced to the ferrous state, which avoids the possibility of its co-extraction with indium. Indium is effectively extracted from the zinc sulfate solution by 20% (v/v) di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) dissolved in kerosene at an initial pH of 0.5 and aqueous-to-organic phase ratio (A:O) of 6:1 using three countercurrent stages. Indium extraction is 96.1%, zinc and iron are barely extracted, and the separation factors of indium with respect to zinc and iron are 3640 and 4809, respectively. The complete stripping of indium from the loaded organic phase is achieved using 4 mol/L HCl at an A:O of 1:6. A scheme for direct solvent extraction of indium in zinc hydrometallurgical processing is suggested, by which indium can be concentrated into a small volume of strip solution containing 11 g/L of indium, which is 85 times its concentration in the feed solution. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20152000851745,,"Li, Xingbin (1); Deng, Zhigan (1); Li, Cunxiong (1); Wei, Chang (1); Li, Minting (1); Fan, Gang (1); Rong, Hao (1) ","(1) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China ",HYDRDA,549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Chlorine compounds - Indium - Iron compounds - Leaching - Phosphoric acid - Precipitation (chemical) - Solvents - Stripping (removal) - Sulfur compounds - Zinc compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wei, Chang(weichang502@sina.cn) ",10.1016/j.hydromet.2015.05.003,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014CB643404, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20115314110001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51474115, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51304093, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51174104, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51474117, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB643404 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51304093 , 51174104 , 51474117 , and 51474115 ), and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (No. 20115314110001 ).",,0304386X,,"May 6, 2015",English,Solvent extraction,,32.0,1-5,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Hydrometallurgy,,Direct solvent extraction of indium from a zinc residue reductive leach solution by D2EHPA,,Counter current - Di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid - Direct solvents - Hydrometallurgical processing - Indium extraction - Reductive leaching - Separation factors - Solid liquid separation,156,

Bull. Environ. Contam.

Although the unicellular and colonial strains of M. aeruginosa were both inhibited by A. calamus, unicellular algae were more sensitive than the colonial algae. The measurement results for EPS, MDA, CAT, and POD showed that unicellular M. aeruginosa had higher levels of stress related damage than colonial strains when they were exposed to the same density of A. calamus, and the cellular defense system of colonial M. aeruginosa was stronger than that of unicellular M. aeruginosa. Natural blooms of Microcystis are typically composed of colonial forms of M. aeruginosa, therefore future efforts to control such blooms, possibly through the development of new algicides, should focus on the unique characteristics of colonial M. aeruginosa strains. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",,,20151500731716,,"Zhang, S.-H.

World Trans. Eng. Technol. Edu.,"As China's high-speed rail technology increasingly becomes mature, it is inevitable that China's high-speed rail expertise will expand throughout the world. However, there is still a large gap between supply and demand for talent in civil engineering (CE). Few universities offer a CE major for international students. The railway universities of China have a short history in dealing with international students and, hence, lack experience and also use outdated educational methods. Chinese language education at present cannot meet the requirements of the CE employment market. In this article, the current situation in Chinese language education is showcased, with an analysis of the existing problems.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","Graphene (GR)-wrapped WO3nanosphere composite was synthesized by using a facile sol-gel method. The morphology and structural properties of the GR-WO3nanocomposites were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The GR-wrapped WO3nanospheres composite exhibits p-type gas sensing behavior and the response of GR-WO3sensor toward NO2shows a linear increase with an increase in the concentration from 7 to 56 ppm at room temperature. Upon exposure to 56 ppm NO2, its response value becomes 40.8%, but there is no responsiveness for the sensors based on pure WO3and graphene sensors. The effective charge transfer through chemically bonded interfacial contact between graphene and WO3nanospheres is proposed to be responsible for the room temperature sensing performance. This work may provide a new insight into the structural design of GR-base nanocomposites and has a potential prospect in the environment monitoring or disease detection of NO2at room temperature. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Binggong Xuebao,"Variable integral time is an effective means to realize the high dynamic range (HDR) of infrared system. Unfortunately, it would lead to serious residual non-uniformity. The relationship between the correction parameters (gain and offset) of two-point non-uniform correction (NUC) and integral time is derived based on the infrared system response model. The result shows that the gain parameters are independent of integral time, and only the bias parameters change with integral time. The correctness of the above conclusions is confirmed by testing it against standard two-point NUC method. The result can provide a reasonable evidence for NUC of infrared system with variable integral time, which only updates the offset parameters but maintain same gain parameters. ©, 2015, China Ordnance Society.

Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol.,"An alpha-galactosidase was purified from Pseudobalsamia microspora (PMG) to 1224.1-fold with a specific activity of 11,274.5 units/mg by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. PMG is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 62 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and by gel filtration. Chemical modification using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) resulted in a complete abrogation of the activity of PMG, suggesting that Trp is an amino acid essential to its activity. The activity was strongly inhibited by Hg2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ ions. Three inner peptide sequences for PMG were obtained by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS–MS) analysis. When 4-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside (pNPGal) was used as substrate, the optimum pH and temperature of PMG were 5.0 and 55 °C, respectively. The Michaelis constant (Km) value of the alpha-galactosidase on pNPGal was 0.29 mM, and the maximal velocity (Vmax) was 0.97 μmol ml−1 min−1. Investigation by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) demonstrated its ability to hydrolyze raffinose and stachyose.

Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.,"Ammonia-borane (AB) is a promising chemical hydrogen-storage material. However, the development of real-time, efficient, controllable, and safe methods for hydrogen release under mild conditions is a challenge in the large-scale use of hydrogen as a long-term solution for future energy security. A new class of low-cost catalytic system is presented that uses nanostructured Ni2P as catalyst, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity and high sustainability toward hydrolysis of ammonia-borane with the initial turnover frequency of 40.4 mol(H2)mol(Ni2P)-1min-1under air atmosphere and at ambient temperature. This value is higher than those reported for noble-metal-free catalysts, and the obtained Arrhenius activation energy (Ea=44.6 kJ mol-1) for the hydrolysis reaction is comparable to Ru-based bimetallic catalysts.

Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"In this work, we designed a new fluorescent oligonucleotides-stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCs) probe for sensitive detection of mercury and copper ions. This probe contains two tailored DNA sequence. One is a signal probe contains a cytosine-rich sequence template for AgNCs synthesis and link sequence at both ends. The other is a guanine-rich sequence for signal enhancement and link sequence complementary to the link sequence of the signal probe. After hybridization, the fluorescence of hybridized double-strand DNA/AgNCs is 200-fold enhanced based on the fluorescence enhancement effect of DNA/AgNCs in proximity of guanine-rich DNA sequence. The double-strand DNA/AgNCs probe is brighter and stable than that of single-strand DNA/AgNCs, and more importantly, can be used as novel fluorescent probes for detecting mercury and copper ions. Mercury and copper ions in the range of 6.0-160.0 and 6-240 nM, can be linearly detected with the detection limits of 2.1 and 3.4 nM, respectively. Our results indicated that the analytical parameters of the method for mercury and copper ions detection are much better than which using a single-strand DNA/AgNCs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Int. Conf. Fuzzy Syst. Knowl. Discov., FSKD","Social networks are usually modeled by graphs, where the nodes represent actors, and edges indicate interactions amongst actors. In the real world, social networks are mostly multi-relational, i.e., actors are related through different relationship types, such as friendship, kinship and co-authorship. A multi-relational social network can be represented by multiple single-relational graphs, each reflecting one kind of relation. Acquiring information contained in a multi-relational social network, such as which actors interact frequently in which relationships, can help us to understand the network comprehensively and then offer better services. This paper develops a system (SQNR: A System for Querying Nodes and Relations) to query nodes that interact frequently in the specified relationships and to query relationships in which the specified community patterns (limitations of the community memberships of some actors, such as belong to the same community) can be satisfied. Twelve community patterns can be specified in this paper.

Teh. Vjesn.,"This paper presents a non-photorealistic rendering technique for producing flow-like abstraction stylization from a photograph. Based on anisotropic Kuwahara filtering in conjunction with line integral convolution, our method abstracts shapes and colors simultaneously while preserving features of images. In particular, we develop an edge detection and dilation method, to draw attention to salient features and image boundaries. This proposed algorithm is incremental and iterative, and therefore the degree of flow and abstraction can be controlled. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness of our method in producing a coherent and flow-like abstraction stylization is satisfactory yet preserving features and directions from photographs. © 2015, Strojarski Facultet.

SAE Techni. Paper.,"Tractor semi-trailer as a widely-used heavy duty freight vehicle has caused many fatal accidents every year and one of the main factors of which may relate to its relatively poor lateral dynamics performance compared to the passenger cars [1, 2, 3]. In this paper, attention is concentrated on the parametric design for a tractor semi-trailer by optimizing the configuration parameters aiming to comprehensively improve the lateral dynamics performance. According to the previous public reports, the performance measures such as Load Transfer Ratio (LTR), Static Rollover Threshold (SRT), Rearward Amplification Ratio (RAR) and Ratio of Yaw Rate (RYR) are very effective measures and often be used to evaluate the handling and stability performances for tractor-trailer vehicles. However, each of those measures only pays attention to a certain aspect of vehicle lateral dynamics which is closely related to vehicle configuration parameters. Especially, the load scenario in transport which often varies from one task to another can make the lateral dynamics change considerably. Therefore it is difficult for a vehicle to obtain a comprehensively satisfying handling-stability performance in a wide range of load scenarios. In this work, two relatively comprehensive measures which directly link with vehicle configuration parameters have been formulated based on multivariable linear regression (MVLR) method respectively corresponding to the body roll and yaw dynamics in order to facilitate the implementation of handling- stability oriented design method. As an example, an optimal design scheme based on Multi-Objective Linear Programming (MOLP) method is presented and a set of optimum parameters are obtained. The handling and stability performances after optimization have been compared with those before optimization by simulations in TruckSim. © Copyright 2015 SAE International.",,,20160801956375,,"Yang, Xiujian (1); Zhu, Ruocheng (1); Gao, Jin (1) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming City, Yunnan Province, China ",,432.3 Cargo Highway Transportation - 662.1 Automobiles - 663.1 Heavy Duty Motor Vehicles - 663.2 Heavy Duty Motor Vehicle Components - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,115955.0,"October 6, 2015 - October 8, 2015","Rosemont, IL, United states","SAE Commercial Vehicle Engineering Congress, COMVEC 2015",Accidents - Automobiles - Commercial vehicles - Dynamics - Linear programming - Stability - Structures (built objects) - Tractors (agricultural) - Tractors (truck) - Truck trailers - Truck transportation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Xiujian(yangxiujian2013@163.com) ",10.4271/2015-01-2753,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),01487191,,,,,,2015,English,Vehicle performance,,10.0,,1of1,2015,SAE International,SAE Technical Papers,BOSCH; Continental; EATON; et al.; PACCAR; SIEMENS,Handling-Stability Oriented Parameter Optimization for a Tractor Semi-Trailer Vehicle,,Configuration parameters - Handling and stabilities - Multi-objective linear programming - Multi-variable linear regression - Parameter optimization - Tractor semi trailers - Vehicle configuration - Vehicle lateral dynamics,2015-September,

In this paper, we propose a New OBU (NOBU) scheme of combining smart phone with Customized 802.11p Device. Since smart phone is generally equipped with powerful computing and storing device, GPS and electronic map, in our proposed scheme, it is utilized as a platform to run routing strategy and all kinds of applications of VANETs. By USB cable, the smart phone can readily connect with a customized 802.11p device, and thus access VANETs. As smart phones have been becoming so popular that almost every driver own one, the scheme will provide vehicles, especially for low- and middle-price ones, with a chance to access VANETs in a feasible, low-cost and efficient way.

Res. Environ. Sci.,"The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of mycorrhizal inhibition and intercropping systems on reduction of P transport on red soil in Dianchi Watershed. A field runoff simulation experiment was conducted from May 25th to October 21st in 2013, the maize and soybean intercropping soil m runoff areas were selected, the mono-maize and mono-soybean control respectively were designed, and the mycorrhizal inhibition treatment (benomyl application can inhibit the growth of fungi) and none mycorrhizal inhibition (NM) treatment were designed respectively. The characteristics of runoff P transference after complex intercropping maize/soybean and mycorrhizal inhibition treatment were studied. The results showed that total P (TP), particulate P (PP) and soluble P (SP) concentrations in runoff water were not obviously changed over the sampling time in the rainy season except for July 19th. The NM inhibition-intercropping treatment had the lowest TP concentration in runoff water among all the combined treatments. TP concentration in runoff for the intercropping treatment was lower 25.6% and 12.2% lower than for mono-maize and mono-soybean treatment under NM-intercropping conditions, respectively. Whether the mycorrhizal inhibition was applied or not, compared with the mono-maize treatment, intercropping decreased SP concentration in runoff about 24.7%. Under the NM inhibition treatment, PP concentrations in runoff for intercropping treatment were lower 14.3% and 20.2% lower than mono-maize and mono-soybean treatment, respectively, and under the intercropping treatment, PP concentration in runoff for NM inhibition treatment was lower than mycorrhizal inhibition treatment significantly. In addition, regardless of the plant modes, TP content in soil for the mycorrhizal inhibition treatment was lower 9.0% than NM inhibition treatment significantly. Under the mycorrhizal inhibition conditions, compared with the mono-maize treatment, intercropping maize treatment decreased the TP and available P content in soil significantly. Compared with the mycorrhizal inhibition-mono-maize treatment, the NM inhibition-intercropping maize treatment decreased the TP and available P content in soil by 0.25 g/kg and 2.56 mg/kg respectively. Compound mycorrhizal and intercropping treatment reduced P loss in runoff water to some extent on sloped red soil, and had a certain reduction potential on agricultural non-point source pollution in the Dianchi Watershed. ©, 2015, Editorial department of Molecular Catalysis.

Adv. Mater. Sci. Eng.,"Mn2+-doped ZnS semiconductor quantum dots reveal remarkably intense photoluminescence with the4T1(4G) f6A1(6S) transition. In this study, following growth doping technique, Mn2+-doped ZnS quantum dots (ZnS:Mn2+QDs) with high-quality optical properties and narrow size distribution were synthesized successfully. The dopant emission has been optimized with various reaction parameters, and it has been found that the percentage of introduced dopant, reaction temperature, and time as well as the pH of a reaction mixture are key factors for controlling the intensity. Photoluminescence emission (PL) measurements of ZnS:Mn2+QDs show Mn2+d-d orange luminescence along with band-edge blue luminescence. Moreover, the electron transfer from singlet states of hypocrellin A (HA) to colloidal ZnS:Mn2+QDs has been examined by absorption spectra and fluorescence quenching. The absorption spectrum gave an evidence of the increases in the extinction coefficient and the red-shift of the absorption maxima in the absorption spectra of HA in the presence of ZnS:Mn2+QDs, demonstrating the occurrence of surface interactions between the sensitizer and the particle surface. Fluorescence quenching by ZnS:Mn2+QDs also suggested that there were a complex association between HA and ZnS:Mn2+QDs, which was necessary for observing the heterogeneous electron-transfer process at the interface of sensitizer-semiconductor.

J. Ceram. Sci. Technol.,"MgO-Al2O3-SiO2(MAS) glass powders have been successfully synthesized by means of the low-temperature combustion technique using magnesium nitrate, aluminium nitrate and silicic acid as raw materials, and urea as fuel. The sintering behavior, crystallization process and dielectric properties of the MAS were investigated with DCS, XRD, TMA and SEM techniques. The results indicate that the sintering temperature of the as-prepared glass powders decreased with the addition of B2O3and only α-cordierite was precipitated as a main crystal phase, i.e. without μ-cordierite, for the glass powders heated at 1000°C. Moreover, the as-prepared α-cordierite exhibited a dense microstructure, the additive (B2O32.5%) reducing the crystallization temperature of α-cordierite phase from 1050°C to 900°C. The obtained cordierite-based glass-ceramics (sintered at 950°C and 1000°C) have a low dielectric constant (4.00 ∼ 4.03 at 1 MHz), a low dielectric dissipation factor (≈ 0.003) and high sintering density (which is up to 98% of the theoretical density). The properties of as-prepared MAS satisfy all requirements of a material for electronic packaging, making it a promising candidate for application as electronic packaging. © 2015 Göller Verlag.",,,20153601239425,,"He, Y.

Bioresour. Technol.,"Carriers were added to a pilot-scale duckweed-based (Lemna japonica 0223) wastewater treatment system to immobilize and enhance microorganisms. This system and another parallel duckweed system without carriers were operated for 1.5years. The results indicated the addition of the carrier did not significantly affect the growth and composition of duckweed, the recovery of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and CO2or the removal of TP. However, it significantly improved the removal efficiency of TN and NH4+-N (by 19.97% and 15.02%, respectively). The use of 454 pyrosequencing revealed large differences of the microbial communities between the different components within a system and similarities within the same components between the two systems. The carrier biofilm had the highest bacterial diversity and relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria (3%) and denitrifying bacteria (24% of Rhodocyclaceae), which improved nitrogen removal of the system.

Gaodianya Jishu,"The fault diagnosis of substation equipment depends on single characteristic and there is no reserved monitoring equipment, which may reduce the reliability and accuracy of fault diagnosis. We introduced an intelligent diagnosis system of substation equipment based on cloud platform, which was composed of intelligent sensors, diagnosis cloud platform, and substation central control station. Real-data collected by intelligent sensors were sent to the cloud platform. The intelligent electronic devices (IED) were the core components of the cloud platform. Based on the principles of task scheduling, the cloud platform was able to reasonably allocate resources, fuse preliminary fault diagnosis information, and implement collaborative fault diagnosis as well as distributed storage of the diagnosis result. The substation central control station can further confirm the fault by calling the advanced diagnostic methods and send out the alarm and maintenance signals. The condition monitoring of a 220 kV transformer, as an example, shows that, compared with the traditional substation diagnosis system, IED in the intelligent diagnosis system are spare reciprocally and this system can realize the state data parallel analysis owing to resource sharing on the cloud platform. Thus the diagnosis time is shortened by 40.11% and the reliability of the fault diagnosis is improved. © 2015, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPI.

IEEE/ACM Trans. Comput. BioL. Bioinf.,"Prediction of essential proteins which are crucial to an organism's survival is important for disease analysis and drug design, as well as the understanding of cellular life. The majority of prediction methods infer the possibility of proteins to be essential by using the network topology. However, these methods are limited to the completeness of available protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and depend on the network accuracy. To overcome these limitations, some computational methods have been proposed. However, seldom of them solve this problem by taking consideration of protein domains. In this work, we first analyze the correlation between the essentiality of proteins and their domain features based on data of 13 species. We find that the proteins containing more protein domain types which rarely occur in other proteins tend to be essential. Accordingly, we propose a new prediction method, named UDoNC, by combining the domain features of proteins with their topological properties in PPI network. In UDoNC, the essentiality of proteins is decided by the number and the frequency of their protein domain types, as well as the essentiality of their adjacent edges measured by edge clustering coefficient. The experimental results on S. cerevisiae data show that UDoNC outperforms other existing methods in terms of area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, UDoNC can also perform well in predicting essential proteins on data of E. coli. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",,,20151600757213,6853342.0,"Peng, Wei (1, 2); Wang, Jianxin (1); Cheng, Yingjiao (1); Lu, Yu (1); Wu, Fangxiang (3); Pan, Yi (4) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (2) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Division of Biomedical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon; SK; S7N 5A9, Canada (4) Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta; GA; 30302-4110, United States ",,"804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Escherichia coli - Forecasting - Topology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TCBB.2014.2338317,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,15455963,2,"March 1, 2015",English,Proteins,,51.0,276-288,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,,UDoNC: An algorithm for identifying essential proteins based on protein domains and protein-protein interaction networks,,Area Under the Curve (AUC) - Edge clustering coefficients - Essential proteins - Prediction methods - Protein domains - Protein-protein interaction networks - Protein-protein interactions - Topological properties,12,

"Proc. - Int. Conf. Inf. Sci.

The recurrence plot is a powerful and sensitive approach to quantify the nonlinear interaction of the two complex systems due to their coupling. As an example of typical data sets where the recurrence based methods have proven powerful, we apply two modern nonlinear approaches, including cross-recurrence plot and line of synchronization, to analyze the phase asynchrony between coronal index and sunspot numbers during the time interval from January 1939 to December 2008. It is found that, (1) the average value of their phase lags is about -10 months, implying that coronal index lags behind sunspot numbers during the considered time interval, (2) their phase relationship is not a simply linear relation, although they are highly correlated with each other. Our analysis results indicate that modern nonlinear approaches for the phase analysis between different time series are fairly useful and powerful. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20153201154661,7120732.0,"Deng, Linhua (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Yunnan Observtories, Chinese Academy of Science, Kunming; 650011, China (2) Key Laboratory of Astronomical Optics and Technology, Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Nanjing; 210042, China (3) University of Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing; 100049, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 921 Mathematics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science,112892.0,"April 24, 2015 - April 26, 2015","Shanghai, China","2015 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2015",Data processing - Dynamical systems - Dynamics - Nonlinear analysis - Nonlinear dynamical systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Deng, Linhua(bench@ynao.ac.cn) ",10.1109/ICISCE.2015.192,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467368506.0,,,"June 9, 2015",English,Time series analysis,"Proceedings - 2015 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2015",30.0,843-847,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2015 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2015",China Jiliang University; et al.; Tongji University; University of Hull; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Xiamen University,Nonlinear dynamics recognition in solar time series based on recurrence plot techniques,,Cross recurrences - Fundamental properties - Highly-correlated - Linear relation - Nonlinear approach - Nonlinear interactions - Phase relationships - Recurrence plot,,

The effects of setting angle, medium flow and air inlet mode on solar air collector performance are analyzed, and the theory calculation model of it is confirmed by experimentation. The results show that the error between the theory calculation model and the experiment test maintains at around 9%. The results of calculation and analysis on thermal performance of this collector through theory calculation model indicate that setting angle has no influence on the thermal efficiency, while medium flow has a positive relation with it. In addition, heat-collecting efficiency can be improved by the negative pressure in the collector, but it is dropped along with the pressure going up. In sum, the fin plat solar air collector can be widely applied because it can be the medium-low temperature heat source for the solar drying systems. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,Open Access,20164603022516,,"Chang, Wei (1); Wang, Yunfeng (2); Li, Ming (2); Luo, Xi (2); Ruan, Yongbao (1); Hong, Yongrui (1); Zhang, Shaobo (1) ","(1) School of Physics and Electronic Information Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Solar Energy Research Institute, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,641.1 Thermodynamics - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 913.1 Production Engineering,79778099.0,"October 13, 2014 - October 15, 2014","Beijing, China","3rd International Conference on Solar Heating and Cooling for Buildings and Industry, SHC 2014",Efficiency - Solar heating - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Ming(liming@ynnu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.egypro.2015.02.092,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: U1137605, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: IRT0979, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: :2011DFA60460, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The present supported by National Natural Science Foundation,China(Grant No.:U1137605),the Program of Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in Ministry of Education,China(Grant No.:IRT0979), and the National and international scientific and technological Cooperation projects,China(Grant No.:2011DFA60460).",,18766102,,2015,English,Collector efficiency,,16.0,13-22,1of1,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Energy Procedia,,The Theoretical and Experimental Research on Thermal Performance of Solar Air Collector with Finned Absorber,,Collecting efficiency - Experimental research - Low temperature heat sources - Solar air collector - Solar drying systems - Theory calculation - thermal character - Thermal Performance,70,"Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Solar Heating and Cooling for Buildings and Industry, SHC 2014"
Neiranji Gongcheng,"In order to analyze the impact of thermal stress, bolt preload, firing pressure and piston side force on cylinder liner deformation, a coupled assembly model of engine block, cylinder head, cylinder liner and other related components of a four-cylinder engine was established. The results show that the expansion and compression deformation of the first and forth liners are larger than the other two liners. The law of liner deformation is similar in different loading cases and thermal deformation is dominated. On the base of given thermal load, bolt preload and firing pressure have greater impact on the maximum overall deformation of cylinder liner and piston side force has smaller impact on the maximum overall deformation of cylinder liner. Meanwhile, piston side force has greater impact on the distribution of the maximum radial deformation of cylinder liner, but has smaller impact on engine block and the main stress and deformation of cylinder liner. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Internal Combustion Engines.

For the in vitro antioxidant activities, RVLWP and RVLAP exhibited potent 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (IC50= 1.55 ± 0.04 and 3.37 ± 0.21 mg/mL, respectively), hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity (IC50= 6.07 ± 0.24 and 9.23 ± 0.54 mg/mL, respectively), lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect (IC50= 0.52 ± 0.095 and 0.86 ± 0.043 mg/mL, respectively), and moderate reducing power and Fe2+chelating activity (IC50= 1.86 ± 0.0036 and 0.22 ± 0.0057 mg/mL, respectively). Ascorbic acid was employed as the standard antioxidant in the present study. For the in vivo hepatoprotective activity, administration of RVLWP and RVLAP (200 mg/kg) significantly prevented the elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities in acute liver damage induced by CCl4and suppressed hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. Mice treated with RVLWP and RVLAP demonstrated a better profile of antioxidants with augmented activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the liver.

J. Polym. Environ.,"In this study, poly(l-lactide) (PLA) films were fabricated by melt processing and the plasticizing effect of hexadecyl lactate (HL) (0, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 wt% on PLA were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, tensile, transparency, and water vapor permeability tests. The SEM analysis revealed that PLA with 10 wt% HL appeared uniform with extra small bumps, confirmed the interaction between PLA and HL. The thermal analysis revealed a glass transition temperature of 57.4 °C for neat PLA film, but the addition of HL elicited a decrease in the temperature of the peak (43.8 °C). The incorporation of plasticizer into PLA resulted in the increase of elongation at break, as well as the decrease of tensile strength and tensile modulus. Even though a decrease in transparency was recorded, the PLA/HL blend films appeared transparent by visually observation. The water vapor permeability of PLA/HL blend films increased with the increase of HL. The PLA/HL blend films could effectively extend the shelf-life of fresh-cut pears as the commercial low density polyethylene films.

Opt. Express,"Unambiguous identification of low concentration chemical mixtures can be performed by broadband enhanced infrared absorption (BEIRA). Here we propose and numerically study a corrugated parallel plate waveguide (CPPW) with gradient grooves which is capable of directly converting transmission modes to surface plasmon modes and could hence serve as a powerful chemical sensor. Such a waveguide can be designed to exhibit a wide pass band covering an extended portion of a molecule absorption spectrum. Broadband sensing of toluene and ethanol thin layers is demonstrated by calculating the transmission coefficient of the waveguide and is shown to correspond exactly to their infrared spectra. In addition, the upper limit and the lower limit of the bandgap are mainly dependent on the minimum and maximum groove height, respectively, which provide an effective way of tuning the working frequency of the device in order to support surface plasmon modes within a desired frequency range according to a specific application. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,,20151700776120,,"Yang, Jingjing (1); Francescato, Yan (2); Chen, Dezhang (1); Yang, Jianfeng (1); Huang, Ming (1) ","(1) Wireless Innovation Lab of Yunnan University, School of Information Science and Engineering, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London, London; SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom ",,714.3 Waveguides - 741.1 Light/Optics,,,,,Absorption spectroscopy - Light absorption - Surface plasmons,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1364/OE.23.008583,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10944087,,,,,7,"April 6, 2015",English,Waveguides,,25.0,8583-8589,,2015,Optical Society of America (OSA),Optics Express,,Broadband molecular sensing with a tapered spoof plasmon waveguide,,Chemical mixtures - Infrared spectrum - Low concentrations - Parallel plate waveguide - Plasmon waveguide - Surface plasmon modes - Transmission coefficients - Working frequency,23,
Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"In order to solve the problem that single-ended traveling wave fault location is hard to implement automatically and reliably, because of the difficulties in wavefront detection, based on historical data, an experiential learning improvement method via multi-stage case-based reasoning was proposed in this paper. The characteristics of actual fault induced traveling wave currents and the factors affecting the converted fault distance were analyzed at first. According to the feature of similarity and repetition of the faults induced traveling waveshapes, the parameterized cases of wavefront detection and converted coefficient were described separately, and then intelligent fault location was performed reusing the most similar known cases key parameters by searching the nearest neighborhood historical cases in each feature space. The proposed method is capable of reusing the final conclusions for repetitive faults, and reusing the solving methods for the cases which are similar with historical cases. The performance of the fault location increases gradually with the accumulation of actual fault samples. The proposed method is proved feasible and effective by actual datasets captured by travelling wave fault location devices of different manufacturers. ©2015 Chin. Soc. for Elec.

Nanotechnology,"We discuss the SiGe island co-sputtering deposition on a microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si) buffer layer and the secondary island growth based on this pre-SiGe island layer. The growth phenomenon of SiGe islands on crystalline silicon (c-Si) is also investigated for comparison. The pre-SiGe layer grown on μc-Si exhibits a mixed-phase structure, including SiGe islands and amorphous SiGe (a-SiGe) alloy, while the layer deposited on c-Si shows a single-phase island structure. The preferential growth and Ostwald ripening growth are shown to be the secondary growth mechanism of SiGe islands on μc-Si and c-Si, respectively. This difference may result from the effect of amorphous phase Si (AP-Si) in μc-Si on the island growth. In addition, the Si-Ge intermixing behavior of the secondary-grown islands on μc-Si is interpreted by constructing the model of lateral atomic migration, while this behavior on c-Si is ascribed to traditional uphill atomic diffusion. It is found that the aspect ratios of the preferential-grown super islands are higher than those of the Ostwald-ripening ones. The lower lateral growth rate of super islands due to the lower surface energy of AP-Si on the μc-Si buffer layer for the non-wetting of Ge at 700 °C and the stronger Si-Ge intermixing effect at 730 °C may be responsible for this aspect ratio difference. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,20154201413820,445602.0,"Ke, S.Y.

Geotecton. Metallog.,"The Tengchong block located in the conjunction of West Yunnan composite orogenic belt and southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and the granites in the block are important way to explore its tectonic evolution. U-Pb dating of zircon from the monzogranites in Lailishan at Tengchong county yields an age of 50.4±0.4 Ma, indicating that the pluton is related to the Early Cenozoic Indian-Eurasian continental collision. The Lailishan granites are characterized by high-K calc-alkaline and metaluminous, with SiO2=67.52%-68.99%, K2O=5.13%-5.70%, Al2O3=14.03%-14.98%, K2O/Na2O=1.66-1.89, A/CNK=0.95-0.99, A/NK=1.32-1.40. The rocks have high FeOT/MgO (4.03-4.54) and 10000×Ga/Al (5.18-5.59) ratios, enrich in Rb, Th, U, K, Pb (LILE) and Zr, Hf (HFSE), but deplete in Ba, Nb, Sr, P, Ti, Eu, and right oblique REE type. All these characteristics suggest that the Lailishan granites are A-type granite and belonging to A2 sub-type. The ΕHf(t) values ( -11.44- -8.01) and the two-stage model ages (tHf2) (1.63-1.85 Ga) of the Lailishan granites suggest that the granites were mainly derived from remelting of the thickened Mesoproterozoic continental crust. At the Early Eocene, around 50 Ma, the Tengchong-Lianghe area in West Yunnan was not in post-orogenic environment that traditionally represented by A2 type granites, but just in the transition tectonic setting of Indian-Eurasian plate from syn-collision to post-collision, revealing a geodynamic processe of enduring from extrusive mechanism to tensive mechanism in this area. Therefore, we consider that southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau are in the syn-collision tectonic setting since the peak of Indian-Eurasian continental collision to the Early Eocene, following in the short-lived relaxation of post-collision setting, then the Lailishan A-type Granites was formed in the Tengliang area of Western Yunnan. © 2015, Science Press.

Int. J. Comput. Intell. Syst.,"Abstract: Rule acquisition is one of the main purposes in the analysis of decision formal contexts. In general, the number of implications in a decision formal context is an exponential increase to the scale of the database. So, it is important to introduce effective inference rules between implications for eliminating as many superfluous implications as possible. This study puts forward a criterion called ‘strongness’ to assess the effectiveness of inference rules in terms of eliminating superfluous implications. We define a new inference rule in decision formal contexts and prove that the proposed inference rule is stronger than the existing one. Furthermore, we figure out the exact number of the superfluous implications that we can additionally remove by using the proposed inference rule compared with the existing one. © 2015, the authors.",,Open Access,20144600179204,,"Li, Jinhai (1); Mei, Changlin (2); Wang, Lidong (3); Wang, Junhong (4) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) School of Mathematics and Statistics, XiXi’anan Jiaotong University, XiXi’anan, Shaanxi; 710049, China (3) Department of Mathematics, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning; 116026, China (4) School of Computer and Information Technology, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi; 030006, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis,,,,,Information analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Jinhai ",10.1080/18756891.2014.967009,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18756883,,,,18756891,1,"January 2, 2015",English,Formal concept analysis,,54.0,175-186,,2015,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems,,On inference rules in decision formal contexts,,Concept Lattices - Exponential increase - Formal contexts - Inference rules - Rule acquisition,8,
ISRM Int. Congr. Rock Mech.,"In order to research temperature field for construction of connecting passage in Metro using artificial freezing method, the finite difference software FLAC3Dis employed to numerically simulate construction process of connecting passage. During construction, the overall distribution of temperature field around connecting passage, the relationship between soil temperature and freezing time, the distribution and variation for the thickness of freezing wall are studied from the perspective of numerical analysis. The results show as follows: after 55 days' freezing, the soil temperature surrounding connecting passage is about-24°C ∼ -28°C, and the minimum thickness of freezing wall is about 4.0m, which is larger than the design value 3.1m. So construction conditions have satisfied to the excavation of connecting passage and pumping station. During the excavation of connecting passage, soil temperature has almost no obvious change and the thickness of freezing wall remains constant mainly. After 45 days' normal thawing, the temperature of freezing wall rises 12°C approximately. And the soil temperature rises faster at the beginning of the normal thawing stage. In the whole process of construction, the frozen area is about 5m outside the edge of connecting passage, and the cooling area is about 10m outside the edge of connecting passage. © 2015 by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy & Petroleum and ISRM.",,,20181204932690,,"Wang, Zhi-Liang (1); Shen, Lin-Fang (1); Xie, Jian-Bin (2) ","(1) Faculty of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) School of Urban Construction and Management, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,433.2 Passenger Railroad Transportation - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 723.5 Computer Applications - 921.6 Numerical Methods,133167.0,"May 10, 2015 - May 13, 2015","Montreal, QC, Canada",13th ISRM International Congress of Rock Mechanics 2015,Computer simulation - Excavation - Numerical analysis - Numerical methods - Rock mechanics - Soils - Subways - Temperature - Temperature distribution - Thawing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Zhi-Liang(wangzhiliangtj@126.com) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 51408284, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No.51408284), and the Personnel Training Fund of Kunming University of Science and Technology (grant No. KKSY201206020).",9781926872254.0,,,2015,English,Freezing,13th ISRM International Congress of Rock Mechanics,8.0,1-7,1 of 1,2015,International Society for Rock Mechanics,13th ISRM International Congress of Rock Mechanics,,3D numerical analyses of temperature field for construction of connecting passage in metro using artificial freezing method,,3-D numerical analysis - Connecting passage - Construction process - Distribution of temperature - Freezing methods - Minimum thickness - Pumping stations - Soil temperature,2015- MAY,

Food Sci. Technol. Res.,"This study investigated the antioxidative and antiglycative abilities of flesh and peel extracts of Chinese purple yam. Among five fractions of purple yam extracts, the ethyl acetate (EA) fraction exerted the best antioxidant activity. Peel (P-EA) and flesh EA extracts (F-EA) exhibited excellent antiglycation ability by efficiently suppressing different stages of the glycation cascade, and the effect was mainly due to their antioxidant activities. The cytoprotective effect of F-EA and P-EA on methylglyoxal induced oxidative damage in HepG2 cells was also determined, and the underlying mechanism was the strengthened antioxidant defense system in HepG2 cells. Peel extract exerted better bioactivity than flesh extract, which indicated that purple yam peel, a kind of kitchen waste that is always overlooked, might serve as a promising therapeutic natural product for the prevention of diabetes or other advanced glycation end products-related diseases.

Solid State Commun,"We have investigated the martensitic transformation, exchange bias, magnetoresistance (MR) and strain in Ni50-xFexMn36Sn14(x=1, 2, 3, 4) Heusler alloys. With the increase of Fe content, the austenite phase could be stabilized with L21structure and hence the martensitic transition shifts to a lower temperature and finally disappears. This behavior can be understood by the weakening of Ni-Mn hybridization to suppress AFM interactions and enhancement of Fe-Fe ferromagnetic exchange interactions. The same reason can account for the slight decrease of exchange bias field (HEB) with the increase of the Fe content from x=1 to 2 and the disappearance of HEBfor x=3. We observed MR effect for x=3, and a maximum MR value of -52% was achieved, which can be explained by the change in the electronic structure during martensitic transformation induced by the magnetic field. In addition, a large strain of 0.207% in Ni49Fe1Mn36Sn14was observed due to the changes of lattice parameters during the martensitic transformation induced by temperature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The incorporation of the orbitals of Dy3+in the formation of the discrete level associated with oxygen vacancy (Vo..) causes a change in the number of traps, which largely extends the thermoluminescence characteristics and evidently improves the long persistent luminescence property of the phosphor. Both fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra of Li2SrSiO4:Eu2+, Dy3+reveal broad and intensive emission extending from 500 to 700nm with a peak at about 567nm, this indicates that photoluminescence(PL) and long-lasting luminescence (LLL) are from the same Eu2+ions center.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Inf. Autom., ICIA - conjunction IEEE Int. Conf. Autom. Logist.","Feature extraction of faulty rolling element bearings (REBs) is important in condition monitoring and faults diagnosis of rotating machinery. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a useful tool for non-stationary signal analysis, by which the analyzed vibration generated by the faulty REBs can be decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). However, how to determine an interesting intrinsic mode function (IMF) is often difficult in the applications of EMD. To address this issue, a kurtosis based scheme for the feature extraction of faulty REBs has been introduced in this paper. In the scheme, the vibration generated by REBs is acquired firstly. Then, the EMD is performed to decompose the vibration into a set of IMFs. Lastly, the kurtosis is calculated to determine the interesting IMF, which has the maximum kurtosis value.

Mater. Trans.,"Based on its structural features, Aluminum Foam Sandwich (AFS) panels were properly simplified to two-dimensional random models through C++ and ANSYS software in this paper. The apparent elastic property of AFS panels was studied through simulation under the circumstances of different relative density, pore size range or geometric imperfections. The obtained results showed that the microstructural deformation in AFS was caused during uniaxial compression, which leaded to the increase of apparent elastic modulus with the increase of relative density. It was also found that the apparent elastic modulus of AFS panels with non-homogeneous structure was the highest and the apparent elastic modulus of AFS panels with geometric imperfections was the lowest. Moreover, the pore size range almost had no effect on the slope of the elastic stage. However, the apparent elastic modulus showed great sensitivity to the geometric imperfections. In addition, the exponential relationship between the relative densities and the relative elastic modulus was fitted. The simulation results in this work were in agreement with those found in previous theoretical and experimental results reported in other literature, which confirmed the feasibility and rationality of two-dimensional random models. © 2015 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.",,Open Access,20151800801273,,"Qiu, Sawei (1); Zhang, Xinna (2); Hao, Qingxian (1); Dou, Renjun (1); Ju, Yan (1); Hu, Yuebo (1) ","(1) Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming ,Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Faculty of Automation and Electric Power, Kunming Metallurgy College, Kunming; 650033, China ",MTARCE,"408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 541.1 Aluminum - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.1.1 Computer Programming Languages - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Aluminum - C++ (programming language) - Elastic moduli - Elasticity - Geometry - Honeycomb structures - Pore size - Sandwich structures,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Hu, Yuebo(huyb@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.2320/matertrans.M2015008,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,13459678,5,2015,English,Computer software,,20.0,687-690,,2015,Japan Institute of Metals (JIM),Materials Transactions,,Simulation of apparent elastic property in the two-dimensional model of aluminum foam sandwich panels,,Aluminum foam sandwich panels - Apparent elastic modulus - Geometric imperfection - Microstructural deformation - Random Model - Simulation - Two dimensional model - Uni-axial compression,56,

Opt Commun,"This paper studies the propagation properties of controllable hollow flat-topped beams (CHFBs) in turbulent atmosphere based on ABCD matrix, sets up a propagation model and obtains an analytical expression for the propagation. With the help of numerical simulation, the propagation properties of CHFBs in different parameters are studied. Results indicate that in turbulent atmosphere, with the increase of propagation distance, the darkness of CHFBs gradually annihilate, and eventually evolve into Gaussian beams. Compared with the propagation properties in free space, the turbulent atmosphere enhances the diffraction effect of CHFBs and reduces the propagation distance for CHFBs to evolve into Gaussian beams. In strong turbulence atmospheric propagation, Airy disk phenomenon will disappear. The study on the propagation properties of CHFBs in turbulence atmosphere by using ABCD matrix is simple and convenient. This method can also be applied to study the propagation properties of other hollow laser beams in turbulent atmosphere. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20144200107670,,"Liu, Huilong (1); Lü, Yanfei (1); Zhang, Jing (2); Xia, Jing (1); Pu, Xiaoyun (1); Dong, Yuan (2); Li, Shutao (2); Fu, Xihong (3); Zhang, Angfeng (4); Wang, Changjia (2); Tan, Yong (2); Zhang, Xihe (2) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Science, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun; 130022, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Luminescence and Applications, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun; 130033, China (4) Laboratory of Info-integration Technology, Xian Institute of Applied Optics, Xian; 710065, China ",OPCOB8,"443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.1 Light/Optics - 744.1 Lasers, General - 744.8 Laser Beam Interactions",,,,,Atmospheric turbulence - Diffraction - Gaussian beams - Laser beams - Laser theory,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lü, Yanfei ",10.1016/j.optcom.2014.08.029,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 61475026, Acronym: -, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 61108029, 61275135 and 61475026 ).",,00304018,,"January 15, 2015",English,Light propagation,,33.0,133-140,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Optics Communications,,Research on propagation properties of controllable hollow flat-topped beams in turbulent atmosphere based on ABCD matrix,,Analytical expressions - Atmospheric propagation - Diffraction theory - Hollow beams - Propagation distances - Propagation modeling - Propagation properties - Turbulent atmosphere,334,
For. Ecol. Manage.,"Early stages of post-fire regeneration are sensitive to various factors, and can provide critical information for understanding forest responses to fire disturbance and projecting subsequent forest dynamics. Yunnan pine forests are the most widespread conifer forest type in Southwest China, and are frequently threatened by fire disturbance. Post-fire regeneration of this forest type, however, has not been previously studied. In this study, we investigated the early post-fire regeneration in mixed Yunnan pine forests five months after a severe burn in 2013 on Mt. Qinglongling, Yunnan Province, China. We found very active post-fire regeneration in the burned area likely facilitated by ample summer rainfall, with an average regeneration density of ∼105stems ha−1. Species composition of the post-fire regeneration was highly similar to the pre-fire community–the similarity between the pre- and post-fire communities was 0.530 ± 0.222. Elevation, pre-fire community type, and slope position were the three primary factors in the variations in regeneration density and species composition, while the impact of fire severity was low. The regeneration density of Pinus species and evergreen broadleaf species showed contrasting patterns across the environmental gradients, and the results implied that Yunnan forests are generally resilient to fire disturbance. The controlling impacts of the pre-fire community on post-fire regeneration are driven by the efficient regenerating strategies of dominant species, and are a comprehensive reflection of habitat conditions, which are primarily mediated by topographic features. Species regeneration strategies and the high resilience of the community to fire disturbance should be taken into account in fire prevention and management approaches for this forest type. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20181304939254,,"Han, Jie (1); Shen, Zehao (1); Ying, Lingxiao (1); Li, Guixiang (2); Chen, Anping (3) ","(1) Department of Ecology, College of Urban & Environmental Sciences, The Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education on Earth Surface Processes, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Institute of Forestry, Yunnan Academy of Forestry Sciences, Kunming; Yunnan; 650204, China (3) Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton; NJ; 08544-2016, United States ",FECMDW,443.3 Precipitation - 914.2 Fires and Fire Protection - 951 Materials Science - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Decision trees - Deforestation - Fireproofing - Rain - Reforestation - Topography,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Shen, Zehao(shzh@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.016,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 41371190, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31321061, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 41371190, 31321061).

Talanta,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases or type II diabetes. Till now, the etiology of MetS is complex and still unknown. Metabolic profiling is a powerful tool for exploring metabolic perturbations and potential biomarkers, thus may shed light on the pathophysiological mechanism of diseases. In this study, fatty acid profiling was employed to exploit the metabolic disturbances and discover potential biomarkers of MetS. Fatty acid profiles of serum samples from metabolic syndrome patients and healthy controls were first analyzed by gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring-mass spectrometry (GC-SIM-MS), a robust method for quantitation of fatty acids. Then, the supervised multivariate statistical method of random forests (RF) was used to establish a classification and prediction model for MetS, which could assist the diagnosis of MetS. Furthermore, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was employed to investigate the relationships between free fatty acids (FFAs) and clinical parameters. As a result, several FFAs, including C16:1n-9c, C20:1n-9c and C22:4n-6c, were identified as potential biomarkers of MetS. The results also indicated that high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were the most important parameters which were closely correlated with FFAs disturbances of MetS, thus they should be paid more attention in clinical practice for monitoring FFAs disturbances of MetS than waist circumference (WC) and systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP). The results have demonstrated that metabolic profiling by GC-SIM-MS combined with RF and CCA may be a useful tool for discovering the perturbations of serum FFAs and possible biomarkers for MetS. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Rengong Jingti Xuebao,"Titania powders and 5mol% Ce-doped TiO2 powders were synthesized by sol-gel method. The influence of Ce dopant on the phase transformation temperature, phase compositions, chemical states and the visible light absorbable range of titania were investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-Vis). The results show that Ce dopant inhibits the phase transformation and grain growth of titania. As the heat treatment temperature of Ce-doped titania increases, lattice oxygen peak is enhanced, while absorption oxygen peak is reduced. Meanwhile, Ti2p3/2 binding energy is decreased, and Ce3+ was gradually oxidized to Ce4+. In addition, the Ce-doped increases the visible light absorbable range of titania. ©, 2015, Chinese Ceramic Society.

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"Both Bacteria and Archaea might be involved in various biogeochemical processes in lacustrine sediment ecosystems. However, the factors governing the intra-lake distribution of sediment bacterial and archaeal communities in various freshwater lakes remain unclear. The present study investigated the sediment bacterial and archaeal communities in 13 freshwater lakes on the Yunnan Plateau. Quantitative PCR assay showed a large variation in bacterial and archaeal abundances. Illumina MiSeq sequencing illustrated high bacterial and archaeal diversities. Bacterial abundance was regulated by sediment total organic carbon and total nitrogen, and water depth, while nitrate nitrogen was an important determinant of bacterial diversity. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia were the major components of sediment bacterial communities. Proteobacteria was the largest phylum, but its major classes and their proportions varied greatly among different lakes, affected by sediment nitrate nitrogen. In addition, both Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota were important members in sediment archaeal communities, while unclassified Archaea usually showed the dominance. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20144900283375,,"Zhang, Jingxu (1); Yang, Yuyin (1); Zhao, Lei (2); Li, Yuzhao (3); Xie, Shuguang (1); Liu, Yong (3) ","(1) State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China (3) Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (Ministry of Education), College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China ",AMBIDG,483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Bacteria - Lakes - Nitrates - Nitrogen - Organic carbon - Polymerase chain reaction - Water,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xie, Shuguang ",10.1007/s00253-014-6262-x,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320614,,,,01757598,7,2015,English,Sediments,,65.0,3291-3302,,2015,Springer Verlag,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,,Distribution of sediment bacterial and archaeal communities in plateau freshwater lakes,,Archaea - High-throughput sequencing - Lake sediments - Microbial biomass - Microbial community structures - Microbial diversity,99,
J Opt Soc Am A,"A novel 3-D filtering method is presented for speckle reduction and detail preservation in automated 3-D ultrasound images. First, texture features of an image are analyzed by using the improved quadtree (QT) decomposition. Then, the optimal homogeneous and the obvious heterogeneous regions are selected from QT decomposition results. Finally, diffusion parameters and diffusion process are automatically decided based on the properties of these two selected regions. The computing time needed for 2-D speckle reduction is very short. However, the computing time required for 3-D speckle reduction is often hundreds of times longer than 2-D speckle reduction. This may limit its potential application in practice. Because this new filter can adaptively adjust the time step of iteration, the computation time is reduced effectively. Both synthetic and real 3-D ultrasound images are used to evaluate the proposed filter. It is shown that this filter is superior to other methods in both practicality and efficiency. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,,20163402728945,,"Wu, Jun (1, 2); Wang, Yuanyuan (1, 3); Yu, Jinhua (1); Shi, Xinling (2); Zhang, Junhua (2); Chen, Yue (4); Pang, Yun (4) ","(1) Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China (2) Department of Electronic Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (3) Key Lab of Medical Imaging Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention of Shanghai, Shanghai, China (4) Department of Ultrasound, Huadong Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China ",JOAOD6,741.1 Light/Optics - 753.1 Ultrasonic Waves - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Diffusion - Iterative methods - Speckle - Ultrasonics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yuanyuan(yywang@fudan.edu.cn) ",10.1364/JOSAA.32.000248,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15208532,"Number: 6127107111474071, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2015CB755500), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (61271071, 11474071).",,10847529,2,2015,English,Image enhancement,,27.0,248-257,,2015,OSA - The Optical Society,"Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision",,Intelligent speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion algorithm for automated 3-D ultrasound images,,Computation time - Detail preservation - Diffusion parameters - Diffusion process - Heterogeneous region - Speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion - Speckle reduction - Texture features,32,
Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"The silicon-rich SiNxfilms were fabricated on Si(100) substrate and quartz substrate at different substrate temperatures varying from room temperature to 400 by bipolar pulse ane RF magnetron co-sputtering deposition technique. After deposition, the films were annealed in a nitrogen atmosphere by rapid photo-thermal annealing at 1 050 for 3 minutes. This thermal step allows the formation of the silicon quantum dots. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to analyze the bonding configurations, microstructures and luminescence properties of the films. The experimental results showed that: silicon-rich Si-N bonds were found in Fourier transform infrared spectra, suggesting that the silicon-rich SiNxfilms were successfully prepared; when the substrate temperature was not lower than 200, the Raman spectra of the films showed the transverse optical mode of Si-Si vibration, while the significant diffraction peaks of Si(111) and Si(311) were shown in grazing incidence X-ray diffraction spectra, confirming the formation of silicon quantum dots; our work indicated that there was an optimal substrate temperature (300), which could significantly increase the amount and the crystalline volume fraction of silicon quantum dots; three visible photoluminescence bands can be obtained for both 300 sample and 400 sample, and in combination with Raman results, the emission peaks were reasonably explained by using the quantum confinement effect and radiative recombination defect state of Si nanocrystals; the average size of the silicon quantum dots is 3.5 and 3.4 nm for the 300 sample and 400 sample, respectively. These results are useful for optimizing the fabrication parameters of silicon quantum dots embedded in SiNxthin films and have valuable implications for silicon based photoelectric device applications. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Anal. Chim. Acta,"Bioactive component identification is a crucial issue in search for new drug leads. We provide a new strategy to search for bioactive components based on Sure Independence Screening (SIS) and interval PLS (iPLS). The method, which is termed as SIS-iPLS, is not only able to find out the chief bioactive components, but also able to judge how many components should be there responsible for the total bioactivity. The method is totally 'data-driven' with no need for prior knowledge about the unknown mixture analyzed, therefore especially suitable for effect-directed work like bioassay-guided fractionation. Two data sets, a synthetic mixture system of twelve components and a suite of Radix Puerariae Lobatae extracts samples, are used to test the identification ability of the SIS-iPLS method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20151200669768,,"Xu, Jian (1); Xu, Qing-Song (1); Chan, Chi-On (2, 3); Mok, Daniel Kam-Wah (2, 3); Yi, Lun-Zhao (4); Chau, Foo-Tim (2, 3) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (2) Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, SAR Hong Kong, Hong Kong (3) State Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, Shenzhen, China (4) Yunnan Food Safety Research Institute, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",ACACAM,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Diagnosis - Least squares approximations - Mixtures,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Qing-Song ",10.1016/j.aca.2015.02.030,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734324,"Number: 11271374, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",This work is financially supported by the National Nature Foundation Committee of PR China (Grants Nos. 11271374 and 21105129 ).

Ore Geol. Rev.,"The Beiya gold-polymetallic orefield, with gold reserves of 305t, is one of the most representative porphyry-skarn orefields in the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan Cu-Au ore belt within the Sanjiang region of southwest China. The orefield contains seven deposits: the Wandongshan, Hongnitang, Dashadi, Bijiashan, Weiganpo, Matouwan, and Bailiancun deposits. In this paper we report on the geochemistry and geochronology of porphyries associated with mineralization from the seven deposits. The results show that all the porphyries have similar geochemistry, with high alkalinity, high contents of SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, and Sr, high K2O/Na2O ratios, low MgO, Y, and Yb contents, enrichments in Ba, K, and Pb, depletions in P, Ti, Nb, and Ta, and non-evident to weak Eu depletions (δEu=0.42-0.99). In the SiO2vs. Th/Ce diagram, the porphyry samples are distributed in the area of thickened lower crust, and in the Sr/Y vs. Y and La/Yb vs. Yb diagrams, the porphyries broadly followed the batch-melting trend of amphibolite containing up to 10% garnet. LA-MC-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating analysis suggests that the porphyries were emplaced between 34.62±0.25 and 36.72±0.25Ma. They were coeval with lamprophyres (34 to 36Ma) in the Beiya area and with potassic-ultrapotassic intrusive rocks (40 to 35Ma) within the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan magmatic belt, indicating possible genetic relation between these rock types. We suggest that the porphyries in the Beiya gold-polymetallic orefield were derived from the partial melting of a K-rich mafic source in the thickened lower crust, with the melting triggered by asthenospheric upwelling following the removal of lower lithospheric mantle. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20152200888310,,"Liu, Bo (1, 2); Liu, Huan (1); Zhang, Changqing (1); Mao, Zhihao (3); Zhou, Yunman (4); Huang, Hua (3); He, Zhonghua (4); Su, Gangsheng (4) ","(1) MLR Key Laboratory of Metallogeny and Mineral Assessment, Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing; 100037, China (2) National Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Information and Image Analysis Technology, Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology, Beijing; 100029, China (3) School of Earth Science and Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing; 100083, China (4) Yunnan Gold and Mineral Group Co., Ltd, Kunming; 650224, China ",,481 Geology and Geophysics - 482.2 Minerals - 482.2.1 Gems - 544.2 Copper Alloys - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 547.2 Rare Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Binary alloys - Cerium compounds - Copper alloys - Deposits - Europium compounds - Geochemistry - Geochronology - Gold alloys - Lead alloys - Magnesia - Melting - Silica - Silicate minerals - Thorium compounds - Ytterbium - Zircon,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Huan ",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2015.03.004,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,01691368,,"September 1, 2015",English,Gold deposits,,107.0,360-379,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Ore Geology Reviews,,"Geochemistry and geochronology of porphyries from the Beiya gold-polymetallic orefield, western Yunnan, China",,Beiya - Genetic relations - Intrusive rocks - Lithospheric mantle - Partial melting - Potassic porphyry - Southwest China - Zircon U-Pb dating,69,

However, traditional optimization methods cannot meet the requirements of engineering design due to insufficient rationality and scientificity. The network optimization algorithm has obvious advantages in speed and reliability while solving the above problems. This paper studies Genetic Algorithm-based (GA-based) network optimization by constructing a simulation model of an all-terminal network. Experimental results show that GA could provide a set of deployment solutions that meet the actual engineering needs with the lowest network investment.

ACS Nano,"The electronic-mechanical coupling in semiconductor nanostructures under different strain loading modes can modulate their photoelectric properties in different manners. Here, we report the systematic investigation on the strain mode dependent bandgap deformation potential of ZnO micro/nanowires under both uniaxial tensile and bending strains at room temperature. Uniaxial stretching-photoluminescence results show that the deformation potential of the smaller ZnO nanowire (with diameter d = 260 nm) is -30.6 meV/%, and is close to the bulk value, whereas it deviates the bulk value and becomes to be -10.6 meV/% when the wire diameter is increased to d = 2 μm. This unconventional size dependence stems from surface effect induced inhomogeneous strain in the surface layer and the core of the ZnO micro/nanowires under uniaxial tension. For bending load mode, the in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscope analysis reveals that the local strain distributes linearly in the bending cross section. Further cathodoluminescence measurements on a bending ZnO microwire (d = 1.8 μm) demonstrate that the deformation potential is -27 meV/%, whose absolute value is much larger than that of the ZnO microwire under uniaxial tension. Further analysis reveals that the distinct deformation potentials originate from the different deforming modes in ZnO micro/nanowires under bending or uniaxial tensile strains.

J Opt Soc Am A,"In this paper, a linear calibration method is proposed for a paracatadioptric camera using the images of two spheres. Two spheres are selected in space, and the two groups of their projection circles on the unit viewing sphere are made to intersect at four points. The quadrilateral consisting of four points is a rectangle, so a group of orthogonal directions can be determined in space to obtain a group of orthogonal vanishing points in the paracatadioptric image plane. Because of the relationship between orthogonal vanishing points and intrinsic camera parameters, the intrinsic parameters of a paracatadioptric camera can be linearly solved by at least five views satisfying the above conditions. First, one estimates the sphere images and their antipodal sphere images. Second, by solving the intersection of the images of two spheres and the intersection of the images of their antipodal spheres, a group of orthogonal vanishing points can be obtained in the image plane. Finally, by taking the relationship between the orthogonal vanishing points and the intrinsic camera parameters as constraint conditions, the intrinsic parameters of the paracatadioptric camera can be obtained. Simulation results and real image data demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithms. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,,20161002051347,,"Zhao, Yue (1); Wang, Yalin (2) ","(1) Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Xi'an Research Institute of High-Tech Hongqing Town, Mathematics and or Section, Shanxi; 710025, China ",JOAOD6,716.4 Television Systems and Equipment,,,,,Video cameras,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Yue(zhao6685@yeah.net) ",10.1364/JOSAA.32.002201,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15208532,"Number: 11361074, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (11361074).,,10847529,11,"November 1, 2015",English,Spheres,,24.0,2201-2209,,2015,OSA - The Optical Society,"Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision",,Intrinsic parameter determination of a paracatadioptric camera by the intersection of two sphere projections,,Constraint conditions - Intrinsic camera parameters - Intrinsic parameters - Linear calibration - Orthogonal directions - Orthogonal vanishing points - Paracatadioptric - Paracatadioptric cameras,32,

RSC Adv.,"Ternary oxide Zn2SnO4was introduced to a rod-like nanostructured SnO2gas sensor for formaldehyde detection by a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis. The effects of the Zn2SnO4additive on the structure, morphology and gas-sensing property of SnO2were investigated in this study. It was confirmed that control of the Zn amounts in the precursor solution was effective in realizing well-developed one- and two-dimensional coexisting structured SnO2-Zn2SnO4(SnZn) nanocomposites. The gas sensing properties of the resulting SnZn composites to HCHO vapor were tested. The results showed that the presence of Zn2SnO4species in SnO2powders could effectively enhance electrical conductivity, reduce optimal operating temperature and improve the gas response of the sensors. The composite exhibited the highest response towards HCHO in the case of 35 at% Zn2SnO4nanoplates coupling with hierarchical branched structures of SnO2nanorods (SnZn35) at a relatively lower operating temperature of 162 °C. The good gas-sensing performance of the SnZn35composite can be ascribed to the smaller particle size, the larger surface area and the more absorbed Ox-species, which all are favorable for gas diffusion and sensing reactions. This work renders great potential in the fabrication of gas sensors using a binary-ternary oxide composite, which can be further applied in indoor pollution detection. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20152100858683,,"Xiao, Xuechun (1); Xing, Xinxin (1); Han, Bingqian (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Cai, Xiaoyan (1); Wang, Yude (1, 2) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Mico-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,641.1 Thermodynamics - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Binary alloys - Chemical detection - Chemical sensors - Formaldehyde - Gas sensing electrodes - Hydrothermal synthesis - Nanorods - Particle size - Temperature,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c5ra01887k,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,53,2015,English,Gas detectors,,40.0,42628-42636,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Enhanced formaldehyde sensing properties of SnO2nanorods coupled with Zn2SnO4,,Branched structures - Electrical conductivity - Formaldehyde detection - Formaldehyde-sensing - Gas sensing properties - Operating temperature - Precursor solutions - SnO2 gas sensors,5,

Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng,"The crystal structures, electronic structures and optical properties of pure and nonmetal (B,C,N,F,P,S and Cl) doping anatase TiO2were calculated by the first-principles based on the density functional theory with the plane-wave ultrasoft pesudopotentials method. The calculated results show that the octahedral dipole moments of TiO2are increased by nonmetal doping owing to the changes of lattice parameters, bond length and charges on atoms, which is very effective for the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. Because the impurity energy levels are formed by hybridizing with dopants' p states, O 2p states and Ti 3d states, most dopants could narrow the band gap, resulting in its fundamental absorption edge red-shift to visible-light region. According to the calculated results, the effects of nonmetal doping on electronic structure and optical properties of anatase TiO2were analyzed and compared, and the roles of nonmetal atoms in TiO2photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation were clarified. The calculated results could explain the reasons that some nonmetal-doped TiO2have higher photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation.

Heat Mass Transf.,"The interaction of multiple sourced fountains is very common in many applications such as computers and electronic instruments, discharge of waste water from power plants to marine environments, displacement ventilation and air conditioning of large building spaces. But the understanding of such an interaction is currently scarce. This paper is the first part of the study on the behavior of the interaction between twin transitional round fountains with equal power in a homogeneous fluid. In this paper, the interaction behavior is investigated experimentally using a noninvasive PIV technique and flow visualization over the ranges 25≤Re≤400 and 1≤Fr≤5 at the fixed spacing of D/X0=10, where Re and Fr are the Reynolds and Froude numbers, D is the spacing between the two fountain sources, andX0is the radius of orifices at the fountain source. The interaction behavior is observed to be dominated by bobbing and flapping motions and is either steady, or unsteady and weakly multi-modal or strongly multi-modal, depending on the specific values of Re and Fr. In a steady interaction, the bobbing-flapping motions are only present in its initial development stage and the interaction will attain a steady state in the later development stage in which the bobbing-flapping motions are no longer present and the maximum interaction height,zi, becomes constant. In an unsteady interaction, the interaction remains unsteady all the time and the bobbing-flapping motions are present at all development stages. The unsteady interaction is characterized by a finite number of discrete modes, with the time averagedziapproximately constant. Among all cases considered, the steady interaction behavior is observed for the cases of Re≤100 with all Fr values considered and of Fr≤1 with all Re values considered, except Re=400; the unsteady weakly multi-modal interaction behavior is observed for 150≤Re≤300 with 1.5≤Fr≤5 and Fr=1 with Re=400; and the unsteady strongly multi-modal interaction behavior is found for Re=400 with 1i, which is the time-averaged dimensionless maximum interaction height at full development, and Re and Fr, i.e., z¯i=0.194Fr7/4Re1/4over the ranges 25≤Re≤400 and 1≤Fr≤5, at the fixed spacing of D/X0=10. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Chem. Eng. Technol.,"Covalent immobilization of polycations onto a membrane surface has been shown to significantly improve the resistance to biofouling. The poly(vinylidene fluoride)-graft-poly(N,N-dimethylamino-2-ethylmethacrylate) (PVDF-g-PDMAEMA) copolymer was synthesized via radical grafting copolymerization and fabricated into a flat membrane. The polycation membrane surface was constructed by quaternization of PDMAEMA side chains with 1,5-dibromopentane and diquaternization of 4,4′-bipyridine. As revealed by membrane surface morphology, pore size, and porosity measurement, the polycations are distributed on the membrane surface and internal pore channel surface. Water contact angles confirm that the incorporation of polycations remarkably promotes the surface hydrophilicity of a membrane. The polycation membrane surface provides an excellent bactericidal efficiency against Escherichia coli. Biofouling is a major obstacle for ensuring long-term effectiveness of a membrane process. A strategy is proposed to construct an antibacterial poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane surface by covalent immobilization of cations. The polycation membrane surface exhibited an excellent antibacterial activity. Irreversible fouling was converted into reversible fouling. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Zhongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban),"To study the technological possibility of removing chlorine from microwave roasting zinc oxide dust, the dielectric properties of zinc oxide dust with high content of Cl, which was derived from zinc leading residue treated in rotary kiln, was measured using a microwave cavity perturbation method, and the temperature increasing characteristics of oxide zinc dust were studied under different material quantities and different microwave powers, respectively. The results show that zinc oxide dust dielectric constant and dielectric loss are proportional to the apparent density. Meanwhile, apparent density of zinc oxide dust exhibits a linear function relationship with dielectric parameters and the microwave penetration depth. Zinc oxide dust has a strong microwave absorbing ability, and can reach 800 in 6 min under microwave heating. The heating rate increases with the increase of microwave roasting power and decreases with the increase of material quantity. ©, 2015, Central South University of Technology.

RSC Adv.,"Ag-ZnO heterostructure nanoparticles were synthesized by a one-step solvothermal route from zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), silver nitrate (AgNO3), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and methanol (CH3OH). The structure, morphology, component and optical properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy, respectively. The results show that highly crystalline wurtzite-type ZnO nanoparticles matrices with an average grain size of 7.4 nm are obtained. Highly crystalline metallic Ag nanoparticles are observed on the ZnO matrix with a good combination. The absorption spectra of the Ag-ZnO heterostructure nanoparticles show the existence of a special two-absorption-region (strong UV-light and weak visible-light at 421 nm). The intensities of photoluminescence in the visible light region have a regular decrease with the increase in the load amount of Ag. The photoactivity of the as-synthesized samples was tested by measuring the degradation of azo dye Congo red (CR) under visible light irradiation. And it is found that both ZnO nanoparticles and Ag-ZnO heterostructured nanoparticles have better photocatalytic efficiency than commercial TiO2(P-25), and an appropriate loading amount of Ag nanoparticles can significantly enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. The photodegradation mechanism as well as enhancement of the photoactivity in the presence of silver nanoparticles is further investigated.

Math. Probl. Eng.,"Smoothing analysis process of distributive red-black Jacobi relaxation in multigrid method for solving 2D Stokes flow is mainly investigated on the nonstaggered grid by using local Fourier analysis (LFA). For multigrid relaxation, the nonstaggered discretizing scheme of Stokes flow is generally stabilized by adding an artificial pressure term. Therefore, an important problem is how to determine the zone of parameter in adding artificial pressure term in order to make stabilization of the algorithm for multigrid relaxation. To end that, a distributive red-black Jacobi relaxation technique for the 2D Stokes flow is established. According to the 2h-harmonics invariant subspaces in LFA, the Fourier representation of the distributive red-black Jacobi relaxation for discretizing Stokes flow is given by the form of square matrix, whose eigenvalues are meanwhile analytically computed. Based on optimal one-stage relaxation, a mathematical relation of the parameter in artificial pressure term between the optimal relaxation parameter and related smoothing factor is well yielded. The analysis results show that the numerical schemes for solving 2D Stokes flow by multigrid method on the distributive red-black Jacobi relaxation have a specified convergence parameter zone of the added artificial pressure term. © 2015 Xingwen Zhu and Lixiang Zhang.",,Open Access,20151500727741,572198,"Zhu, Xingwen (1, 2); Zhang, Lixiang (1) ","(1) Department of Engineering Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) School of Mathematics and Computer, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan; 671003, China ",,921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions - Fourier analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Lixiang(zlxzcc@126.com) ",10.1155/2015/572198,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15635147,,,,1024123X,,2015,English,Convergence of numerical methods,,19.0,,,2015,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,Smoothing analysis of distributive red-black jacobi relaxation for solving 2d stokes flow by multigrid method,,Invariant subspace - Mathematical relation - Multigrid methods - Non-staggered grids - Numerical scheme - Optimal relaxation parameter - Relaxation techniques - Smoothing factors,2015,
IET Comput. Vision,"Robust object tracking is a challenging task because of factors such as pose variation, illumination changes, abrupt motion and background clutter across the video sequence. With the introduction of the compressive sensing theory, researchers are provided with a new and effective way of real-time object tracking. In this study, an enhanced fast compressive tracking based on an adaptive measurement matrix is presented, which the authors have named 'adaptive fast compressive tracking' (AFCT). The sparsity of the matrix and the number of columns are adaptively determined according to the dimension of the Haar-like feature. This measurement matrix is fixed once it has been calculated when selecting a tracked rectangle region in the first frame. Unlike most of the existing compressive trackers, the proposed method adopts a different adaptive measurement matrix for a different targeting object. Compared with the fast compressive tracking (FCT), each measurement element contains more information for the original signal. As a result, stable object tracking is achieved by using fewer measurement elements. The proposed AFCT method can run in real time and outperforms FCT on many challenging video sequences in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness. © 2015.

RSC Adv.,"The microstructures and electronic structures of Pt mono- and bi-doped anatase TiO2(101) surfaces were investigated by density functional theory calculations to elucidate the surface doping effects and the initial stages of Pt cocatalyst formation on a TiO2photocatalyst surface. Several substitutional and interstitial configurations for the Pt impurity on the surface were studied, and the relative stability of different doping configurations was compared by the impurity formation energy. Under reducing conditions, surface interstitial (in other words, surface adsorbed) doping for Pt is more stable than any competitors (substitutional, bulk or subsurface doping) on an anatase TiO2(101) surface. Compared with bulk doping, the metal induced gap states were very localized and outstanding in the case of Pt surface interstitial doping onto a TiO2(101) surface. In the case of Pt substitutional doping, the surface doping effects were harmful for photocatalysis due to the metal induced gap states in the middle of the band gap. However, in the case of Pt interstitial doping, the surface doping effects were very favorable for photocatalysis due to the overlapping of metal induced gap states with the top of the valance band. Systematic calculations revealed that Pt doping is prone to occupy the interstitial sites on the (101) surface. In particular, in the case of Pt bi-doping, two Pt impurity atoms can be co-adsorbed on the surface to form a stable configuration due to the strong Pt-Pt atomic interaction. Therefore, Pt mono-/bi-doping on an anatase TiO2(101) surface can be considered as the initial stage (nucleation process) of Pt cocatalyst loading onto a TiO2photocatalyst surface. Therefore, the calculated results can form the basis for further investigations about Ptncluster loadings or Pt/TiO2interface formation as well as water molecule adsorption or decomposition on a Pt/TiO2composite photocatalyst. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,20150800563857,,"Liu, Qing-Lu (1, 2); Zhao, Zong-Yan (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,547.1 Precious Metals - 741.1 Light/Optics - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Binary alloys - Density functional theory - Electrochemical electrodes - Electronic structure - Energy gap - Microstructure - Molecules - Photocatalysis - Titanium dioxide,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Zong-Yan(zzy@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1039/c4ra12671h,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,23,2015,English,Platinum,,38.0,17984-17992,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,DFT study on microstructures and electronic structures of Pt mono-/bi-doped anatase TiO2(101) surface,,Atomic interactions - Composite photocatalysts - Impurity formation energy - Interface formation - Interstitial sites - Metal-induced gap state - Reducing conditions - Relative stabilities,5,

IEEE Trans Dielectr Electr Insul,"Estimation of the degree of aging and the remaining lifetime of composite insulators is an important issue. In this paper, one shed of a 500 kV AC composite insulator that has operated for three years on a transmission line was studied. The insulator shed was cut longitudinally into four layers from the upper surface to the bottom surface and tested by the thermally stimulated current (TSC) method, and each layer was also tested by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results show that the first layer has fewer trap charges than the other layers in the TSC test, but it also has the highest trap level, and the trap depth of the first layer is deeper than that of the other layers. The trap levels and the quantities of shallow traps decrease successively from the second to the fourth layer. In the FTIR spectra, the absorption peaks of the first layer are lower than those of the other layers, and the other three layers have similar absorption peaks. The aging state of the first layer is more serious than that of the other layers. The study indicates that long-term contamination and ultraviolet (UV) radiation are the main reason for the aging differences among the different insulator shed layers. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161002076820,7116359,"Zhou, Yiyang (1); Tu, Youping (1); Liu, Dinghua (1); Chen, Jingjing (1); Wang, Cong (1); Li, Ruihai (2); Zhang, Fuzeng (2); Zou, Lifeng (3); Peng, Qingjun (3) ","(1) Key Laboratory of High Voltage and EMC, North China Electric Power University, Beijing; 102206, China (2) Electric Power Research Institute of China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd., Guangzhou; 510080, China (3) Kunming Subsidiary of Yunnan Power Grid Corporation, Kunming; 650011, China ",ITDIES,413 Insulating Materials - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801 Chemistry,,,,,Contamination - Insulating materials - Insulator contamination - Thermoluminescence,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TDEI.2014.004894,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10709878,3,June 2015,English,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,,18.0,1630-1635,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,,Aging characteristic at different depths in a single composite insulators shed,,Absorption peaks - Aging characteristics - Bottom surfaces - Composite insulators - FT-IR spectrum - Single composites - Thermally stimulated current - Thermally stimulated current methods,22,
Soil Tillage Res.,"Plastic mulch is widely used for vegetable cropping in the mid-Yunnan plateau, southwestern China. However, the effects of plastic mulch on soil physical properties are poorly understood. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different plastic mulch patterns (narrow and wide plastic mulch) and rotations (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat and broccoli-zucchini-fallow) on soil physical properties and soil organic carbon content in a vegetable production system at a research station in the region. The experiment comprised four treatments and laid out in the field using randomized complete block design replicated nine times. The soil (0-20cm) under wide plastic mulch retained more water than the soil narrow plastic mulch under the vegetable growing season over 3 consecutive severe drought years. Significant decline (11%) of surface soil (0-5cm) organic carbon was observed in 2012 compared with in 2010, but soil organic carbon and physical properties did not differ significantly between the two different plastic mulch patterns. The higher macro-porosity, aggregate stability, Ksatand lower bulk density in the plastic mulched ridges imply that the conversion from narrow-plastic-mulch to wide-plastic-mulch increases mulched area thereby conserving larger area soil structure in the croplands. Although increased catch crop stubble retention in the furrows apparently improved surface soil macro-porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity, the autumn rotary cultivation in broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat rotation system has significantly decreased (5%) surface soil organic carbon. The results suggested that continued use of vegetable-cereal crop rotation system, even with stubble retention, may result in loss soil organic carbon. Further research that covers wetter years should be taken to assess effects of vegetable-cereal crop rotation pattern on soil physical properties in this region. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20144100087276,,"Zhang, G.S.

High Temp Mater Processes,"The present study reports the effect of microwave power and microwave heating time on activated carbon adsorption ability. The waste bamboo was used to preparing high surface area activated carbon via microwave heating. The bamboo was carbonized for 2 h at 600°C to be used as the raw material. According to the results, microwave power and microwave heating time had a significant impact on the activating effect. The optimal KOH/C ratio of 4 was identified when microwave power and microwave heating time were 700 W and 15 min, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, surface area was estimated to be 3441 m2/g with pore volume of 2.093 ml/g and the significant proportion of activated carbon was microporous (62.3%). The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were illustrated that activated carbon surface had abundant functional groups.

TMS Annu Meet,"Secondary V-recycling slag, an industrial waste containing high gallium is being dumped continuously, which causes the loss of gallium. Thus, the alkali fusion process was employed to recover gallium from this slag. The effects factors on extraction of gallium such as roasting temperature, roasting time, alkali fusion agent concentration and CaO concentration were investigated in the paper. The experimental results indicated that excessive roasting temperature and roasting time is unfavorable to the recovery rate of gallium. The appropriate roasting temperature and duration are 1000°C and 2 hours, respectively; The appropriate proportioning of Na2CO3: NaOH is 2:1 when the concentration of alkali fusion agent weighs 0.4 times the mass of the slag; In order to remove SiO2from the leaching liquor, CaO should be used as an additive in the roasting process.

Surf. Coat. Technol.,"Superhydrophobic wood has been created using a combination of O2plasma etching and plasma deposition of thin films to achieve the necessary combination of surface roughness and chemistry. Inherently hydrophobic fluorocarbon films (from pentafluoroethane (PFE) precursor) and hydrophilic diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings (from acetylene precursor) were both used to create highly water repellent substrates. The effect of O2plasma etching on surface roughness was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM) profilometry. The wetting behavior of the resulting wood was determined by static water contact angle and droplet sliding angle measurements. Wood samples subjected to O2plasma etching prior to fluorocarbon deposition exhibited 'roll-off' superhydrophobicity with low sliding angles; the sample in this study with the most extreme wetting properties has the highest water contact angle and lowest sliding angle reported to date for modified wood substrates (WCA 161.2°±1.5° and sliding angle ~15°), without affecting visual appearance of the wood. Due to our ability to control roughness, etched samples that were coated with hydrophilic DLC films displayed superhydrophobic behavior (WCA), although the surface was 'sticky' in that water droplets did not slide or dislodge from vertically-held substrates. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20154701573105,,"Xie, Linkun (1, 2); Tang, Zhenguan (2); Jiang, Lu (2); Breedveld, Victor (2); Hess, Dennis W.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","In this work, we report a colorimetric method for detection of ascorbic acid based on growth of silver nanoparticles by a simple and green photo-catalytic route. This route contains two steps, photo-synthesis of silver nanoclusters (NCs) with papain under UV irradiation, and catalytic growth of silver nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of ascorbic acid. The produced silver NCs at the first step is excellent catalyzer that could quickly catalyze the growth of silver NPs by Ag+and ascorbic acid in 1 min at room temperature. And thus, in the second step, the color of the mixture changed from colorless to yellow and a strong absorption band near 420 nm could be found in their absorption spectra owing to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of produced silver NPs. We found that the absorbance changes at 420 nm have a good relationship with ascorbic acid concentration, and established a spectrophotometric method for the sensing of ascorbic acid in the range from 0.25 to 50.0 μM, with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 79.2 nM. We also established a colorimetric assay of ascorbic acid by analyzing the yellow value (Y%) of the silver NPs photographs using cyan, magenta and yellow (CMY) color mode. The lowest detection concentration of ascorbic acid for colorimetric assay by the photographs could be estimated to ∼1 μM. Moreover, the method for ascorbic acid detection also has high selectivity. Potential interferes, such as glucose, dopamine, uric acid and cysteine will not affect the detection of ascorbic acid. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Minerals Eng,"Abstract High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) in centrifugal field, termed a Centrifugal High Gradient Magnetic Separation (CHGMS), has been developed to concentrate fine weakly magnetic particles such as hematite and ilmenite. In this investigation, the principle of CHGMS is theoretically discussed and a cyclic pilot-scale CHGMS separator was tested to concentrate a fine (-74 μm) hematite ore, to study the effect of key variables such as magnetic induction, rotation speed of matrix, feed flow rate and feed mass on the separation performance of the separator. The results of investigation indicate that changes in the magnetic induction and the rotation speed of matrix had the most significant influences on the performance. An increase in the rotation speed improved concentrate grade but reduced iron recovery, while the reverse was observed for changing the magnetic induction. A too low feed flow rate resulted in an extremely high recovery but a lower concentrate grade. For a given matrix configuration, there was an upper limit for feed mass as the capture area of magnetic elements in the matrix was fixed, and this limit was correlated to the rotation speed of matrix. When the variables were optimized, the CHGMS separator achieved a superior separation performance to pulsating HGMS, achieving a separation efficiency of 72.50% compared to 56.41%, respectively. It was thus concluded that the CHGMS provides a potential technique for the production of high-grade magnetic concentrate from fine weakly magnetic ores. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152100872140,4649,"Chen, Luzheng (1); Zeng, Jianwu (1); Guan, Changping (2); Zhang, Huifen (3); Yang, Ruoyu (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Sichuan Nonferrous Jinsha beneficiation Reagent Co., Ltd, Panzhihua; 617000, China (3) Department of Land Resource Engineering, Yunnan Tin College of Vocation and Technology, Gejiu; 661000, China ",MENGEB,482.2 Minerals - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 931.1 Mechanics,,,,,Centrifugation - Hematite - Ilmenite - Metal recovery - Rotation - Separators,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Luzheng(chluzheng@hotmail.com) ",10.1016/j.mineng.2015.04.018,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014ZZ0059, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51104076, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This research work was supported by the Major Technical Equipment Innovation Development and Industrialization Project of Sichuan Province of China (Grant No. 2014ZZ0059 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China – China (Grant No. 51104076 ).,,08926875,,"July 1, 2015",English,Magnetic separation,,11.0,122-127,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Minerals Engineering,,High gradient magnetic separation in centrifugal field,,Centrifugal fields - High gradient magnetic separation - Magnetic elements - Magnetic ores - Magnetic particle - Potential techniques - Separation efficiency - Separation performance,78,
Int. J. Heat Mass Transf.,"This paper is the second part of our study on the behavior of the interaction between twin transitional round fountains with equal power in a homogeneous fluid. In the first part (Mahmud et al., 2015), an experimental study using PIV techniques and flow visualization was carried out over the ranges 1≤Fr≤5 and 25≤Re≤400, where Re and Fr are the Reynolds and Froude numbers, respectively. In the current paper, this work is extended to wider ranges, i.e., 1≤Fr≤10 and 25≤Re≤1000, by a series of three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS). In addition, a preliminary study on the effect of the distance between the two fountain sources is also carried out for three representative cases. The DNS results are found to capture all the major features of the steady, and unsteady weakly multi-modal and strongly multi-modal interaction behavior, which is dominated by bobbing and flapping motions, as found by the experimental study (Mahmud et al., 2015), but over wider ranges of Fr and Re. Furthermore, the maximum fountain penetration height and the maximum thickness of the interaction region, obtained with the DNS, together with the experimental results of (Mahmud et al., 2015), are quantified and compared to the available scalings for single fountains in a homogeneous fluid at comparable Fr and Re values, and several scaling relations are then developed for these parameters over the ranges of Fr and Re considered in the current study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","Cyclodextrins (CDs) are extensively used in nanoscale electrochemical devices because of their outstanding host-guest molecular recognition capability. In this study, uniform, monodispersed 4.5 nm gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were anchored onto carboxylic graphene nanosheets (CGS) using a green approach performed under mild conditions and without using any additional surfactant or reductant. A dual β-CD (SH/NH2-β-CD)-functionalized Au@CGS (β-CD-Au@CGS) nanohybrid was successfully fabricated by subsequent conjugation of β-CD with the aid of thiol and carboxyl groups. Simultaneous electrochemical determination of hydroquinone (HQ) and p-nitrophenol (PNP) using a β-CD-Au@CGS nanohybrid-modified glassy carbon electrode was conducted. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to simultaneously quantify HQ and PNP within the concentration range of 0.01-200 μM under optimal conditions. The limits of quantification for both HQ and PNP were 0.01 μM. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of the β-CD-Au@CGS-nanohybrid electrode for HQ and PNP were 6.5 and 3.8 nM, respectively. Interference study results demonstrated that several similar aromatic compounds did not interfere during the determination of HQ and PNP, indicating the high selectivity of the β-CD-Au@CGS-nanohybrid electrode. The low detection limit and high selectivity of the proposed electrochemical sensor were caused by the high surface area, the excellent conductivity, and the high host-guest molecular recognition capability of the β-CD-Au@CGS nanohybrids. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Wuji Cailiao Xuebao,"An effective approach of alcoholysis was employed to prepare hollow core-shell MoO3-SnO2hybrid nanoparticle aggregates as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. The as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, CV, and galvanostatical method. The results show that the unique hollow structures can shorten the distance Li-ion diffusion, and the hollow structure offers a sufficient void space, which sufficiently alleviates the mechanical stress caused by volume change. The as-obtained hollow core-shell MoO3-SnO2hybrid electrodes can retain a discharge capacity of 865 mAh/g at current density of 50 mA/g after 100 charge-discharge cycles. Even at the current density of 1000 mA/g, the MoO3-SnO2hybrid electrodes can still deliver a high reversible discharge capacity of 545 mAh/g. Therefore, the hollow MoO3-SnO2hybrid electrode exhibits stable cyclability and good rate capability.

Hydrometallurgy,"In 2008, the nitric acid pressure leaching (NAPL) technology was patented and developed to treat laterite ores in China. In the following year, a pilot plant with an annual processing capacity of 330,000 tons of dry ores was assembled and tested. The pilot-scale tests were documented to illustrate the innovative technology. NAPL consists of six process steps: raw ore preparation, selective pressure leaching, pregnant leach liquor purification, Ni/Co intermediate product preparation, Mg precipitation, and HNO3regeneration/recycle. The results of the treatment of limonitic laterite ores with NAPL are as follows: (i) the recoveries of both Ni and Co were over 82%, (ii) Ni/Co hydroxide with 25.4% Ni and 2.6% Co was obtained, (iii) above 85% of HNO3could be regenerated/recycled, and (iv) several valuable by-products could be produced. The leach iron residue without sulfur in particular is marketable because of its application in iron making. Meanwhile, fibrous calcium sulfate used in papermaking was produced in the regeneration of HNO3.

J. Adhes. Sci. Technol.,"In this work, filter paper was proven to be suitable as the substrate for the preparation of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) testing specimens to predict the curing behavior of phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin adhesives for its stability during the curing temperature span. With this method, the curing behavior of PF resin was monitored by DMA in tensile-torsion mode. With the strain curves, the onset of curing temperature of PF resin could be determined clearly. The curing degree of PF resin could be calculated by the integral area in strain curves. The method to combine storage modulus (G′), tan δ, and strain curves together could explain the curing behavior of PF resin more comprehensively than the commonly used method using only G′ and tan δ curves. The DMA test results of PF resin with different viscosity and with accelerator implied the reliability of this novelty method. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,,20150900564856,,"Lei, Hong (1); Frazier, Charles E.

Comput. Stat. Data Anal.,"Under flexible distributional assumptions, the adjusted quasi-maximum likelihood (adqml) estimator for mixed regressive, spatial autoregressive model is studied in this paper. The proposed estimation method accommodates the extra uncertainty introduced by the unknown regression coefficients. Moreover, the explicit expressions of theoretical/feasible second-order-bias of the adqml estimator are derived and the difference between them is investigated. The feasible second-order-bias corrected adqml estimator is then designed accordingly for small sample setting. Extensive simulation studies are conducted under both normal and non-normal situations, showing that the quasi-maximum likelihood (qml) estimator suffers from large bias when the sample size is relatively small in comparison to the number of regression coefficients and such bias can be effectively eliminated by the proposed adqml estimation method. The use of the method is then demonstrated in the analysis of the Neighborhood Crimes Data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Sol. Energy,"In practical applications, part of solar rays incidence on reflectors of compound parabolic concentrators (CPC, in short) undergoes diffuse reflections instead of specular reflections due to imperfect reflector profile, rough surface and dust deposition, leading a considerable fraction of solar rays escape from the cavity of CPCs and making their optical performance decrease. In this article, a detailed mathematical procedure to estimate the optical efficiency factor of CPCs with semi-diffuse reflectors and one-sided flat absorber is developed based on the knowledge of two-dimensional radiation transfer, and the effect of diffuse reflections within the CPC on its energy collection is theoretically investigated. Ray-tracing analysis shows that the use of semi-diffuse reflectors in CPCs can not make solar flux on the absorber more uniform except using perfect diffuse reflectors, in turn leads the optical efficiency decrease. Comparisons of the optical efficiency factors between theoretically expected and those obtained by ray-tracing simulation indicate that the mathematical model proposed in this work can accurately estimate the optical performance of such CPC. Theoretical calculations show that the contribution of diffuse reflections within CPCs to the radiation collection of CPCs is limited as a result of the fact that the diffuse radiation transfer shape factor from the reflectors to the absorber is very small, and the annual average optical concentration decreases with the increase of diffuse reflectivity of reflectors for CPCs with a given total reflectivity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20153101089870,,"Yu, Yamei (1); Tang, Runsheng (1) ","(1) Education Ministry Key Lab. of Advanced Technology and Preparation for Renewable Energy Materials, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",SRENA4,525.2 Energy Conservation - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Diffusers (optical) - Energy efficiency - Estimation - Ray tracing - Solar absorbers,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tang, Runsheng(kingtang01@126.com) ",10.1016/j.solener.2015.07.016,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is partial fulfillment of funded research program 51466016, financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China .",,0038092X,,"November 05, 2015",English,Reflection,,16.0,44-54,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Solar Energy,,Diffuse reflections within CPCs and its effect on energy collection,,Compound parabolic concentrator - Diffuse reflector - Energy collection - Mathematical procedures - Optical efficiency - Ray tracing simulation - Theoretical analysis - Theoretical calculations,120,

The results revealed that Pu-erh teas from Yunnan, China, contained aflatoxins, especially AFB1 (8.333 g/kg in raw and 20.149 g/kg in ripe tea). All tea samples had aflatoxin levels below the national maximum permissible limits; however, the tea samples had higher aflatoxin levels than those allowed in the European Union, the USA, and Japan.

Vacuum,"The vacuum volatilization of aluminum from silicon melt is studied by the molecular interaction volume model (MIVM) in this paper. The activities and activity coefficients of components in the Si-Al binary melt were investigated based on the MIVM and the results show that the predicted values of activities are in good agreement with the experimental data. The infinite dilution activity coefficients of Al in the Si-Al binary melt at 1673-2273 K is expressed as logγAl(1)∞in Si= 7.66983 × 10-5T-0.43563.

In order to decrease the loss of silicon volatilization and enhance the separation of Al from Si-Al binary melt, the optimal temperature and time conditions for Al volatilization are 1773-1973 K and 3-5 ks, respectively. The experimental results show that the removal efficiency of Al is 99.67% by vacuum directional solidification under the optimal condition of vaporization temperature 1873 K, chamber pressure 10-3Pa, holding time 3.6 ks and solidification rate 10 μm/s. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Geotecton. Metallog.,"Analysis of mechanism of synfolding fracture is the foundation of structure numerical modeling and prediction. Based on the field observation at the Fuyang-Lin'an anticline, Zhejiang, we found that the fractures are apparently high angles to bedding on the fold limbs, and we thus propose that these fractures formed during folding. Characteristics of the fractures show that the high-angle fracture was not resulted from the interlayer-slip. We propose that the high angle fractures were related to the variation of tangential and longitudinal strain during the folding. The direction of strain ellipse axes has a deviation with respect to the directions normal and tangential to the boundaries of the folded layer. In the hinge, strain ellipse axes are perpendicular to the bedding, and on the fold limbs. This mechanism could have led to the formation of high angle fracture. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Dizhen Dizhi,"The earthquake disaster rapid assessment(EDRA)is the core technical support for the post-earthquake emergency response. At present, with the popularization of high-precision population, social and economic data, most of the subordinate units of China Earthquake Administration(CEA)have heightened the precision of hazard bearing body data used in EDRA from the original county-level precision to the 30″×30″ precision. However, while the precision of fundamental data has been heightened, no efforts have been made to improve the main algorithms and the technical process of EDRA. It turns out that the assessment has become more accurate, but the problems of the time-consuming process(10-20 minutes, probably 20 minutes or more in great earthquakes)and the low-precision losses distributions that exposed in EDRA supported by county-level precision data remain unresolved. This paper introduces the high-precision(30″×30″)hazard bearing body data, and describes the principle of EDRA and its implementation under the support of county-level precision data at first. Then the paper elaborates the principle of improving EDRA's data foundation using high-precision hazard bearing body data, the principle of improving the computation efficiency and persisting the data precision in the assessment process by means of the cell-to-cell grid algebraic operation, and the method for improving the assessment speed through the segmentation and reorganization of the technical process of EDRA. It is validated that through the improvements, the EDRA has become more accurate and much less time-consuming(less than 1 minute), and is able to output high-precision(30″×30″)distributions of seismic losses. The high-precision hazard bearing body data of wide range are the simulated data but not the survey data. Though the data have been simulated based on the census data, there is still a gap between their accuracy and the real situation. Further research and optimization on the data are needed. © 2015, Editorial Office of Seismology and Geology.

Integr Ferroelectr,"This paper addresses a neural network (NN)-based vibration control problem for a quarter-car suspension model with nonlinearity and uncertainty. First, combining the state system and the disturbance exosystem, an augmented system is constructed. Thus, an optimal regulator problem of the augmented system is built. After using Pontryagin minimum principle and the dynamic programming approach, an approximative optimal vibration control (OVC) is obtained, which is derived from a Riccati equation and two vector differential equations. A feedforward compensator is designed to suppress the vibration. And through defining the adjoint vectors, the nonlinearity and uncertainty are compensated and the physical realization problem of the disturbance compensation term can be solved. Therefore, supervised by the designed OVC and trained by the designed update rule, the Neural Network-based optimal vibration control (NNOVC) is constructed. Consequentially, the NNOVC enables making the system satisfy performance requirements easily. The related proof is given. Moreover, some numerical simulations are made. It is verified that the NNOVC can replace OVC to control the suspension effectively in face of road excitation and vehicle velocity changes.

"Proc. - Int. Conf. BioMed. Eng. Informatics, BMEI","For observing the parameters and the fitting performance, this paper compares the Homodyned K-distribution with the single distributions for RF ultrasonic speckle modeling. To implement different scatterer distributions representing a variable density of random scatterers with or without coherent component, A set of 3D scatterer models are built based on a three-dimensional Hilbert curve following Gamma distributions with different values of shape and scale parameters. The RF data are simulated by using the Field II software. Then the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for statistical histograms of the energy of the RF data is performed to obtain the values of log-likelihood and model parameters. In order to evaluate the fitting performance and parameter meaning of the HK distribution, the mean and standard deviation of these estimated values are compared with those based on the optimal fitting model chosen from commonly used single-distributions (OSD), the K, Rayleigh and Rician distributions. The results show the parameters of Homodyned K-distribution obtained by the MLE could independently represent the clustered, random or uniform characteristics for scatterer distribution. However, the fitting accuracy could only catch up with that based on the OSD joint model under the condition that the tissue contains the scatterers from medium to high effective-density, as well as deterministic or non-deterministic components. The OSD model is still a better choice in the case of the fitting performance emphasized in practice, especially the tissue with a wider range of scatterer densities and deterministic components. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161702306323,7401487,"Hu, Xiao (1); Zhang, Yufeng (1); Deng, Li (1); Peng, Shuang (1); Zhang, Kexin (2) ","(1) Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650106, China ",,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.1 Light/Optics - 753.1 Ultrasonic Waves - 922 Statistical Methods,119337.0,"October 14, 2015 - October 16, 2015","Shenyang, China","8th International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, BMEI 2015",Biomedical engineering - Coherent scattering - Maximum likelihood estimation - Speckle - Tissue - Ultrasonic scattering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yufeng ",10.1109/BMEI.2015.7401487,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509000227.0,,,"February 8, 2016",English,Parameter estimation,"Proceedings - 2015 8th International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, BMEI 2015",13.0,131-136,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2015 8th International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, BMEI 2015",Liaoning Technical University,A comparison of the Homodyned K-distribution and the single distributions for RF ultrasonic speckle modeling,,Coherent components - Deterministic component - fitting performance - K distribution - Mean and standard deviations - Rician distribution - single distributions - Statistical histograms,,
J AOAC Int,"Gentiana rigescens ('Dian Longdan' in Chinese) medicinal plant is usually used for its activities of liver protection, cholagogic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-hyperthyroidism, anti-hypertension, hyperglycemia, and relieving spasm and pain. In this study, methods for the discrimination of different geographical origins of G. rigescens by FTIR spectroscopy in hyphenation with chemometric methods were developed. Different pretreatments including standard normal variate, multiplicative scatter correction, first or second derivative, Savitzky-Golay filter, and Norris derivative filter were applied on the spectra to optimize the calibrations. According to spectrum SD, spectrum ranges (3559-2709 and 2026-756 cm-1) were selected, and principal component analysis-Mahalanobis distance (PCA-MD) model was built [the cumulative contribution rate of the first 10 principal components, determination coefficient (R2), root-mean-square error of calibration (RMSEC), and root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP), and prediction accuracy were 96.4%, 98.6%, 0.5031, 0.7758, and 96.23%, respectively]. The spectral regions (3791-3442, 3043-2765, and 2013-646 cm-1) were selected by using the variable importance in projection, and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was built (the cumulative contribution rate of the first 10 principal components, R2, RMSEC, RMSEP, and prediction accuracy were 91.3%, 92.0%, 0.1171, 0.1806, and 100%, respectively).

J Adhes.,"Ammonium pentaborate (APB) was used to modify urea formaldehyde (UF) resins, in which the formaldehyde to urea molar ratio was set at 1.80, 1.50, 1.25, and 1.05. Some specific properties, including gel time, free formaldehyde content in UF, bond strength, and formaldehyde emission levels from plywood were evaluated. The result showed that APB increased the gel time length, but also decreased free formaldehyde content and emission levels, which was reduced mostly by 79.0% and 81.4%, respectively. The result of bond strength indicated that APB was proper to modify high F/U molar ratio of UF resin regardless of the loading level, but a recommended loading level should be considered to relevantly lower the F/U molar ratio of UF. The suggested loading level of APB to UF is 8.0% to 6.0%, 6.0%, and 4.0% to UF resin with F/U molar ratio of 1.8, 1.5, and 1.25 separately. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,20144000080322,,"Gao, Wei (1, 2); Du, Guanben (1, 2); Kamdem, D.

J of Global Optim,"In this paper, we mainly study one class of convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems (MINLPs) with non-differentiable data. By dropping the differentiability assumption, we substitute gradients with subgradients obtained from KKT conditions, and use the outer approximation method to reformulate convex MINLP as one equivalent MILP master program. By solving a finite sequence of subproblems and relaxed MILP problems, we establish an outer approximation algorithm to find the optimal solution of this convex MINLP. The convergence of this algorithm is also presented. The work of this paper generalizes and extends the outer approximation method in the sense of dealing with convex MINLPs from differentiable case to non-differentiable one. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20150800550878,,"Wei, Zhou (1); Ali, M.

Ore Geol. Rev.,"The Nanling Range in South China hosts numerous W-Sn-rare metal deposits associated with several cycles of polygenetic granitic intrusions. In the Wangxianling area of the middle Nanling Range, igneous intrusions include the Wangxianling and Hehuaping granite plutons and more than 20 granite porphyry dykes. The Wangxianling pluton has a central phase of medium-grained tourmaline two-mica granite and a marginal phase of medium-grained tourmaline muscovite granite. The pluton hosts several tungsten deposits including Shuiyuanshan and Yejiwo. Mineralization type is dominantly scheelite greisen, with subordinate scheelite skarn and wolframite-quartz veins. The Hehuaping pluton composed of coarse-grained biotite granite and granite porphyry dykes to the east of the Wangxianling pluton have an associated Hehuaping tin deposit with tin skarn and subordinate porphyry and greisen mineralization.In situ zircon and cassiterite U-Pb dating, molybdenite Re-Os and muscovite40Ar-39Ar dating techniques are used to refine the age spectra of granitic rocks and W-Sn mineralization in the Wangxianling area. Granites of the Wangxianling pluton have zircon U-Pb ages of ~224Ma. Tungsten-bearing quartz veins from both the Shuiyuanshan and Yejiwo tungsten deposits have an average molybdenite Re-Os isochron age of ~224Ma, and muscovite of scheelite greisen from the Shuiyuanshan tungsten deposit yields a40Ar-39Ar plateau age of 214Ma. The two mineralization ages are consistent with the zircon U-Pb age of the Wangxianling pluton indicating a close association between pluton emplacement and W mineralization in the Late Triassic. Both the Hehuaping pluton and granite porphyry dykes have zircon U-Pb ages of ~156Ma. In situ LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of cassiterite in both the tin skarn and tin greisen yields an average age of ~156Ma, showing that the Sn mineralization occurred at a similar time to the Late Jurassic granitic magmatism. Thus, two mineralization events are identified in the Wangxianling area, and include an earlier W dominant mineralization event and a later Sn dominant mineralization event. The earlier event is related both spatially and temporally to intrusion of the Late Triassic S-type Wangxianling granite pluton, whereas the later mineralization is associated both spatially and temporally with intrusion of the Late Jurassic Hehuaping A2-type granite pluton and A2-type granite porphyry dykes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..",,,20150700529525,,"Zhang, Rong-Qing (1); Lu, Jian-Jun (1); Wang, Ru-Cheng (1); Yang, Ping (2); Zhu, Jin-Chu (1); Yao, Yuan (3); Gao, Jian-Feng (4); Li, Chao (5); Lei, Ze-Heng (6); Zhang, Wen-Lan (1); Guo, Wei-Min (3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, Xianlin University Town, Nanjing; 210023, China (2) Geological Institute of Yunnan Nonferrous Geological Bureau, Kunming; 650216, China (3) Nanjing Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources, CGS, Nanjing; 210016, China (4) Geological Survey of Canada, Ottawa; ON; K1A 0E8, Canada (5) National Research Center of Geoanalysis, 26 Baiwanzhuang, Beijing; 10037, China (6) Southern Hunan Institute of Geology and Survey, Chenzhou; 423000, China ",,481.1 Geology - 482 Mineralogy - 504.3 Heavy Metal Mines - 546.1 Lead and Alloys - 546.2 Tin and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals,,,,,Binary alloys - Deposits - Geochronology - Granite - Mica - Mineralogy - Osmium alloys - Quartz - Rhenium alloys - Silicate minerals - Tin - Tin deposits - Tungstate minerals - Tungsten deposits - Zircon,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lu, Jian-Jun(lujj@nju.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2014.09.021,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: BAFS, Sponsor: Beijing Academy of Food Sciences; Number: 2012CB416702, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41273053, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 41302072, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41273053 and 41302072) and the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (2012CB416702).

Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"This paper presents a novel approach for combining and blending a set of aligned images into a composite mosaic with no visible seams and minimal texture distortion. To accelerate execution speed in building high resolution mosaics, the compositing seam is found efficiently via seeded region growing using a photometric criterion. A contribution of this paper is to use seeded region growing on image differences to find possible seams over areas of low photometric difference. This can result in significant reduction of blending time. The proposed method presents several advantages. The using of seeded region growing over image pairs guarantees the approximate optimal solution for each intersection region. The independence of such regions makes the algorithm suitable for parallel implementation. The using of priority queue leads to reduced memory requirements and a compact storage of the input data. Finally, it allows the efficient creation of large mosaics, without user intervention. We also evaluate the proposed blending method with pixel based graph cut and watershed based graph cut to illustrate the performance of the approach on image sequences with qualitative and quantitative comparison. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,,20154601539192,,"Zhao, Yili (1, 2); Xu, Dan (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) School of Computer and Information, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650224, China ",,"722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 941.4 Optical Variables Measurements",,,,,Digital storage - Graphic methods - Photometry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Yili(ylzhao@vip.sina.com) ",10.1007/978-3-662-47791-5_45,Engineering Village,Compendex,Book chapter (CH),,,,9783662477908.0,18650929,,2015,English,Image segmentation,,10.0,408-415,,2015,Springer Verlag,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,Fast image blending using seeded region growing,,Graph cut - Image blending - Image mosaic - Seeded region growing - Watershed segmentation,525,

Simple structure and anti-electromagnetic interference of the strain sensor can be directly buried in the dry air core reactor encapsulation.

Dry type air core reactor temperature experiment results show that the encapsulation temperature rises with the growth of power-on time and the axial strain and radial strain of 35 kV dry type air core reactor encapsulation increase in the opposite directions. About five hours later, encapsulation strain is stabilized, and at this time, the axial strain is about -3200 μΕ, while the radial strain is about -4100 μΕ.

RSC Adv.,"In the present work, highly stable magnetic nanoparticles covalently functionalized by polyethyleneimine (PEI), denoted as PEI-MNPs, were prepared based on the glutaraldehyde crosslinking reaction between the aldehyde moiety in glutaraldehyde and the amine groups in both PEI and Fe3O4magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), and showed strong adsorption affinity to Cr(vi). The successful modification by PEI was confirmed by a series of measurements, such as TEM, XRD, FT-IR, TGA, et al. The time-dependent adsorption experiments indicated that the adsorption of Cr(vi) onto PEI-MNPs finished within 10 min and the adsorption process could be described by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The studies on the adsorption of Cr(vi) revealed that the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with the adsorption capacity of 175.76 mg g-1at 318 K fit the adsorption data. The calculated thermodynamic parameters (ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS) indicated that adsorption of Cr(vi) on PEI-MNPs was spontaneous and exothermic. Furthermore, the stability testing demonstrated that the used adsorbents could be regenerated effectively with 0.5 mol L-1NaOH solution and no significant loss of adsorption capacity were observed after a run of 20 adsorption-desorption cycles, showing their high stability in extremely acidic and alkaline solution. Most importantly, the obtained PEI-MNPs composite can effectively and selectively absorb Cr(vi) from complex industrial wastewater, indicating that PEI-MNPs could be used as a promising adsorbent for removal of Cr(vi) from real wastewater with high efficiency.

J. Environ. Sci. Health Part A Toxic Hazard. Subst. Environ. Eng.,"There is scarcity of data on contamination with radiocesium (134/137Cs) of edible mushrooms from the Southwestern Asia. This study aimed to get insight into activity concentration of artificial nuclides134/137Cs and natural40K and226Ra in mushrooms from Yunnan province, which is major producer in China. The specimens of pantropical mushroom Macrocybe gigantea were collected from the wild and from a farm across Yunnan land in 2012-2013 and analyzed using gamma spectrometry with hyperpure germanium coaxial detector (HPGe). M. gigantea showed low activity concentrations of137Cs (median value for dehydrated caps was 4.5 Bq kg-1and 5.4 Bq kg-1for stipes) while134Cs was not detected. Natural radionuclide40K showed 2-3 orders of magnitude greater activity concentration compared to artificial137Cs in M. gigantea. The activity concentrations of226Ra from uranium and radium decay series for most of the consignments of M. gigantea examined were below the method's limit of detection. The nominal effective dose equivalent for the Yunnan people from the dietary intake of137Cs was assessed to be below 0.01 μSv per annum on the average, and that from40K to be below 0.1 μSv per annum. Data available for the first time on activity concentrations of137Cs in wild-grown saprobic mushroom from this region of Asia suggest low pollution with radiocesium from fallout there. Hence, the likely health risks from intake of137Cs from cooked M. gigantea are in practice of mushrooms absent for human consumers there. Because of abundance of mushrooms in Yunnan and high significance of the region as producer and exporter a wider study using many species is necessary to fill a gap on possible radioactive contamination and risk to mushroom consumers.

"IEEE Int. Conf. Signal Process., Commun. Comput., ICSPCC","This paper presents three algorithms to suppress sidelobe of images produced by both RDA and CSA imaging algorithms. The first is windowed RDA (W-RDA) and windowed CSA(W-CSA) which decreases the sidelobe and increases the signal-to-noise ratio. The second is spatially variant apodization RDA and CSA (SVA-RDA and SVA-CSA) which weighs the amplitude of each point in frequency domain and then suppresses sidelobe effectively, and keeps good main lobe resolution at the same time. The third is a combination of the previous two as WSVA-RDA and WSVA-CSA which overcomes the deficiency of the previous two and has a better result.

Trans Nonferrous Met Soc China,"The crystallization behavior and kinetics of CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2(CMAS) glass with the Fe2O3content ranging from zero to 5% were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The structure and phase analyses were made by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The experiment results show that the endothermic peak temperature about 760 °C is associated with transition and the exothermic peak temperature about 1000 °C is associated with crystallization. The crystallization peak temperature decreases with increasing the Fe2O3content.

Gaodianya Jishu,"We proposed methods for self-powering manner of intelligent sensors employed by online monitoring of power equipment. By harvesting ambient energy, i.e. thermoelectric and magnetic energy, a solution to the challenges from unobtainable and unreliable power supply of sensors in some cases is put forward. Feasibility and properties of the two approaches were investigated by both calculation and experiments, followed by a test with loads using Zigbee wireless sensors. The results indicate that, in the analysis condition of the paper, thermoelectric energy harvesting can output maximum electric power of 475 mW by utilizing dissipated heat from a large oil-immersed transformer, while temperature difference between hot and cold side of the thermoelectric module reaches 55 K. And when the current on bus bar reaches 480 A, Zigbee node can be enabled to work continuously. The magnetic energy harvesting can output maximum electric power of 162 mW accordingly, with the coil stuck on the bus bar of 35 kV. The two energy harvesting approaches can satisfy the energy demand of low-power Zigbee sensors and they have certain prospect of application. © 2015, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPI.

Acta Geophys. Sin.,"Tengchong Volcano Area (24°40'-25°30'N, 98°15'-98°45'E) is one of the most famous and youngest volcano-active areas in China. It is located on the northeast side of the collision belt between the Indian and Euroasian plates. It is a part of Myanmar Arc seismic structure, belonging to the Himalayan strong-earthquake belt. There are 68 volcanoes distributed in the region of 90 km long in the north-south direction and 50 km wide in the east-west direction. Among them are 4 Holocene (Q4) volcanoes, 18 Late-Pleistocene (Q3) volcanoes, and 38 Early-Pleistocene (Q1) volcanoes. To study the geologic evolution and volcanic activity of the Tengchong Volcano Area, we need to investigate the variation of crustal thickness and the distribution of the Poisson's ratio in the area, as well as the detailed thickness and topography of the lithosphere. We use the seismic data observed by 9 digital broadband stations of Tengchong Earthquake-Monitoring Net from July 2007 through December 2011. The P receiver functions are used to study the crustal thickness and the Poisson's ratio in the region, while the converted phases at the Moho and the LAB in the S receiver functions are utilized to get the depths of the Moho and the LAB. To reduce the noises and remove the effect of the heterogeneity, we stack the P and S receiver functions beneath each station, respectively, to get an averaged trace of P receiver functions and an average trace of S receiver functions. Before the stacking of the weak converted phases from the Moho and the LAB, each seismic event is moveout corrected to the reference epicentral distance of 67 degree (corresponding to the ray parameter of 6.40 s/deg). Based on the IAS91 model, the receiver functions are transformed from the time domain to the depth domain. 1) The crustal thickness of Tengchong Volcanic Area ranges from 33.5 to 38.0 km. 2) The Poisson's ratio of the area mainly varies from 0.26 to 0.32. The ratio beneath 6 stations is over 0.29, which is attributed to the increase of mafic component in the crust. There may exist two magma chambers. 3) The thickness of the lithosphere ranges from 78.2 to 88.0 km. The crustal thickness of Tengchong Volcanic Area ranges from 33.5 to 38.0 km, with a feature of being thick at the north and south ends but thin in the middle (or the Moho is uplifted in the middle part). The Poisson's ratio is between 0.262 and 0.322. Six stations present high Poisson's ratio, and the crust may be partially melted in some local areas. There probably exist two magma chambers on the east side of Mazhang and the area of Tengchong-Shaba, but their scopes need further determination. The thickness of the lithosphere ranges from 78.2 to 88.0 km, being thinner than that of the surrounding area. In the center of the volcano area (i.e., the convergence between the Tengchong volcanic fault and the Yingjiang-Longchuan fault), both the crust and the lithosphere are uplifted. The lithosphere presents a dome shape obviously, caused by the extension and thinning of the lithosphere by the upwelling of the asthenosphere (or the uplift of mantle hot materials). ©, 2015, Science Press.

It was the different heating rate (5, 10, 20 K/min) under the mixed O2/CO2atmospheres that made the experiment feasible. The combustion parameters and kinetic parameters of the Xiaolongtan brown coals are determined based on experimental results. The results showed that: the TG and DTG curves of coal would move to a lower temperature area, the ignition and combustion temperature would be higher, the burning time would be longer. Both the flammability index and composite combustion characteristic parameters would increase while the heating rate was increasing.

Chem. Eng. J.,"In this work, we present a new, facile and low-cost method to synthesize TiO2-wood charcoal composites photocatalysts (denoted as TiO2-WC) by using the wood tissue as charcoal resources and bio-template. TiO2-WC was prepared by the dip-sol-gel method, which was followed by calcination. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2adsorption/desorption measurement, element analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that titania particles of 10-20nm were dispersed on the wood charcoal which had a mimicked wood tissue structure. And the titania in composites was found to be composed of 75-80wt% anatase and 20-25wt% rutile. The mass ratios of wood charcoal in TiO2-WC were 28.20-39.94wt%. The adsorption ability and photocatalytic activity of the prepared TiO2-WC composites were evaluated by the removal ratio of bisphenol A (BPA). The results showed that the prepared TiO2-WC composites had extraordinary adsorption ability for BPA and good photocatalytic activity.

RSC Adv.,"In the present work, ultrafine Pd clusters with a uniform size of ∼2.0 nm were monodispersed on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using a clean and green approach in the absence of additional reductants and surfactants. Disulfide linked β-cyclodextrin dimer (SS-β-CD) was non-covalently bonded to the surface of Pd@RGO. By combining the merits of Pd@RGO and the SS-β-CD, a highly sensitive electrochemical sensing platform was developed based on the SS-β-CD-Pd@RGO nanohybrids. Simultaneous electrochemical detection of baicalin and luteolin using a SS-β-CD-Pd@RGO nanohybrid-modified electrode is described for the first time. The SS-β-CD showed a higher supramolecular recognition capability than the native β-CD, which may be caused by the cooperative binding abilities of two adjacent CD units. Due to the synergistic effects from the Pd@RGO (e.g. good electrochemical properties and large surface area) and SS-β-CD (e.g. hydrophilic external surface, high supramolecular recognition, and good enrichment capability), the SS-β-CD-Pd@RGO modified electrode was found to have linear response ranges of 0.02-20.00 μM for baicalin and 0.01-10.00 μM for luteolin with relatively low detection limits of 0.0052 μM for baicalin and 0.0070 μM for luteolin. The results indicated that SS-β-CD-Pd@RGO nanohybrids are excellent sensing materials for the electrochemical determination of flavonoids.

IEEE Trans Appl Supercond,"Chemical doping is considered as an economic and effective method to enhance the flux pinning properties of high-temperature superconducting materials. However, it is difficult to realize a large doping amount in textured grown bulk superconductors since the doped particles are prone to accumulate and affect the melt-textured growth of the bulk superconductors. In the present work, we introduced nanosized ZrO2particles into the Gd-Ba-Cu-O samples through the external liquid source by infiltration method. A large doping amount of ZrO2particles up to 20 mol% has been realized in finely grown Gd-Ba-Cu-O samples. Improvement in the trapped field has been found for low-level doped samples. The localized microstructure and distribution of the doped particles have been observed by scanning electron microscopy and discussed in this paper. © 2014 IEEE.",,,20150400447332,6907971.0,"Zhou, Difan (1, 2); Izumi, Mitsuru (1); Fujimoto, Takashi (3); Zhang, Yufeng (4); Zhou, Wen Li (4); Xu, Kun (5) ","(1) Laboratory of Applied Physics, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo; 135-8533, Japan (2) Department of Maritime Technology, National Institutes of Technology, Yugel College, Ochi-gun; 794-2593, Japan (3) Department of Electronic Mechanical Engineering, National Institutes of Technology, Yuge College, Ochi-gun; 794-2593, Japan (4) Department of Mathematics and Physics, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai; 200090, China (5) Key Lab. of Yunnan Higher Education Institutes for Advanced Functional and Low Dimensional Material, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; 655011, China ",ITASE9,701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.3 Superconducting Materials - 708.3.1 High Temperature Superconducting Materials - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds,,,,,Barium compounds - Flux pinning - Gadolinium compounds - High temperature superconductors - Organic superconducting materials - Scanning electron microscopy - Zirconia,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TASC.2014.2359768,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10518223,3,"June 1, 2015",English,Copper compounds,,19.0,,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity,,Introducing nanosized pinning centers into bulk Gd-Ba-Cu-O by infiltration method,,Bulk superconductors - Chemical doping - High-temperature superconducting materials - Liquid sources - Melt textured growth - Pinning center - Pinning properties - Trapped field magnet,25,
Environ. Monit. Assess.,"Ecosystem service (ES) relationship occurs due to two types of mechanisms: (1) interact directly or (2) interact through the impact of a shared factor. Identifying such mechanisms behind ES relationship within a single land-use/land-cover category and combining it with a system thinking framework is especially necessary for effective decision-making to manage multiple ESs generated by this land-use/land-cover. In this study, we use tea plantations in China to investigate mechanisms behind ES relationships. We find that tea production is positively correlated with four regulating services (i.e., carbon sequestration, soil N protection, soil P protection, and water conservation). Several regulating services, such as carbon sequestration and soil N, P, and K protection, have positive correlations with each other. Tea production, carbon sequestration, and soil retention are significantly correlated with local annual mean temperature and precipitation. We then establish driver–pressure–state–impact–response (DPSIR) framework for tea plantations, which has been widely used for environmental management issues. Integrating our findings of ES relationship into DPSIR framework, we can estimate how ES change is responding to two types of responses: response to control drivers and response to maintain or restore state. Scenario analysis showed that the responses to control drivers have a larger impact on ES. We discuss that DPSIR would favor managing multiple ES because it enables a more precise understanding of how ES interacts through the effects of factors from various hierarchies. Finally, we suggest integrating ES direct interaction into DPSIR framework. We think such integration could improve the ability of DPSIR framework to support decision-making in multiple ES management, specifically in at least three aspects: (1) favor to identify all possible response alternatives, (2) enable us to evaluate ES which cannot be assessed if without such combining, and (3) help to identify ecological leverage points where small management investment can yield substantial benefits. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,,20152200888017,,"Xue, Hui (1, 2); Li, Shiyu (3); Chang, Jie (1) ","(1) College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, 866 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou; Zhejiang; 310058, China (2) International Colleges, Qingdao University, Qingdao; 266061, China (3) Engineering Technology Institute, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",EMASDH,403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 444 Water Resources - 454 Environmental Engineering - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 601.3 Mechanisms - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 912.2 Management - 971 Social Sciences,,,,,Carbon - Decision making - Economics - Environmental management - Land use - Mechanisms - Soil conservation - Soils - Water conservation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chang, Jie ",10.1007/s10661-015-4303-2,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15732959,,,,01676369,3,2015,English,Ecosystems,,44.0,,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,Combining ecosystem service relationships and DPSIR framework to manage multiple ecosystem services,,Annual mean temperatures - Carbon sequestration - Direct interactions - Dpsir frameworks - Ecosystem services - Positive correlations - Scenario analysis - Single land-use/land-cover,187,
J. Biotechnol.,"Thermostable fusion peptide partners are valuable in engineering thermostability in proteins. We evaluated the Arabidopsis counterpart (AtRAce) and an acidified derivative (mRAce) of the conserved carboxyl extension (RAce) of plant Rubisco activase (RCA) for their thermostabilizing properties in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a protein fusion strategy. We used AtRAce and mRAce as fusion tails for the thermolabile protein RCA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum. The homologous fusion of AtRAce with Arabidopsis RCA2 and the heterologous fusion of AtRAce with tobacco RCA2 increased the thermostability of both proteins. The acidified derivative mRAce conferred greater thermostability upon both proteins as compared with AtRAce. Moreover, mRAce enhanced the thermostability of other two thermolabile proteins from Jatropha curcas: the cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 (JcAPX1) and the TATA-box binding protein isoform 1 (JcTBP1). We further report - for the first time - that JcTBP1 mediates heat tolerance in vivo in yeast. Thus, our study identifies a C-terminal acidic mini-peptide - the acidified derivative mRAce - with potential uses in improving the thermostability of heat-labile proteins and their associated heat tolerance in host organisms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20153601246420,,"Zhang, Mengru (1); Li, Xujuan (2); Yang, Yumei (1); Luo, Zhu (1); Liu, Chang (1); Gong, Ming (1); Zou, Zhurong (1) ","(1) School of Life Sci., Engineering Research Center of Sustainable Dev., Utilization of Biomass Energy, Ministry of Education, Key Lab. of Biomass Energy, Environmental Biotechnology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Sugarcane Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yunnan Key Laboratory of Sugarcane Genetic Improvement, Kaiyuan, Yunnan; 661600, China ",JBITD4,461.9 Biology - 822.3 Food Products,,,,,Escherichia coli - Peptides - Yeast,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gong, Ming(gongming63@163.com) ",10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.08.021,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734863,"Number: 31260064, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31460067, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 31160169, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work was supported by several grants from the National Foundations of Natural Sciences, China (No. 31260064 to MG, No. 31160169 , 31460067 to ZZ).

J. Agric. Food Chem.,"A group of morphology regulatory arthrosporol metabolites have been recently characterized from carnivorous fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora that can develop trapping networks to capture their prey. A combination of genetic manipulation and chemical analyses was applied to characterize the function of one polyketide synthase (PKS) gene AOL-s00215g283 in A. oligospora, which was putatively involved in the production of 6-methylsalicylic acid. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the disruption of the PKS gene not only led to the total loss of the arthrosporol A but also resulted in significant reduction in the production of secondary metabolites in the cultural broth of the mutant ΔAOL-s00215g283 strain. Interestingly, the mutant strain displayed significant increases in the trap formation and the nematicidal activity by 10 and 2 times, respectively, higher than the wild-type strain. These findings revealed a pathogenicity-related biosynthetic gene of this agriculturally important biological agent and have implications for establishment of efficient fungal biocontrol agents. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20154401463711,,"Xu, Zi-Fei (1); Wang, Bai-Le (1); Sun, Hong-Kai (1); Yan, Ni (1); Zeng, Zhi-Jun (1); Zhang, Ke-Qin (1); Niu, Xue-Mei (1) ","(1) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources of the Ministry of Education, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, Korea, Republic of ",JAFCAU,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Biochemistry - Biocontrol - Biomolecules - Biosynthesis - High performance liquid chromatography - Ketones - Metabolites - Plants (botany) - Tissue,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Niu, Xue-Mei(xmniu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04244,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205118,,,,00218561,41,"October 21, 2015",English,Genes,,31.0,9076-9082,,2015,American Chemical Society,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,,High Trap Formation and Low Metabolite Production by Disruption of the Polyketide Synthase Gene Involved in the Biosynthesis of Arthrosporols from Nematode-Trapping Fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora,,Arthrobotrys oligospora - arthrosporol - Fungal biocontrol agents - Genetic manipulations - Metabolite production - Nematode trapping fungi - Polyketide synthase genes - Secondary metabolites,63,

Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao,"A novel environmental friendly technique was developed to remove the As and Sb impurities from the crude tin (with Cu and Fe removed in advance) on industrial scale by a combination of vacuum distillation and multi-stage condensation. The impact of the distillation conditions, including but not limited to the distillation temperature and time, pressure, daily-processing capacity, and multi-stage condensation, on the removal rates of As and Sb and extraction rate of Sn were theoretically analyzed and experimentally evaluated. The preliminary results show that the new technique is capable of refining the crude tin by removing most of As and Sb impurities. For instance, under the conditions: a temperature in 1200~1400 range, a pressure in 10~30 Pa range and with a daily-processing capacity of 18~20 t/d, the purity of the distilled Sn was 99.575% (wt), because over 70% of the As and Sb impurities were removed and turned into metallic As and Sn-Pb-Sb alloy. ©, 2015, Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao/Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology.

Circ Syst Signal Process,"The acoustic recognition technology of unattended ground sensor systems applied in wild environments is faced with the challenge of complicated and strong acoustic noise, especially wind noise. Moreover, the commonly used Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are sensitive to noise interference. To resolve the problem, a robust feature extraction method, called harmonic Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (HMFCCs), is proposed for acoustic target classification. By combining an acoustic signal’s harmonic model with the MFCC method, the HMFCC has the ability to emphasize the signals emitted by the principal acoustic components of the target. In the experiment conducted for this study, three data sets are sampled under the same conditions, except for wind power levels. Then the classifier, which is trained by one of the three data sets, is used to recognize the others data sets. According to the experimental results, the HMFCC-based classification accuracies of the three data sets are higher than those of other state-of-the-art methods, indicating that HMFCC is a kind of noise-insensitive feature. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20152500949111,,"Huang, Jingchang (1); Xiao, Shiliang (1); Zhou, Qianwei (1); Guo, Feng (1); You, Xing (1); Li, Haiyan (2); Li, Baoqing (1) ","(1) Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology, CAS, Shanghai; 200050, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",CSSPEH,"615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 732.2 Control Instrumentation - 751.4 Acoustic Noise - 751.5 Speech - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921.6 Numerical Methods",,,,,Acoustic noise - Extraction - Feature extraction - Harmonic analysis - Speech recognition - Unattended sensors - Wind power,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Jingchang ",10.1007/s00034-014-9953-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15315878,,,,0278081X,7,"July 18, 2015",English,Classification (of information),,16.0,2395-2406,,2015,Birkhauser Boston,"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing",,A Robust Feature Extraction Algorithm for the Classification of Acoustic Targets in Wild Environments,,Acoustic targets - Harmonic - Mel frequency cepstral co-efficient - Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients - Robust - Robust feature extractions - State-of-the-art methods - Unattended ground sensors,34,

We first parsed all source sentences using the Berkeley Chinese parser for Chinese-to-Naxi word alignment sentences and ran the Chinese semantic role labeler on all source parse trees to annotate semantic roles and obtain relevance between predicates and arguments. Then, we project semantic roles from the source side to the target side through word alignments and train the predicate-argument relevance model according to predicate-argument structure both sides. Finally, the proposed model is integrated into loglinear model to generate candidate sentences which are appropriate for Naxi grammar.

Energy Build.,"Abstract The lauric acid (LA)/diatomite composite phase change materials (PCMs) were prepared using a direct impregnation method, in which LA was chosen as PCM. The chemical structure, chemical compatibility, element composition, crystalline structure, thermal properties and thermal stability of LA/diatomite composite were extensively investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis. FTIR and XRD results indicate that there are only physical interactions between LA and diatomite in LA/diatomite composite. The decrease of XRD intensity of composite PCM confirms the reduction of the crystalline size of LA in LA/diatomite composite. The melting and freezing temperatures of composite PCM are 40.9 °C and 38.7 °C respectively. The latent heat of composite PCM is 57.2 J/g. LA/diatomite composite does not decompose when the surrounding temperature is lower than 157 °C, indicating that the composite PCM has a good thermal stability. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20153201107944,5965.0,"Fu, Xiaowei (1); Liu, Zhimeng (1); Xiao, Yao (1); Wang, Jiliang (2); Lei, Jingxin (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering, Polymer Research Institute, Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610065, China (2) School of Chemistry Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",ENEBDR,641.1 Thermodynamics - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933.1 Crystalline Solids - 944.6 Temperature Measurements - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Chemical stability - Composite materials - Crystalline materials - Differential scanning calorimetry - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Gravimetric analysis - Heat storage - Saturated fatty acids - Thermal energy - Thermodynamic stability - Thermogravimetric analysis - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lei, Jingxin(jxlei@scu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.06.059,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,03787788,,"August 4, 2015",English,Phase change materials,,32.0,244-249,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Energy and Buildings,,Preparation and properties of lauric acid/diatomite composites as novel form-stable phase change materials for thermal energy storage,,Chemical compatibility - Composite phase change materials - Diatomite - Form stable phase change material - Freezing temperatures - Lauric acid - Surrounding temperature - Thermal gravimetric analysis,104,
J. Agric. Food Chem.,"Rubrosterone, possessing various remarkable bioactivities, is an insect-molting C19-steroid. However, only very small amounts are available for biological tests due to its limited content from plant sources. Fungi of genus Fusarium have been reported to have the ability to convert C27-steroids into C19-steroids. In this study, Asparagus filicinus, containing a high content of 20-hydroxyecdysone, was utilized to accumulate rubrosterone through solid fermentation by Fusarium oxysporum. The results showed that F. oxysporum had the ability to facilitate the complete biotransformation of 20-hydroxyecdysone to rubrosterone by solid-state fermentation.

Huagong Xuebao,"The dissolution kinetics and behavior of cobalt extraction from low nickel matte converter slag by pressure oxidative leaching with sulfuric acid were investigated. The effects of stirring speed, temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, oxygen partial pressure and particle size on extraction rate of cobalt were studied for exploring the kinetics law of cobalt dissolution from the slag. The experimental results showed that the extraction efficiency of cobalt increased with the increases of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration and oxygen partial pressure, but the sulfuric acid concentration above 40 g·L-1can cause an increase of iron extensive dissolving in the solution. The stirring speeding above 700 r·min-1, oxygen partial pressure beyond 650 kPa and particle size of less than 74 μm were found to have no effect on the extraction of cobalt. The dissolution kinetics analysis of the experimental data based on the shrinking core model for various conditions indicated that the reaction rate of leaching was mainly controlled by the chemical reaction during its early stages, then switched to be controlled by mixed chemical-reaction and product-layer diffusion, and finally was controlled solely by diffusion through a surface product layer in the later stage. The activation energy was calculated to be 43.19 kJ·mol-1in the early surface chemical reaction controlled stage and 10.49 kJ·mol-1in the later diffusion controlled stage, respectively. In the chemical reaction controlled stage, the reaction orders with respect to sulfuric acid concentration, oxygen partial pressure and particle size are 0.79, 0.85 and -0.95, respectively. © All right reserved.",,,20154401454162,,"Liao, Yalong (1); Huang, Feirong (1); Zhou, Juan (1); Li, Bingjie (1) ","(1) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650093, China ",HUKHAI,548.1 Nickel - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity,,,,,Activation energy - Cobalt - Diffusion - Dissolution - Enzyme kinetics - Extraction - Kinetics - Leaching - Nickel - Oxygen - Partial pressure - Particle size - Slags - Sulfur determination - Sulfuric acid - Surface reactions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liao, Yalong(liaoylsy@163.com) ",10.11949/j.issn.0438-1157.20150226,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,04381157,10,"October 1, 2015",Chinese,Reaction kinetics,,24.0,3971-3978,,2015,Chemical Industry Press,Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal,,Kinetics and behavior of cobalt extraction from low nickel matte converter slag by pressure oxidative leaching with sulfuric acid,,Converter slags - Dissolution kinetics - Extraction efficiencies - Multiphase reactions - Oxygen partial pressure - Pressure oxidative leaching - Shrinking core model - Surface chemical reactions,66,

Xiyou Jinshu,"The effects of butyl xanthate, butylamine aerofloat, b sulfur nitrogen and copper sulfate on the flotation of indium carrier zinc mineral, germanium carrier zinc mineral and pyrite were studied. The results indicated that the recoveries of the three kinds of minerals were the highest in the presence of butyl xanthate and the lowest in b sulfur nitrogen without activator and under the same flotation condition. Higher recoveries and butyl xanthate or butyl amine aerofloat adsorption of minerals were acquired under the acid condition in the order of pyrite>indium carrier sphalerite>germanium carrier sphalerite.

Water Resour. Manage.,"Medium range daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasts are very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators for improving their irrigation scheduling. We tested four artificial neural networks (ANNs) for EToforecasting using forecasted temperatures data retrieved from public weather forecasts. Daily meteorological data were collected to train and validate the ANNs against the Penman–Monteith (PM) model. And then, the temperature forecasts for 7-day ahead were entered into the validated ANNs to produce EToforecast outputs. The forecasting performances of models were evaluated through comparisons between the EToforecasted by ANNs and ETocalculated by PM from the observed meteorological data. The correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted temperatures for all stations were all greater than 0.91, and the accuracy of the minimum temperature forecast (error within ± 2 °C) ranged from 68.34 to 91.61 %, whereas for the maximum temperature it ranged from 51.78 to 57.44 %. The accuracy of the EToforecast (error within ± 1.5 mm day−1) ranged from 75.53 to 78.14 %, the average values of the mean absolute error ranged from 0.99 to 1.09 mm day−1, the average values of the root mean square error ranged from 0.87 to 1.36 mm day−1, and the average values of the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.70 to 0.75. The results suggested that ANNs can be considered as a promising EToforecasting tool.

Soil moisture was determined. The results showed that there was a very significant interaction between the emitter type and the soil type, the emitter type and the irrigation time (P 0.05). The flow adjustable irrigation emitter has 8 horizontal drainage holes. The horizontal width of the irrigation water in the 2 soils was both wide (about 25 cm). The drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch has a downward single hole. The horizontal width of the irrigation water in the 2 soils was both narrow (about 16 cm). Therefore, for the wide root extension of crops, the application of the flow adjustable irrigation emitter should be more suitable, on the contrary, the drip irrigation belt embedded with inner patch are used instead. In the Yunnan red loam, the areas with higher water content for the root micro-irrigation using belt embedded with inner patch were more close to those of crop roots, the areas with higher water content for the surface drip irrigation basically concentrated on the upper part of the soil of the flower pot. Therefore, compared to the surface drip irrigation, water loss due to evaporation in root irrigation greatly reduced. In the Yunnan red loam, the matric potential to the movement of irrigation water played the main role and water was easy to sink; In yellow sand soil, the gravitational potential to the movement of irrigation water played a main role which could cause the deep percolation of water. In the Yunnan red loam, the soil moisture areas corresponding to 70% of the total area mostly had the narrow and low water content when the irrigation time was short. And each section was continuous. The range of the soil moisture section corresponding to 70% of the total area was the widest in the 3 irrigation times. And the uniformity of soil water distribution was also the highest; in the yellow sand soil, with the increase of irrigation time, the range of the soil moisture content section corresponding to 70% of the total area was larger than that in Yunnan red loam. This showed that sections with low and high soil moisture content were in the majority with uneven distribution in Yunnan red loam. And the sections with middle soil moisture content were in the majority with even distribution in yellow sand soil. This paper provides valuble information for increasing water use efficiency in the roots of micro-irrigation system. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Int. Conf. Wavelet Anal. Pattern Recogn.,"The key of the problem of single-image super-resolution is the estimation of the relationship between low- and high-resolution images. In this paper, a novel single-image super-resolution algorithm is proposed which is motivated by the local manifold information of training samples and the structure information of image patches captured by matrix-value operators. By using the local manifold information of training samples, the similarities among low-resolution images are well estimated. Then, the structure information of image patches contained in the matrix-value operators provides the structure information of high-resolution image patches to the learning processes. By combining these information of image patches, the proposed single-image super-resolution algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20160201799290,7295923.0,"Tang, Yi (1); Chen, Hong (2) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) College of Science, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan; 430070, China ",,741.1 Light/Optics - 912.4 Personnel - 921 Mathematics,117300.0,"July 12, 2015 - July 15, 2015","Guangzhou, China","International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition, ICWAPR 2015",Optical resolving power - Pattern recognition - Sampling - Wavelet analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICWAPR.2015.7295923,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),21585709,,,9781467372244.0,21585695,,"October 9, 2015",English,Personnel training,"Proceedings of 2015 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition, ICWAPR 2015",22.0,39-44,1of1,2015,IEEE Computer Society,International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition,"Hebei University; Hebei University IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society; Hebei University SMC TC on Computational Intelligence; Hebei University SMC TC on Intelligent Internet Systems; Hebei University SMC TC on Machine Learning; Hebei University SMC TC on Pattern Recognition",Local operator estimation for single-image super-resolution,,High resolution image - Learning process - Local regression - Low resolution images - Manifold learning - Single images - State-of-the-art performance - Structure information,2015-October,

Comput Ind Eng,"Abstract Preference relations are a powerful quantitative decision approach that assists decision makers in expressing their preferences over alternatives. In real-life applications, decision makers may not be able to provide exact preference information with crisp numbers. To solve this problem, a hesitant-intuitionistic fuzzy number (Hesitant-IFN) is proposed in this paper, and a proposal for the hesitant-intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation (Hesitant-IFPR) and its complementary form (Hesitant-IFCPR) for uncertain preference information are presented. Compared with other preference relations, the proposed relations use hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs) to express the priority intensities of decision makers and produce the corresponding non-priority intensities by a conversion formula. In addition, we have deduced the operational laws and comparative methods of Hesitant-IFNs and used such information to investigate the corresponding aggregation operators and the approximate consistency tests. Next, we have constructed a group decision-making approach under a hesitant-intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Finally, two case studies are presented to illustrate the preference relations, the approximate consistency tests and the group decision method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152200883656,4018.0,"Zhou, Wei (1, 2); Xu, Zeshui (2); Chen, Minghui (1) ","(1) International Business School, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming; 650221, China (2) Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610064, China ",CINDDL,912.2 Management,,,,,Fuzzy sets - Mathematical operators,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xu, Zeshui ",10.1016/j.cie.2015.04.020,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014Z100, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2014HB014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61273209, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 71301141, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The authors would like to thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive suggestions that have led to this improved version of the paper.

In order to eliminate the response difference of the charge readout from the RPCs, a calibration procedure is carried out with the iso-gradient method. This method also allows the extension of the absolute calibration with the muon telescope including scintillation detectors to all the RPCs in the array.

Diangong Jishu Xuebao,"High temperature seriously threatens the security and the stability of the dry-type air-core reactor operation. In this paper, concerning its extreme high voltage and strong magnetic field environment, the temperature monitoring for the 35 kV dry-type air-core reactor under the working condition using embedded (fiber Bragg grating) FBG is implemented. An optical FBG temperature sensor with the characteristics of simple structure, small volume, and electromagnetic interference resistance is developed. The sensor is then buried in the lead sealing surface casing between two adjacent ventilation bars. The distance to the top of the reactor is about 40 cm. The temperature experimental results show that, after reaching steady state, the temperature of the inner conductor layer and the outer conductor layer are relatively low, about 82 and 72 respectively, and the temperatures in the middle are distributed between 90 and 100. The highest temperature of the conductor layer 6 is about 100. The designed embedded optical FBG temperature sensor is stable and reliable, with high precision and electromagnetic interference resistance. It can realize the on-line temperature monitoring in the extreme environment for 35 kV dry-type air-core reactors, and is vital to maintain the security and stability of the power grid. ©, 2015, Chinese Machine Press.

This paper presents two color calibration methods based on excluding isolated pixels with brightness distortion under laß color space. The experimental results show that the methods can obtain better brightness and color uniformity, as well as make the histograms of corrected images in three channels get closer to normal distribution. Among them, the maximum isolated degree removal method can obtain higher richness of color, and the brightest - the darkest isolated pixels removal method can make the corrected image has higher similarity with the original image.

Gongcheng Lixue,"The large eddy simulation (LES) method base on a Vreman subgrid-scale model and the slide mesh technology of CFD were applied to accurately capture the flowing character in the Francis turbine passage under a small opening condition. Pressure distributions, velocity and vorticity as well as some special flow structures in guide vane near-wall zones and blade passages were gained. The results show that the tangential velocity component of fluid is dominant under a small opening condition. This situation aggravates the interactions between the wake vortices that shed from guide vanes. It leads to strong and complicated turbulent motion and all kinds of hydraulic instability phenomenon. There exists a pressure pulsation with a consistent low frequency, and main frequency energy in each flow passage parts from a spiral case to a runner computational domain, inducing the swirl vortex in a blade passage. Thusly, the non-uniform flow around a guide vane combined with the transmission of stress wave has a critical influence on the balance of a turbine and blade unit. In addition, the inter-Blade vortex is the main factor of blade fatigue failure. ©, 2015, Tsinghua University.

Rock Soil Mech,"In order to study seepage mechanism of soil, there are some basic assumptions, the soil is saturated, and flow is laminar in the process of seepage. Based on lattice Boltzmann method at the representative elementary volume(REV) scale, the mesoscopic seepage numerical model of soil under pressure is established, considering the effects of macroscopic statistical parameters, i.e. porosity, permeability and effective viscosity coefficient. The D2Q9 model is applied for the discrete velocity direction. In the macroscopic boundary condition, it is impermeable in the left and right sides; and it is controlled by pressure in the upper and lower boundaries, which is decided by setting different density. And the non- equilibrium extrapolation scheme is used in the microscopic boundary. The porous media is set to be fluid in the study region by letting φ=1.0 and K=∞, the corresponding program is compiled to verify the Poiseuille flow. Combined with an example, the influence of porosity, permeability and seepage pressure on the seepage velocity driven by pressure is discussed for soil, and the results of this paper are in good agreement with that calculated by Darcy's law. Therefore, lattice Boltzmann method at the REV scale could effectively simulate the seepage characteristics of soil, and it provides a new research approach for further study of seepage mechanism. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

IOP Conf. Ser. Earth Environ. Sci.,"The failure of rock joints is one of the potential causes for the local and general rock instability, which may trigger devastating geohazards such as landslide. In this paper, the Distinct Element Method (DEM) featured by a novel bond contact model was utilized to simulate shear behaviour of centre/non-coplanar rock joints. The DEM results show that the complete shear behaviour of jointed rock includes four stages: elastic shearing phase, crack propagation, the failure of rock bridges and the through-going discontinuity. The peak shear strength of centre joint increases as the joint connectivity rate decreases. For intermittent noncoplanar rock joints, as the inclination of the rock joints increases, its shear capacity decreases when the inclination angle is negative while increase when positive. Comparison with the experimental results proves the capability of this DEM model in capturing the mechanical properties of the jointed rocks. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Open Access,20154601542855,12021.0,"Jiang, M.J.

J Appl Phys,"We present a theoretical study on plasmon-polariton modes in graphene placed inside an optical cavity and driven by a source-to-drain electric field. The electron velocity and electron temperature are determined by solving self-consistently the momentum- and energy-balance equations in which electron interactions with impurities, acoustic-, and optic-phonons are included. Based on many-body self-consistent field theory, we develop a tractable approach to study plasmon-polariton in an electron gas system. We find that when graphene is placed inside a Fabry-Pérot cavity, two branches of the plasmon-polariton modes can be observed and these modes are very much optic- or plasmon-like. The frequencies of these modes depend markedly on driving electric field especially at higher resonant frequency regime. Moreover, the plasmon-polariton frequency in graphene is in terahertz (THz) bandwidth and can be tuned by changing the cavity length, gate voltage, and driving electric field.

Xiyou Jinshu,"Molybdenum is an important strategic metal. Currently, molybdenum ore resources in China are becoming shortage increasingly as the continuous exploitation of mines and the increasing demand for molybdenum. Therefore, low-grade molybdenum will become the key object of exploitation, and the economic development and reasonable utilization of it will become the focus of research. According to the characteristics and the properties of low-grade molybdenum ore, such as low grade and high gangue content, the process of low-temperature roasting by sodium carbonate was used, and the molybdate generated during roasting could dissolve into water by leaching method, realizing the separation from gangue minerals. The results of thermodynamic analysis showed that when the temperature was in the range of 523~873 K, the Gibbs free energy of molybdate formation was less than 0, and the formation trend detracted with the temperature increasing gradually. In addition, the reaction activity of silica and alumina was very low. The effects and regulation of powder particle size, roasting temperature, roasting time and the mass ratio of alkali to ore on the conversion of molybdenum and the control of impurity silicon introduction were investigated. Through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of ore samples, clinker and leaching residue, the transformation process of molybdenum were studied. The results showed that under the roasting conditions of ore particle size of 80~96 μm, roasting temperature of 550, roasting time of 3 h and the alkali/ore mass ratio of 2, the conversion rates of molybdenum and silicon reached 93.9% and less than 1.3%, respectively. It would provide theoretical guidance and technical reference for the development and the utilization of low-grade molybdenum ore. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

Nanoscale Res. Lett.,"Er3+-doped CdS nanoribbons (Er-CdS NRs) are synthesized by thermal evaporation and then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photoluminescence (PL), and absorption spectra. The Er-CdS NR photodetector is studied systematically, including spectral response, light intensity response, and photoconductance (G) versus temperature (T). It is found that Er-CdS NR has the ability of detecting multicolor light including blue, red, and near-infrared light with higher responsivity (Rλ) and external quantum efficiency (η). The conductance of Er-CdS NR under dark conditions decreases with increasing temperature in the range of 87–237 K, while its conductance increases with increasing temperature in the range of 237–297 K when T is larger than 237 K. These results indicated that ionized impurities and the intrinsic excitation are responsible for the conductance change of Er-CdS NR in the dark. The superior performance of the Er-CdS NR device offers an avenue to develop highly sensitive multicolor photodetector applications. © 2015, Dedong et al.",,Open Access,20153001059621,285.0,"Dedong, Hou (1, 2, 3); Ying-Kai, Liu (1, 2, 3); Yu, De-Peng (3, 4) ","(1) Institute of Physics and Electronic Information, Yunnan Normal University, No. 768 Juxian Street, Chenggong New District, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Key Laboratory of Yunnan Higher Education Institutes for Optoelectric Information & Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (3) Key Laboratory of Yunnan Normal University for Photoelectric Materials & Device, Kunming; 650500, China (4) State Key Laboratory for Mesoscopic Physics, Department of Physics, Peking University, No. 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing; 100871, China ",,641.1 Thermodynamics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 813.2 Coating Materials - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Cadmium sulfide - Enamels - Field emission microscopes - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - II-VI semiconductors - Infrared devices - Nanoribbons - Photodetectors - Photons - Scanning electron microscopy - Temperature - Thermal evaporation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ying-Kai, Liu(liuyingkai99@163.com) ",10.1186/s11671-015-0975-3,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1556276X,,,,19317573,1,"December 23, 2015",English,Erbium compounds,,32.0,,,2015,Springer New York LLC,Nanoscale Research Letters,,Multicolor Photodetector of a Single Er3+-Doped CdS Nanoribbon,,Dark conditions - External quantum efficiency - Field emission scanning electron microscopy - Increasing temperatures - Ionized impurities - Near infrared light - Photoconductance - Spectral response,10,
Soft Comput.,"In time-series environments, uncertain knowledge among variables in a time slice can be represented and modeled by a Bayesian network (BN). In this paper, we are to achieve the global uncertain knowledge during a period of time for decision-making or action selection by fussing or combining the participating uncertainties of multiple time slices consistently while satisfying the demands of high efficiency and instantaneousness. We adopt qualitative probabilistic network (QPN), the qualitative abstraction of BN, as the underlying framework of modeling and fusing time-series uncertain knowledge. The BNs in continuous time slices constitute time-series BNs, from which we derive time-series QPNs. Taking time-series BNs as input, we propose a QPN-based approach to fuse time-series uncertainties in line with temporal specialties. First, for each time slice, we enhance the implied QPN by augmenting interval-valued weights derived from the corresponding BN, and then obtain the QPN with weighted influences, denoted EQPN (Enhanced Qualitative Probabilistic Network), which provides a quantitative and conflict-free basis for fusing uncertain knowledge. Then, we give the method for fusing the graphical structures of time-series EQPNs based on the concept of Markov equivalence. Following, we give a superposition method for fusing qualitative influences of time-series EQPNs. Experimental results show that our method is not only efficient, but also effective. Meanwhile, the simulation results when applying time-series EQPNs and the fusion algorithm to a robotic system show that our method is applicable in realistic intelligent situations. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20143600021963,,"Yue, Kun (1, 2); Qian, Wenhua (1); Fu, Xiaodong (3); Li, Jin (2); Liu, Weiyi (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Key Laboratory of Software Engineering of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China (3) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China ",,"731.6 Robot Applications - 912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 932.2.1 Fission and Fusion Reactions - 961 Systems Science - 971 Social Sciences",,,,,Bayesian networks - Behavioral research - Continuous time systems - Decision making - Fusion reactions - Intelligent robots,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yue, Kun ",10.1007/s00500-014-1381-y,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14337479,,,,14327643,7,"July 11, 2015",English,Time series,,42.0,1953-1972,,2015,Springer Verlag,Soft Computing,,Qualitative probabilistic network-based fusion of time-series uncertain knowledge,,Fusion algorithms - Graphical structures - Markov equivalences - Qualitative influences - Qualitative probabilistic networks - Superposition - Superposition method - Uncertain knowledge,19,
New J. Phys.,"Quantum correlation provides a promising measure beyond entanglement. Here, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for nonzero quantum correlation in continuous variable systems, which is simple and easy to perform in terms of a marker Qr. In order to get this condition, we introduce continuous-variable local orthogonal bases of the operator space, which are generalized from the orthogonal basis sets in local operator space for discrete variables. Based on this, we obtain the marker Qrfor all bipartite continuous variable states, and provide several examples including two-mode Gaussian and non-Gaussian states. Our result may provide a candidate for quantum correlation measures, and can be measured by designed quantum circuits. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.",,Open Access,20154101377850,93007.0,"Zhang, Chengjie (1, 2); Yu, Sixia (2, 3); Chen, Qing (2, 4); Yuan, Haidong (5); Lai, C.H.

So the Dongba culture inheritance by school training mode becomes necessary. By comparing and analyzing the traditional inheritance and school training mode, we find that only by improving the training of Dongba culture school, establishing preserved areas, enhancing the current Dongba’s skills and techniques, and fully mobilizing Dongba’s enthusiasm to create a cultural inheritance atmosphere, can Dongba culture be protected better. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20160701929835,,"Kang, Hou Liang (1); Yang, Yu Ting (1); Wang, Fan (2) ","(1) Tourism and Culture College, Yunnan University, Lijing; Yunnan, China (2) Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan, China ",,912.1 Industrial Engineering,159889.0,"November 22, 2014 - November 23, 2014","Xiamen, China","International Conference on Management, Information and Educational Engineering, MIEE 2014",Industrial engineering,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781138028555.0,,,2015,English,Engineering,,10.0,1057-1061,2 of 2,2015,CRC Press/Balkema,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Management, Information and Educational Engineering, MIEE 2014",,A comparative analysis of the change in Dongba culture inheritance modes,,Basic conditions - Comparative analysis - Dongba inheritance - Inheritance change - Inheritance mode - Regional distribution - Training mode,2,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Management, Information and Educational Engineering, MIEE 2014"
J Alloys Compd,"Abstract A process of combing use of one-step spark plasma sintering (SPS) method and space holder technique was developed to have successfully fabricated the porous NiTi alloy. To optimize porous NiTi for bone implant applications, the effects of pore characteristics and microstructures on mechanical properties and superelastic behaviors of the porous NiTi alloys were investigated by varying sintering temperatures (800-1050°C) and ammonium hydrogen carbonate (NH4HCO3) contents (0-20 wt.%). The results showed that porous NiTi alloys with 18-61% porosity and 21-415 μm average pore size all consisted of nearly single NiTi phase with few undesired phases Ti2Ni and Ni3Ti. The superelastic recovery strain ratio of the porous NiTi alloy could be improved up to 90% through training, but with further increasing of training cycles, the curves showed an obvious ladder shaped stress plateau, which indicated the collapse of the pores. This enhanced superelasticity will greatly degrade the mechanical mismatch between bones and porous NiTi. Furthermore, with increasing the porosity and pore size, elastic modulus and compressive strength of the porous NiTi alloys decreased. However, the compressive strength was higher or close to those of human bone and the elastic modulus was close to those of human bone. The unique combination of inter-connected pore characteristics, pure phase composition, low elastic modulus, high strength and large superelastic recovery strain made this material a good candidate for ideal long-term load-bearing hard tissue implants. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20152100876097,34179.0,"Zhang, L.

J. Mater. Chem. B,"The natural plant cyclopeptide RA-V, which was isolated from the roots of Rubia yunnanensis, was discovered to be a novel anti-cancer candidate. However, the cyclic hexapeptide exhibited poor solubility in physiological conditions, limiting its application for cancer therapy in vivo. To solve this problem, pH-sensitive polymers were developed for targeted RA-V delivery into tumor sites and for acid-triggered drug release. The poly(β-amino ester)s (PAE) copolymers self-assembled into micelle-like nanoparticles in an aqueous solution at pH 7.4, and the solubility of RA-V was enhanced by loading the drug into the hydrophobic cores of micelles. The near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe squaraine (SQ) dye, as an imaging probe, could also be encapsulated into polymer micelles simultaneously. The diameters of the RA-V/SQ loaded micelles were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which proved that the micelles with sizes of 35-60 nm were suitable as anti-cancer drug nano-vehicles. The drug-loading capacity and drug release profiles of RA-V-loaded micelles were calculated and monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements. The RA-V/SQ loaded micelles were stable at a neutral pH, and drug release could be greatly accelerated by the acid-triggered ionization of copolymer chains. Similarly, with free RA-V cyclopeptide, the RA-V/SQ loaded micelles exhibited high anti-cancer efficiency toward MCF-7 cells and Hela cells, while the intact polymer micelles and SQ-loaded micelles are non-toxic. Moreover, the endocytosis pathway and mitochondria-regulated apoptosis of RA-V/SQ loaded micelles were proved by lysosome colocalization and JC-1 assay, respectively. Finally, biodistribution and tumor growth inhibition were evaluated in MCF-7 cell-xenografted nude mice, demonstrating that RA-V/SQ loaded micelles could realize tumor imaging and effectively and simultaneously inhibit tumor growth. Therefore, the RA-V/SQ loaded micelles may find use as potential nano-scaled cancer therapeutics and imaging agents. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20152300912160,,"Qiao, Zeng-Ying (1); Zhang, Di (1); Hou, Chun-Yuan (1); Zhao, Si-Meng (2); Liu, Ya (3); Gao, Yu-Juan (1); Tan, Ning-Hua (2); Wang, Hao (1) ","(1) CAS Key Laboratory for Biological Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNST), Beijing; 100190, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; Yunnan; 650201, China (3) College of Marine Life Science, Ocean University of China, No. 5 Yushan Road, Qingdao, China ",JMCBDV,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 602.2 Mechanical Transmissions - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801.3 Colloid Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Cell death - Controlled drug delivery - Diseases - Dynamic light scattering - High performance liquid chromatography - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Infrared devices - Molecular biology - Oncology - Polypeptides - Probes - Solubility - Solutions - Targeted drug delivery - Transmission electron microscopy - Tumors - Vehicle transmissions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tan, Ning-Hua ",10.1039/c5tb00445d,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),2050750X,,,,20507518,22,"June 14, 2015",English,Micelles,,62.0,4514-4523,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,Journal of Materials Chemistry B,,A pH-responsive natural cyclopeptide RA-V drug formulation for improved breast cancer therapy,,Cancer therapeutics - Drug loading capacity - Endocytosis pathway - Fluorescent probes - Ph sensitive polymers - Physiological condition - Polies (beta amino ester) - Triggered drug release,3,

IEC 61850 distributed architecture was adopted in the information structure to achieve standby switchover. Two-layer network was used in the communication network to implement access control and flow control. Then we designed a network topology of power transmission and transformation equipment, and used wired and wireless heterogeneous network solutions to improve the reliability of network and provide service channel for asset inspection. The results show that selecting the dual-star network redundancy scheme as the networking solution of convergence layer network can support the substation monitoring network consisting of fifteen smart sensors and three main IEDs. And the network supports the standby switchover with the switching time of less than 18s among the master IED equipment.

The structure, morphology, surface chemical state and specific surface area were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) and N2-sorption isotherm, respectively. The obtained products are anatase-type TiO2with a small grain size (7.5 ± 1.4 nm) and a high specific surface area (181.15 m2g-1). Tungsten element presents in the +6 oxidation state. The resistance-temperature measurements indicate that tungsten dopant leads to the decrease in resistance. The as-prepared pure and W-doped TiO2nanoparticles were used to fabricate gas sensor devices. Gas response toward 3000 ppm butane is increased from 6 to 17.8 through the doping of 5% tungsten. Meanwhile, the response and recovery time toward 3000 ppm butane are as fast as 2 and 12 s, respectively. Moreover, the sensor also possesses low detection limit, good linear dependence, good repeatability and long-term stability, indicating the potential of using W-doped TiO2nanoparticles for butane gas detection. In addition, a possible mechanism for the enhanced sensitivity of W-doped TiO2nanoparticles toward butane is also offered. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,20154701564989,,"Liu, Xu (1); Pan, Kaimeng (1); Wang, Lihong (1); Dong, Chengjun (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1); Wang, Yude (1, 2) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",RSCACL,543.5 Tungsten and Alloys - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 812.3 Glass - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 933 Solid State Physics - 944.6 Temperature Measurements,,,,,Butane - Chemical analysis - Doping (additives) - Gas detectors - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Nanoparticles - Sol-gel process - Sol-gels - Specific surface area - Temperature measurement - Titanium dioxide - Transmission electron microscopy - Tungsten - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy - X ray powder diffraction - X rays,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude ",10.1039/c5ra20886f,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,117,"October 30, 2015",English,Tungsten compounds,,34.0,96539-96546,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Butane detection: W-doped TiO2nanoparticles for a butane gas sensor with high sensitivity and fast response/recovery,,Enhanced sensitivity - High specific surface area - Long term stability - Low detection limit - Resistance temperature - Response and recovery time - Surface chemical state - X ray photoelectron spectra,5,
Fuel,"Abstract The concentrations and modes of occurrence of highly-elevated trace elements including V, Cr, Se, Mo, Cd, Re, and U in some late Permian coals preserved within marine carbonate successions from Southwest China, were investigated using inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), sequential chemical extraction procedures (SCEP), field emission-scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (FE SEM-EDS), and X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD). The coals present in this study are characterized by superhigh-organic-sulfur, ranging from 5.01% to 9.87%, and by highly-elevated concentrations of V (859 ppm on average), Cr (370 ppm), Se (29.3 ppm), Mo (364 ppm), Cd (3.87 ppm), Re (0.47 ppm), and U (214 ppm). The minerals in the coals are predominantly composed of illite or mixed-layer illite/smectite, which, together with quartz, were derived from sediment-source region. The SCEP results showed that elements V, Cr, Se, Re, U, and Mo are mainly associated with organic matter of the coal, and to a lesser extent, are associated with illite or mixed-layer illite/smectite. Traces of U-bearing minerals (coffinite and brannerite) were identified in the coal. Cadmium is mainly and Cr and Mo are partially distributed in sulfide minerals. A significant proportion of Re is also associated with the carbonate fraction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J. Environ. Sci.,"Currently, the Chinese central government is considering plans to build a trilateral economic sphere in the Bohai Bay area, including Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei (BTH), where haze pollution frequently occurs. To achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to understand the physical mechanism of the haze pollution there. Therefore, the pollutant transport mechanisms of a haze event over the BTH region from 23 to 24 September 2011 were studied using the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the FLEXible-PARTicle dispersion model to understand the effects of the local atmospheric circulations and atmospheric boundary layer structure. Results suggested that the penetration by sea-breeze could strengthen the vertical dispersion by lifting up the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and carry the local pollutants to the downstream areas; in the early night, two elevated pollution layers (EPLs) may be generated over the mountain areas: the pollutants in the upper EPL at the altitude of 2-2.5. km were favored to disperse by long-range transport, while the lower EPL at the altitude of 1. km may serve as a reservoir, and the pollutants there could be transported downward and contribute to the surface air pollution. The intensity of the sea-land and mountain-valley breeze circulations played an important role in the vertical transport and distribution of pollutants. It was also found that the diurnal evolution of the PBLH is important for the vertical dispersion of the pollutants, which is strongly affected by the local atmospheric circulations and the distribution of urban areas. © 2015 .",,,20151500734529,,"Miao, Yucong (1); Liu, Shuhua (1); Zheng, Yijia (1); Wang, Shu (1); Chen, Bicheng (2); Zheng, Hui (1, 3); Zhao, Jingchuan (1, 4) ","(1) Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Department of Meteorology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park; PA; 16802, United States (3) Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100029, China (4) Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 451 Air Pollution - 481.1 Geology - 631.1 Fluid Flow, General",,,,,Atmospheric boundary layer - Atmospheric movements - Atmospheric structure - Boundary layer flow - Climatology - Landforms - Weather forecasting,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Shuhua(lshuhua@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.jes.2014.08.025,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18787320,"Number: 41175004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: GYHY201106033, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41175004 ) and the China Meteorological Administration Special Public Welfare Research Fund (No. GYHY201106033 ).,,10010742,,"April 1, 2015",English,Air pollution,,35.0,9-20,,2015,"Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O.

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"Because of the contradiction of more people and less land, combining with the threat of land degradation and pollution, land consolidation has become the main way resolving these problems. In the end of 1990's, China issued Land Administration Law, which meant that land development, land arrangement and land reclamation had been promoted to law level and showed the government's attention to land consolidation. At present, ecological civilization has been treated as the national strategy, which needs system framework for land consolidation designed at top level including quantity control, quality management and ecology protection. Unfortunately, a systematic and scientific land consolidation system has not been established on account of theory research work falling behind application work. This paper compared the content, importance and framework level of land consolidation system and land scientific system based on the overseas and domestic research status. Starting from the logic view of land use and cognition, which manifested the procedure of needing land, understanding land, controlling land, fearing land and sustainably using land, the system was divided into the core layer, the supporting layer and the criterion layer. The core layer consisted of technology, theory and discipline. The technology and theory could set up the discipline, while the discipline could accelerate the development of the former two. The supporting layer consisted of management and culture, which could facilitate each other. The criterion layer was land consolidation law, which was treated as a basic standard and guideline for the other systems. It presented the method and principle of how to establish the system framework according to the theory of system engineering and statistics. The results showed that land consolidation system was composed of 6 contents including technology system, theoretical system, disciplinary system, management system, cultural system and legal system. Firstly, land consolidation technology system was the core, which included region classification, investigation, land planning, engineer designation, engineering construction, evaluation, information, technology criterion. Secondly, land consolidation theory system was the basis, which included basic theory, methodology and application. Thirdly, land consolidation discipline system was the impetus, which included major cultivation, personnel training, platform construction, communication and cooperation. Fourthly, land consolidation management system was the main body, which included management object, management subject and management rule. Fifthly, land consolidation cultural system was the soul, which included material culture, spiritual culture and rule culture. Last but not least, land consolidation legal system was criterion, which included law, regulation, rule, normative documentation and institution. The system had the properties of systematicness, innovation and guidance. Systematicness could reflect the attributes' characteristics and the relationship of all the sub-systems. Innovation could fill the current content of land consolidation system using culture connotation and legal criterion. Guidance meant that the technical perfection, theoretical innovation, discipline cultivation and management diversity showed the main development direction of land consolidation in the future. The new view of land consolidation system should be changed, for example, the technology system, theoretical system and discipline system could be treated as core part from only technology system and management system, while management and culture system as the supporting part, and legal system as the criterion. It can be concluded that system framework of land consolidation is a dynamic system, whose content still need to be added and amended in the future. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Wuli Xuebao,"In this paper, Er3+/Eu3+co-doped BiOCl phosphors are synthesized by the conventional solid state method at 500, which are characterized by XRD, SEM, absorption spectra, excitation spectra and emission spectra. XRD analysis indicates that the samples exhibit pure tetragonal phase BiOCl. In SEM pictures, the samples exhibit smooth plate-like particles. The absorption spectra indicate that Er3+/Eu3+ion dopants result in an impurity energy level, and the excitation spectra show that the sample has excellent broadband near ultraviolet (NUV)-exciting ability, which is due to the electronic transitions of the BiOCl bandgap. Under at 380 nm excitation, the emission bands located at 410 nm (2H9/2→4I15/2), 525 nm (2H11/2→4I15/2), 554 nm (4S3/2→4I15/2), 673 nm (4F9/2→4I15/2) of Er3+ions, and 581 nm (5D0→7F0), 594 nm (5D0→7F1), 622 nm (5D0→7F2), 653 nm (5D0→7F3), 699 nm (5D0→7F4) of Eu3+ions can be observed, respectively. Moreover, contrary to most of the Er3+/Eu3+-activated phosphors, the Er3+/Eu3+co-doped BiOCl phosphor shows the unique and effective emission of the violet (Er3+) and far-red (Eu3+), which results from the particular structure of BiOCl crystals. The tunability in color of emitted radiation has been visualized by using chromaticity diagram on changing the doping concentration. Results show that the Er3+/Eu3+co-doped BiOCl is a promising phosphor for near UV white LEDs. © 2015 Chinese Physical Society.",,,20153801295351,177803.0,"Li, Yong-Jin (1); Huang, Yang-Bin (1); Liu, Qun (2); Qiu, Jian-Bei (2); Yin, Zhao-Yi (2); Song, Zhi-Guo (2) ","(1) Yunnan Technology and Business University, Kunming; 651700, China (2) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",WLHPAR,711 Electromagnetic Waves - 741.1 Light/Optics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice,,,,,Bismuth compounds - Color - Crystal impurities - Crystal structure - Doping (additives) - Electromagnetic wave absorption - Emission spectroscopy - Excited states - Ions - Light emission - Phosphors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Zhi-Guo(songzg@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.7498/aps.64.177803,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10003290,17,"September 5, 2015",Chinese,Chlorine compounds,,23.0,,,2015,"Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica,,Color-tunableness of Er3+/Eu3+co-doped BiOCl phosphors for near ultraviolet excitation,,Chromaticity diagram - Co-doped - Color tunability - Doping concentration - Electronic transition - Excitation spectrum - Near ultraviolet excitations - Near uv,64,
"Proc. - Int. Conf. Intell. Networks Intell. Syst., ICINIS","Granules locate in the solar photosphere and are bright cellular patterns, which are surrounded by dark intergranular lanes. They are viewed to be the visible manifestation of the solar convective zone. Studying the cellular patterns is important to understand the convective motions in the solar photosphere. In this paper, we presented a new method based on phase congruency technique for identifying them. The method consists of five steps as follows. (1) Smoothing an original image with a band-pass filter. The aim is to remove the noise on the structure of the granules. (2) Obtaining phase information image of granules using several suitable parameters. (3) Obtaining a binary image for marking the granular with a threshold. (4) Extracting the shape of granules. An image processing technique, morphological filter operation is used to extract granule shapes. (5) Defining granule cells. We used a watershed technique to define the granule cells according to granule shapes. So we can obtain a binary image of granule cells in terms of granule shapes.

"Int. Conf. Fuzzy Syst. Knowl. Discov., FSKD",spatial co-locations represent the subsets of spatial features which are frequently located together in geographic space. This paper presents a new problem of finding co-locations on spatial databases which are constantly changed with new data and disappeared data. Discovering co-locations is a complicated process when a large spatial database is changed because new and disappeared data will produce and take away spatial relationships with existing data as well as themselves. The changed relationships will alter the sets of prevalent co-locations with invalidating existing co-locations and producing new co-locations. So efficient incremental mining of co-locations is very indispensable and challenging. This paper presents an algorithm and pruning strategy for efficiently incremental mining on spatial datasets and executes extensive experimental evaluation on real+synthetic data sets. © 2015 IEEE.,,,20162002385782,7382013.0,"Lu, Junli (1); Wang, Lizhen (1); Xiao, Qing (1); Shang, Yu (2) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China ",,961 Systems Science,119123.0,"August 15, 2015 - August 17, 2015","Zhangjiajie, China","12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2015",Fuzzy systems - Query languages,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Lizhen(lzhwang2005@126.com) ",10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382013,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 61262069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61472346, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported in part by grants (No. 61472346, No.61262069) National Natural Science Foundation of China",9781467376822.0,,,"January 13, 2016",English,Location,"2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2015",20.0,612-617,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2015",,Incremental mining of co-locations from spatial database,,Changed neighborhoods - Changed table instances - Co-locations - Experimental evaluation - Incremental mining - Pruning strategy - Spatial relationships - Synthetic datasets,,

Mater. Res. Innov.,"To study the effects of the blast vibration spectrum of the total charges in a hole-by-hole blasting network with surface network detonators, experiments were performed using different charges. The results were analysed based on the peak particle vibration velocity and the response rule of the main vibration frequency using the Hilbert-Huang transform methods. It was concluded that the dominant frequency of the blast vibration is concentrated in the frequency range of 10-50 Hz. With an increase in the total charge, the low frequency components of the blast frequency range of 0-10 Hz gradually increased and the main vibration frequency spectrum tended toward the low frequency region. In addition, the peak particle vibration velocity exhibited an increasing trend. With the increase of distance from the blast centre, the growth speed of the peak particle vibration velocity accelerated with the increase of the total charge. © W. S.

"Proc. IEEE Adv. Inf. Technol., Electron. Autom. Control Conf., IAEAC","This paper considers the delay-dependent stability analysis of time-varying delay systems. First of all, the previous Jensen' s like inequality is firstly improved by a new inequality which has less conservatism according to our analysis. Another remarkable approach to reduce the conservatism of stability criteria is the delay-partitioning idea, and the advantage of this method provides larger delay bounds when the delay-partitioning number increases. These technical tools allow to construct efficiently a new class of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) in practice. Combining with the new inequality and reciprocal convex approach and some other inequality techniques, the new less conservative robust stability criteria are shown in form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated by an example from the literature. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20162002375342,7428706.0,"Wang, Yanmeng (1); Xiong, Lianglin (1); Zhang, Haiyang (1) ","(1) Yunnan Minzu University, School of Mathematical Sciences, Kunming, China ",,713 Electronic Circuits - 731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 921.1 Algebra - 961 Systems Science,119925.0,"December 19, 2015 - December 20, 2015","Chongqing, China","IEEE Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IAEAC 2015",Linear matrix inequalities - Lyapunov functions - Robustness (control systems) - System stability - Time delay - Time varying control systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/IAEAC.2015.7428706,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 11461082, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","The authors thank the Editor-in-chief, associate editor and anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and valuable suggestions, which help to enrich the content and improve the quality of this paper.

Nano,"CeOx/C supported PtCu thin film catalysts were prepared by ion beam sputtering (IBS) and subsequently annealed at 400°C under vacuum environment and electrochemically dealloyed. Scanning transmission electronic microscope (STEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) characterizations show that the surface of post-processed catalyst presents nanoporous structure and has a high root mean square roughness (RMS = 13.9nm). Electrochemical measurements indicate that the post-processed PtCu-CeOx/C catalyst shows higher catalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction than pure Pt/C. While inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis displays that the platinum (Pt) loading of the post-processed PtCu-CeOx/C is 0.1192mg/cm2, decreasing by 20% compare to pure Pt/C (0.1490mg/cm2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms that the surface of post-processed PtCu-CeOx/C enrich Pt and analyzes the chemical valence of Pt element using depth profiling technology. It can be inferred that the enhancement in catalytic property is attributed to the combined action between geometric structure effect and electronic modification effect of Pt atoms from CeOxsupport. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,,20152500943118,1550082.0,"Zhao, Yumeng (1); Yang, Bin (1); Hao, Xinyu (1); Zhao, Zhijing (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650093, China ",,544.2 Copper Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 801 Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 932.3 Plasma Physics,,,,,Atomic emission spectroscopy - Atomic force microscopy - Binary alloys - Catalysts - Copper alloys - Depth profiling - Hydrogen - Inductively coupled plasma - Ion beams - Platinum - Sputtering - Thin films - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Bin(yangbin@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1142/S1793292015500824,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 20130107, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 20140161, Acronym: KUST, Sponsor: Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: 51261012, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Financial support for this work was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 51261012), Kunming University of Science and Technology Analyze Test Fund (Grant Nos. 20130107 and 20140161) and Foam Metal Materials Innovation Team Project of Kunming University of Science and Technology.",,17932920,6,"August 1, 2015",English,Catalyst activity,,25.0,,,2015,World Scientific Publishing Co.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","A facial solution combustion synthesis is reported for preparing pristine NiO and Pt-functionalized (0.5%, 1%, and 2% Pt loading) NiO. It was found that the obtained products exhibit 3D hierarchical porous structure regardless the Pt-loaded amounts due to the release of gases and the loosely packed NiO particles. Compared with the pristine NiO, the presence of Pt nanoparticles somehow affected the growth behavior of NiO around and embedded on these relatively big NiO nanoparticles in different size. The Pt-functionalized NiO based gas sensor showed lower operating temperature and substantially enhanced responses to formaldehyde, especially 1% Pt-loaded NiO. The 1% Pt-loaded NiO based gas sensor displayed a response value of 9.90 to 2000 ppm formaldehyde at 200 °C, whereas the pristine NiO based gas sensor only showed a response of 3.15 under the same conditions. The plausible explanation for the Pt-functionalized NiO based gas sensors to enhance the gas sensing performance is attributed to the role of Pt on the catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde and the increase of oxygen species quantity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc.,"Rhizoma Gastrodiae (Tianma) of different variants and different geographical origins has vital difference in quality and physiological efficacy. This paper focused on the classification and identification of Tianma of six types (two variants from three different geographical origins) using three dimensional synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-SFS) coupled with principal component analysis (PCA). 3D-SF spectra of aqueous extracts, which were obtained from Tianma of the six types, were measured by a LS-50B luminescence spectrofluorometer. The experimental results showed that the characteristic fluorescent spectral regions of the 3D-SF spectra were similar, while the intensities of characteristic regions are different significantly. Coupled these differences in peak intensities with PCA, Tianma of six types could be discriminated successfully. In conclusion, 3D-SFS coupled with PCA, which has such advantages as effective, specific, rapid, non-polluting, has an edge for discrimination of the similar Chinese herbal medicine. And the proposed methodology is a useful tool to classify and identify Tianma of different variants and different geographical origins. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Trans. ASABE,"Proper prediction of tillage force is difficult, inconvenient, and time-consuming in field work since many external factors should be taken into consideration. The need for a sound modeling technique to predict tillage force is the motivation for the present work. The finite element method (FEM) is a proven and effective approach for modeling soil-tool interaction. In this study, 3D dynamic simulation models using FEM of a conventional rotary blade were established to predict the effects of rotational speed and direction. The soil was modeled as an elastic-plastic material with elastic parameters such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and the Drucker-Prager criterion, which were obtained from triaxial tests. A general contact algorithm was used to simulate the interaction between the rotary blade and the soil. Two rotational directions and three rotational speeds were analyzed by the finite element model and experimentally verified in an indoor soil bin. A relatively good general correlation was obtained between the finite element simulation and the experimental results. The simulation and experimental results both indicated that applied torque on the rotor shaft increases with rotary speed, and the torque of up-cut rotary tillage is larger than that of down-cut tillage. © 2015 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.",,,20152000848092,,"Li, M.

ICIC Express Lett Part B Appl.,"Image quality is a characteristic of an image that measures the perceived image degradation. The study on quality measures is becoming a hot spot in the sense that they can be objectively determined in terms of deviations from the ideal models. There are several techniques and metrics (e.g., Full-Reference (FR) methods and No- Reference (NR) methods) that can be measured objectively and automatically evaluated by a computer program. In this study, we focus on the previous literature of the NR Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods because the NR IQA fulfills the requirements of actual applications and is capable of playing an important role for real-time image processing system. We concentrate more on the latest methods and their applications in recent 3 years. After a cautious investigation, we realize that the existing methods have some limitations on the multi-scale, specific requirement-based and experience-based aspects. Therefore, the method based on human perceptual features is a direction of the NR IQA future research, and the new challenges arising from real applications will promote the development of future NR IQA methods. The study not only offers a valuable reference for relative studies such as image compression, but also gives a useful guidance for future NR IQA research work. ©, 2015 ICIC Express Letters Office.All Rights Reserved.",,,20153701273811,,"Zheng, Yanfang (1); Wang, Feng (1, 2); Li, Xuebao (1) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O.Box110, Kunming, China (2) Computer Technology Application Key Lab of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, No. 727, Jingming South Road, Chenggong District, Kunming, China ",,"741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices",,,,,Image processing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,21852766,10,"September 1, 2015",English,Image quality,,23.0,2723-2728,,2015,ICIC Express Letters Office,"ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications",,The latest development of no-reference digital image quality assessment,,Image degradation - Image quality assessment (IQA) - Latest development - No references - Objective assessment - Perceptual feature - Real applications - Real-time image processing,6,
Faguang Xuebao,"Red-emitting phosphors La2Mo2O9:Eu3+and La2Mo2O9:Eu3+,W6+were synthesized by the conventional solid state method. The structure and luminescent properties of these phosphors were investigated. The results indicate that these phosphors are of single phases with cubic crystal structure. La2Mo2O9:Eu3+and La2Mo2O9:Eu3+,W6+can be efficiently excited by near ultraviolet light, and the strongest excitation peak is at 395 nm. The emission intensity of La2Mo2O9:Eu3+can be enhanced by introducing W6+ions. La1.40Eu0.60Mo1.84O9:0.16W6+exhibites the strongest red emission, which is about 1.23 times than that of La1.40Mo2O9:0.60Eu3+. The red light emitting diode (LED) was fabricated by coating InGaN chip (~395 nm emission) with the phosphor La1.40Eu0.60Mo1.84O9:0.16W6+, and red bright light could be observed from the LED.

Dianli Xitong Zidonghue,"Nowadays, a more efficient way is provided for data sharing in smart substations with the development of Ethernet technology in communication network. As a key link, a rational information network scheduling policy is particularly crucial. In view of the inadequacy of the priority scheduling strategy for smart substations, a comprehensive local area network (LAN) communication queue scheduling policy based on improved weighted fair queuing (WFQ) algorithm is proposed. As an example, a typical communication network of a smart substation is taken for illustration and the corresponding communication network model is established in OPNET. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is capable of effectively improving the delay characteristic of low priority queues while ensuring the service quality of high priority queues in emergency cases. © 2015 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.",,,20151100646772,,"Gong, Shilin (1); Wang, Chen (2); Feng, Yanzhao (1); Zhang, Zhaoyun (2); Chen, Wei (2); Zeng, Zhen (2) ","(1) Yunnan Electric Power Co.

Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"To deal with the issues remaining in existing power line signaling technique based anti-islanding protection approach for distributed generation system, this paper proposes the improved schemes for signal generation and detection. By firing the bi-directional thyristors alternately, the signal transformer can be prevented from saturation caused by one directional thyristor firing frequently and the anti-islanding detection can be speeded up by using new signal generation and detection ways. Also, the causes of signal interference were analyzed and the estimation formulas for selecting signal generator device were developed in this paper. It is verified that the detection signal and interference signal can be clearly recognized by simulation and field tests. It indicates that the goal of making detection rate doubled can be achieved without impacting stable operation for signal detection, which provides the theoretical foundation for power line signaling technique based anti-islanding protection widely used in the distributed system. © 2015 Chin.

But not all distributed targets satisfy the principle of reciprocity. Aiming to solve this problem, this paper presents a method to calibration based on reciprocity judgment of distributed targets. According to the angle between the polarization scattering matrix and the reciprocal matrix of each pixel, we select pixels with small angle as the initial reciprocity calibration samples. Then, on the basis of the coherence of targets, some pixels are selected as the final calibration samples. CECT-38 X-band fully polarimetric data were completed by combining a typical calibration algorithm and selected distributed targets using the proposed method.

Chin. Phys.,"Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites play an important role in improving the efficiency of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. In this paper, we systematically explore the efficiency-enhancing mechanism of ABX3(A = CH3NH3; B = Sn, Pb; X = Cl, Br, I) and provide the best absorber among ABX3when the organic framework A is CH3NH3by first-principles calculations. The results reveal that the valence band maximum (VBM) of the ABX3is mainly composed of anion X p states and that conduction band minimum (CBM) of the ABX3is primarily composed of cation B p states. The bandgap of the ABX3decreases and the absorptive capacities of different wavelengths of light expand when reducing the size of the organic framework A, changing the B atom from Pb to Sn, and changing the X atom from Cl to Br to I. Finally, based on our calculations, it is discovered that CH3NH3SnI3has the best optical properties and its light-adsorption range is the widest among all the ABX3compounds when A is CH3NH3. All these results indicate that the electronegativity difference between X and B plays a fundamental role in changing the energy gap and optical properties among ABX3compounds when A remains the same and that CH3NH3SnI3is a promising perovskite absorber in the high efficiency solar batteries among all the CH3NH3BX3compounds. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,20160701938193,027104,"Chen, Qing-Yuan (1); Huang, Yang (1); Huang, Peng-Ru (1); Ma, Tai (1); Cao, Chao (2); He, Yao (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Department of Physics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou; 310036, China ",,482.2 Minerals - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 702.3 Solar Cells - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 801.4.1 Electrochemistry - 921 Mathematics,,,,,Calculations - Chemical bonds - Dye-sensitized solar cells - Electronegativity - Electronic properties - Energy gap - organic-inorganic materials - Perovskite - Perovskite solar cells - Solar cells - Thermoelectricity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","He, Yao(yhe@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1088/1674-1056/25/2/027104,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20583834,,,,16741056,2,"December 20, 2015",English,Optical properties,,30.0,,,2015,Institute of Physics Publishing,Chinese Physics B,,Electronegativity explanation on the efficiency-enhancing mechanism of the hybrid inorganic-organic perovskite ABX3from first-principles study,,ABX3 - Conduction-band minimum - Electronegativity difference - First-principles calculation - Hybrid inorganic-organic - Optical and electronic properties - Organic-inorganic hybrid - Solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells,25,
IEEE Geosci. Remote Sens. Lett.,"Automatic urban area detection in remote sensing images is an important application in the field of earth observation. Most of the existing methods employ feature classifiers and thereby contain a data training process. Moreover, some methods cannot detect urban areas in complex scenes accurately. This letter proposes an automatic urban area detection method that uses multiple features that have different resolutions. First, a downsampled low-resolution image is used to segment the candidate area. After the corner points of the urban area are extracted, a weighted Gaussian voting matrix technique is employed to integrate the corner points into the candidate area. Then, the edge features and homogeneous region are extracted by using the original high-resolution image. Using these results as the input, the processes of guided filtering and contrast enhancement can finally detect accurately the urban areas. This method combines multiple features, such as corner, edge, and regional characteristics, to detect the urban areas. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better detection accuracy for urban areas than the existing algorithms. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",,,20153301177462,7128711,"Shi, Hao (1); Chen, Liang (1); Bi, Fu-Kun (2); Chen, He (1); Yu, Ying (3) ","(1) School of Information and Electronic, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing; 100081, China (2) College of Information Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing; 100144, China (3) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Classification (of information) - Edge detection - Extraction - Image segmentation - Remote sensing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/LGRS.2015.2439696,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,1545598X,9,"September 1, 2015",English,Feature extraction,,13.0,1948-1952,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,,Accurate Urban Area Detection in Remote Sensing Images,,Different resolutions - Gaussians - High resolution image - High resolution remote sensing images - Homogeneous regions - Regional characteristics - Remote sensing images - Urban areas,12,
Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng,"Due to the high melting point, excellent high temperature strength and anticorrosive property, iridium is the unique material which can be used under extremely hostile environments. However, iridium exhibits an anomalous brittle fracture behavior, a mixed brittle intergranular fracture (BIF) and brittle transgranular fracture (BTF), even though it is of face-centred cubic (fcc) crystal structure. A great deal of efforts have been made to explore the embrittlement mechanisms since the anomalous fracture behavior was recognized in 1960 s, up to now, there has not been a reasonable conclusion yet. This paper emphatically reviewed the possible embrittlement mechanism of iridium, including impurity-induced brittleness, intrinsic brittleness and special defect structure induced embrittlement, discussed the research status quo about the deformation and failure mechanisms of iridium. Finally, the research direction and research method of the embrittlement mechanism of iridium were forecasted. Copyright © 2015, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.

RSC Adv.,"Porous NiO nanosheets were self-grown on an alumina tube with a pair of Au electrodes connected by platinum wires via a simple solution combustion synthesis. A cubic NiO phase was obtained by a mixed solution of an oxidizer of nickel nitrate and a fuel of ethylene glycol (EG) at 400°C. The phases and the morphologies of the materials self-grown on an alumina tube were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the alumina tube was entirely covered by NiO nanosheets with several micrometers in thickness. The NiO nanosheets on the surface of the tube were assembled by a large number of nanoparticles of irregular shapes and pores with different sizes. The electronic and gas-sensing characteristics of the self-grown porous NiO nanosheets for volatile organic compound (VOC) vapours (ethanol, acetone, methanol, and formaldehyde) were investigated. The resistance of the sensor directly based on the self-grown NiO dramatically drops from 100-240°C, and then slightly decreases with further increasing temperature to about 28 kU at 400°C. The sensor based on the self-grown NiO exhibits low detection limit, fast response and recovery and wide dynamic range detection to VOC vapours, especially ethanol, at the respectively optimal operating temperatures. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20145200378538,,"Dong, Chengjun (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1); Chen, Gang (1); Guan, Hongtao (1); Wang, Yude (1); Djerdj, Igor (2) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) RuCrossed D Signer Bokovi Institute, Bijenika 54, Zagreb; 10000, Croatia ",RSCACL,"619.1 Pipe, Piping and Pipelines - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 642.1 Process Heating - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements - 943.3 Special Purpose Instruments",,,,,Acetone - Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Chemical detection - Combustion synthesis - Ethanol - Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Gas detectors - Gas sensing electrodes - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Nanosheets - Scanning electron microscopy - Temperature - Thickness measurement - Transmission electron microscopy - Tubes (components) - Volatile organic compounds - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude ",10.1039/c4ra13025a,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,7,2015,English,Nickel oxide,,29.0,4880-4885,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Porous NiO nanosheets self-grown on alumina tube using a novel flash synthesis and their gas sensing properties,,Gas sensing characteristics - Gas sensing properties - Increasing temperatures - Low detection limit - Operating temperature - Solution combustion synthesis - Volatile organic compound (VOC) - Wide dynamic range,5,

This work attempts to figure out microwave oxidation process of high titanium slag. Based on a through analysis, it can be concluded that high titanium slag phase transformation process under microwave field can be divided into four stages: (i) crystallization of amorphous Fe, Mg, and Ti oxides, (ii) decomposition of Fe0.5Mg0.5Ti2O5, (iii) oxidation of (Mg0.15Ti1.85)O5and FeTi2O5, and (iv) transformation of A-TiO2, which is totally from the reaction process (M3O5→ A-TiO2→ R-TiO2) under conventional resistance heating condition. In addition, when amorphous Fe, Mg, and Ti oxides crystallize, the Raman active vibration modes first was assigned to A-TiO2lattice, then dominated by R-TiO2lattice.

Front. Comput. Sci.,"Open and dynamic environments lead to inherent uncertainty of Web service QoS (Quality of Service), and the QoS-aware service selection problem can be looked upon as a decision problem under uncertainty. We use an empirical distribution function to describe the uncertainty of scores obtained from historical transactions. We then propose an approach to discovering the admissible set of services including alternative services that are not dominated by any other alternatives according to the expected utility criterion. Stochastic dominance (SD) rules are used to compare two services with uncertain scores regardless of the distribution form of their uncertain scores. By using the properties of SD rules, an algorithm is developed to reduce the number of SD tests, by which the admissible services can be reported progressively. We prove that the proposed algorithm can be run on partitioned or incremental alternative services. Moreover, we achieve some useful theoretical conclusions for correct pruning of unnecessary calculations and comparisons in each SD test, by which the efficiency of the SD tests can be improved. We make a comprehensive experimental study using real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed algorithm. © 2014, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20150300431752,,"Fu, Xiaodong (1); Yue, Kun (2); Liu, Li (1); Zou, Ping (3); Feng, Yong (1) ","(1) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Technology Application, Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Faculty of Management and Economics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",,"913.1 Production Engineering - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 922.1 Probability Theory - 961 Systems Science",,,,,Distribution functions - Efficiency - Quality of service - Set theory - Stochastic systems - Websites,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Fu, Xiaodong ",10.1007/s11704-014-4059-9,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20952236,,,,20952228,2,2015,English,Web services,,41.0,265-279,,2015,Higher Education Press,Frontiers of Computer Science,,Discovering admissible Web services with uncertain QoS,,Admissible set - Decision problems - Dynamic environments - Empirical distribution functions - Partial preferences - QoS (quality of service) - Service selection - Stochastic Dominance,9,
RSC Adv.,"A series of novel (±)-3-substituted fluorene-imidazolium/triazolium salt derivatives has been prepared and evaluated in vitro against a panel of human tumor cell lines. The results suggest that the existence of 2-methyl-benzimidazole or 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole rings and substitution of the imidazolyl/triazolyl-3/4-position with a naphthylacyl or 4-methoxyphenacyl group were important for modulating cytotoxic activity. Compounds 37 and 42 were found to be the most potent derivatives with IC50values of 0.51-2.51 μM and exhibited cytotoxic activities selectively against myeloid leukaemia (HL-60), liver carcinoma (SMMC-7721) and lung carcinoma (A549). Compound 37 can remarkably induce the G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells.

Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng,"We conducted a theoretical study on magneto-optical (MO) properties of cylindrical metallic nanowires. The MO conductivity was calculated using the Kubo formula. Results show that in contrast to parabolically confined quantum wires realized from low-dimensional semiconductor systems, the features of MO absorption and the retard effect of the MO response by cylindrical metallic nanowires depend sensitively on the polarization of the radiation field due to corresponding selection rules. The frequencies of resonant absorption induced by inter-subband MO transition channels are within the terahertz (THz) bandwidth and can be tuned effectively by adjusting the radius of the nanowire and/or varying the strength of the magnetic field. This study is pertinent to the potential application of metallic nanowires as frequency-tunable THz optoelectronic devices. Copyright © 2015, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.

Rev. Sci. Instrum.,"An improved active imaging method, which upgraded the detection sensitivity by applying an auxiliary sawtooth wave light signal, was reported. Nevertheless, such method sacrificed the imaging speed. To speed up imaging, a sinusoidal light signal is used instead and superposed with the undetectable low-light-level signal on the image sensor. After acquiring a superimposed image set in one sine wave cycle, an unbiased low-light-level image estimation is obtained by using least-square optimization. Through probabilistic analysis and experimental study, we demonstrate that the sinusoidal signal could improve the detection sensitivity 1/3 faster than the sawtooth wave signal. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,,20152600976971,066104,"Tang, Hongying (1); Yu, Zhengtao (1) ","(1) Key Lab of Computer Technologies Application of Yunnan Province, School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",RSINAK,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",,,,,Image acquisition,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Zhengtao ",10.1063/1.4922886,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10897623,,,,00346748,6,"June 1, 2015",English,Image enhancement,,7.0,,,2015,American Institute of Physics Inc.,Review of Scientific Instruments,,Note: Improving low-light-level image detection sensitivity with higher speed using auxiliary sinusoidal light signal,,Detection sensitivity - Least square optimization - Low light level - Low-light-level image - Probabilistic analysis - Saw-tooth waves - Sinusoidal signals - Superimposed images,86,
IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech.,"The dual wavelength linearization (DWL) technique using two lasers with different wavelengths is for the first time comprehensively studied theoretically and experimentally to improve output signal power and suppress second- and third-order nonlinearities in radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems using an electro-absorption modulator (EAM). Spurious-free dynamic ranges (SFDRs) are calculated and measured. Both the calculation and experiments show that not only the RF signal power is significantly increased, but also both the second- and third-, as well as fifth-order nonlinearities are suppressed. For our considered EAM, when the second-order nonlinearity is suppressed maximally, the SFDRs with respect to second-order harmonic distortion and second-order intermodulation distortion are improved by 11.5 and 8.5 dB, respectively. In the mean time, the SFDRs with respect to third-order harmonic distortion (HD3) and third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) are improved by 1.8 and 1.3 dB, respectively. When the third order is suppressed maximally, the SFDRs with respect to HD3 and IMD3 are improved by 8.1 and 20.4 dB, respectively. The fifth-order intermodulation distortion is also suppressed at the same time. The RoF transmissions for WiFi signals are also verified. As a result, 3.5 dB at 2.4-GHz improvement and 2.8 dB at 5-GHz improvement of error vector magnitude are obtained for an RoF system by using the DWL technique. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",,,20153301175749,7134812,"Zhu, Ran (1, 2); Shen, Dongya (1); Zhang, Xiupu (1, 2); Liu, Taijun (3) ","(1) ICom Laboratories, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China (2) IPhotonics Laboratories, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal; QC; H3G 1M8, Canada (3) School of Information Science and Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo; Zhejiang; 315211, China ",IETMAB,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 717.1 Optical Communication Systems - 717.2 Optical Communication Equipment - 741.1.2 Fiber Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems,,,,,Electroabsorption modulators - Harmonic distortion - Intermodulation - Intermodulation distortion - Linearization - Optical fiber communication - Optical fibers - Radio communication,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TMTT.2015.2446469,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,00189480,8,"August 1, 2015",English,Radio-over-fiber,,18.0,2692-2702,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques,,Analysis of Dual Wavelength Linearization Technique for Radio-Over-Fiber Systems with Electro-Absorption Modulator,,Electro absorption modulator(EAM) - Fifth order nonlinearity - Radio over fiber system - Second order intermodulation - Second-order nonlinearity - Spurious free dynamic range - Third order intermodulation distortion - Third-order non-linearity,63,

After the most left picture is selected by artificial intervention, we can machine, automatic mosaic, get a complete restored image. Second, both longitudinal and transverse situation: We read the pictures’ image pixels, in accordance with the conditions that the left column or right column of the pixels are all 0, combine it with artificial intervention that find the left and right’s boundary fragments; all the pictures are to be horizontal projection and binaryzation, extract the row height characteristics of the fragments’ texts, According to the characteristics and the left or right border fragments, the fragments are classified by the classification results; According to the method of the first step, the horizontal strip of papers are around top to bottom to splice, get the complete restored image.

Neurocomputing,"Co-training is one of the major semi-supervised learning paradigms in which two classifiers are alternately trained on two distinct views and they teach each other by adding the predictions of unlabeled data to the training set of the other view. Co-training can achieve promising performance, especially when there is only a small number of labeled data. Hence, co-training has received considerable attention, and many variant co-training algorithms have been developed. It is essential and informative to provide a systematic framework for a better understanding of the common properties and differences in these algorithms. In this paper, we propose a general framework for co-training according to the diverse learners constructed in co-training. Specifically, we provide three types of co-training implementations, including co-training on multiple views, co-training on multiple classifiers, and co-training on multiple manifolds. Finally, comprehensive experiments of different methods are conducted on the UCF-iPhone dataset for human action recognition and the USAA dataset for social activity recognition.

"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf. Big Data Cloud Comput., BDCloud","With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, more and more legacy applications and systems are migrated to clouds, for clouds offer high scalability, stability and low maintenance nature. Meanwhile, since applications are distributed in clouds, reliability and response time of applications could not be guaranteed. To solve the problem, an optimization framework, FLCloud, based on PageRank algorithm is proposed for application migration and remigration. In the algorithm, application structure information, failure rate and statistical response time are considered for the selection of top k components, namely, Web services of applications. Fault tolerance strategy and location modification for these components can improve the whole application reliability and reduce response time of these critical components to enhance user experiences.

By focusing on the light characteristics of the BFOG resonator, we derive a recursive relationship for the intensity of light of different orders by using the coupled equations for stimulated Brillouin scattering. We then establish mathematical models of the light characteristics, threshold power analysis, and optimum resonance condition analysis. Based on these models, we derive a functional relationship between the incident pump light intensity, light intensity in the cavity, the intensity of each Stokes wave order, and emitted light intensity. Finally, we simulate and quantify the threshold power and resonance critical condition influenced by several main factors including the insertion loss, coupling coefficient, and transmission loss. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Electrochim Acta,"Abstract A simple, signal-off and reusable electrochemical biosensor was developed for sensitive and selective detection of mercury(II) based on thymine-mercury(II)-thymine (T-Hg2+-T) complex and the remarkable difference in the affinity of graphene with double strand DNA (ds-DNA) and single strand DNA (ss-DNA). Our system was composed of ferrocene-tagged probe DNA and graphene. Due to the noncovalent assembly, the ferrocene-tagged probe ss-DNA was immobilized on the surface of graphene nanosheets directly and employed to amplify the electrochemical signal. In the presence of Hg2+, the ferrocene-labeled T-rich DNA probe hybridized with target probe to form ds-DNA via the Hg2+-mediated coordination of T-Hg2+-T base pairs. As a result, the duplex DNA complex kept away from the graphene surface due to the weak affinity of graphene and ds-DNA, and the redox current decreased substantially. Meanwhile, the graphene decorated GCE surface was released for the reusability. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed sensor showed a linear concentration range from 25 pM to 10 μM with a detection limit of 5 pM for Hg2+detection. The strategy afforded exquisite selectivity for Hg2+against other metal ions in real environmental samples. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Vacuum,"Porous Ti with 38-56% porosity and 50-500 μm pore size was prepared by one-step spark plasma sintering (SPS) method using modified mold combined with space holder (ammonium hydrogen carbonate, NH4HCO3) technique. Pore characteristics and mechanical behaviors of porous Ti were investigated by varying sintering temperatures (1000-1200 °C). Results showed that porous Ti prepared by SPS had large plasticity and the compressive cyclic stress-strain curves showed nonlinear recovery and hysteresis effect. With the sintering temperature increasing, smooth and dense pore walls, and relatively isotropic pore surface of porous Ti were obtained, the elastic modulus and compressive strength increased. The recoverable strain ratio of porous Ti after five cycles could reach more than 70% at the pre-strain of 2%. When temperature was 1200 °C, the good combination of interconnected pore characteristics, proper elastic modules (11.2 GPa, close to that of human bones), higher compressive strength (287 MPa) and stable recoverable behaviors of porous Ti, made this material possible to be used for load-bearing hard tissue implants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Appl Surf Sci,"We report the fabrication of hierarchically microstructured flower-like ZnO by a facile and single-step procedure involving poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPSA) assisted aqueous chemical method. The shapes and sizes can be controlled just by varying the concentrations of the water-soluble polymer. When a suitable PAMPAS concentration was utilized, uniform well-defined and mono-dispersed chrysanthemum-like ZnO microstructures based on nanorod building blocks were obtained. The formation mechanism of the hierarchical structure was presented. The structured studies using XRD, HRTEM and SAED reveal these ZnO nanorods are composed of a single phase nature with wurtzite structure and grow along with the c-axis. FTIR spectrum indicated the incorporation of a trace of PAMPSA into ZnO crystals. HRTEM, Raman and XPS analyses showed that the hierarchical ZnO microstructures contain high concentration of oxygen vacancies which enable them exhibiting a significant intense deep-level emission centered at green luminescence in its photoluminescence spectra. They also show enhanced photocatalytic efficiency in degradation of methylene blue. It is hoped that the present work may provide a simple method to fabricate ZnO hierarchical microstructures and a positive relationship among polar plane, oxygen vacancy and green emission. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Food Res. Int.,"Anthocyanins, a group of polyphenolic pigments, have been proved to possess various bioactivities. However, they are unstable in the small intestine and absorbed with low bioavailability. The discrepancy between the low bioavailability of anthocyanins and their good bioactivities has not been illuminated yet. Moreover, information about the digested property and stability of purple rice anthocyanins in the alimentary tract is still limited. Thus, the present work was designed to study the digestion property and the changes in antioxidant and cytoprotective activities of purple rice anthocyanins using an in vitro digestion model, and to investigate the interactions between gastric and intestinal digested anthocyanins. The results showed that anthocyanins amount and antioxidant and cytoprotective effects didn't change significantly during gastric digestion. However, about 76% of total anthocyanins were degraded during intestinal digestion. The IC50values of intestinal digested sample tested by DPPH and ABTS methods were about 19.1 and 16.9μg/mL, respectively, far higher than that of non-digested sample (about 7.7 and 7.1μg/mL, respectively). Cytoprotective effect of intestinal digested sample also decreased significantly. Synergistic effects on antioxidant and cytoprotective activities were observed between the gastric and intestinal digested samples at a relative low concentration. Those results suggest that the bioactivities of purple rice anthocyanins may be changed after digestion and enhanced through the synergies between their gastric and intestinal digested catabolites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20155001669049,,"Sun, Dan (1); Huang, Shiqi (1); Cai, Shengbao (1); Cao, Jianxin (1); Han, Peng (1) ","(1) Yunnan Institute of Food Safety, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan Province; 650500, China ",FORIEU,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Antioxidants - Bioactivity,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cai, Shengbao(caikmust2013@163.com) ",10.1016/j.foodres.2015.10.029,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18737145,"Number: 14118781, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Candidate Talents Training Fund of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FB120, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31401503, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31401503 ), Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 2014FB120 ) and the Talent Cultivation Project of Yunnan Province (Grant No. 14118781 ).",,09639969,,"December 01, 2015",English,Anthocyanins,,44.0,114-123,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Food Research International,,Digestion property and synergistic effect on biological activity of purple rice (Oryza sativa L.) anthocyanins subjected to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion in vitro,,Cytoprotective activities - Cytoprotective effects - Gastrointestinal digestion - In-vitro - In-vitro digestions - Intestinal digestion - Purple rice - Synergistic effect,78,
J Mater Res,"In the present work, Cu-Al alloys were processed by surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) under both room and liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) conditions. In contrast to room temperature (RT) SMAT, dynamic recovery and recrystallization were largely suppressed during the LNT process. A gradient microstructure was obtained due to the gradient strain and strain rate impacted onto the sample. Microhardness measurement showed that the hardness values gradually decreased from the top surface to the central region. The local hardness of the top surface layer of the LNT and RT SMAT Cu-4.5% Al samples reached maximum values of 1.52 and 1.28 GPa, respectively. The Cu-4.5% Al alloy exhibited an improved yield strength of ∼496 MPa and a higher ductility (compared with literature data of Cu-Al alloys synthesized traditional severe plastic deformation methods) of 15.4% after the LNT SMAT process. A brittle-ductile failure pattern was easily distinguished after fracture. Moreover, the LNT SMAT is a low-cost process with high productivity and can be applied to various types of metallic production.

Nonlinear Anal Theory Methods Appl,"Abstract In this paper, by introducing a two-parameter flux approximation including pressure in the Euler equations for nonisentropic compressible fluids, we analyze the phenomena of concentration and cavitation in Riemann solutions. It is rigorously proved that, as the double parameter flux perturbation vanishes, any Riemann solution containing two shock waves and a possibly one-contact-discontinuity tends to a delta shock solution to the transport equations, and the intermediate density between the two shocks tends to a weighted δ-measure which forms the delta shock wave; any Riemann solution containing two rarefaction waves and a possibly one-contact-discontinuity tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the transport equations, and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state. Some numerical results are also given to present the processes of concentration and cavitation as the flux perturbation decreases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152200901959,10515,"Yang, Hanchun (1); Liu, Jinjing (1) ","(1) Department of Mathematics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",NOANDD,"631.1.1 Liquid Dynamics - 633 Vacuum Technology - 723.5 Computer Applications - 921 Mathematics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids",,,,,Cavitation - Computational fluid dynamics - Computer simulation - Euler equations - Shock waves - Vacuum,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Hanchun ",10.1016/j.na.2015.05.002,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,0362546X,,"June 1, 2015",English,Transport properties,,33.0,158-177,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,"Nonlinear Analysis, Theory, Methods and Applications",,Concentration and cavitation in the Euler equations for nonisentropic fluids with the flux approximation,,Compressible fluids - Contact discontinuities - Delta-shocks - Intermediate densities - Intermediate state - Nonisentropic - Riemann problem - Transport equation,123-124,

Xiyou Jinshu Cailiao Yu Gongcheng,"Silver copper oxide composites were prepared by the in-situ synthesized method. The relationship between the number of tests and the contact resistance under different conditions of DC arc were studied by a contact resistance parameter tester. The sample surface morphology changes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the contact resistance of AgCuO electrical contact material presents an elevated trend in the early time, then decreases at a certain number of test times and reaches a saturation value at last. In the experiment, the contact resistance of AgCuO electrical contact material decreases as the test current increases. When the current reaches 25 A, the contact resistance of AgCuO electrical contact materials exhibits the lowest value, and with the increase in the number of tests, the contact resistance changes a little, the material exhibits excellent stability in contact resistance. By analyzing the contact morphology features after arc erosion, it is found that there are obvious differences between the anode and the cathode contact surface morphology, the surface of the anode showing a concave convex shape with some cracks and pores and the cathode contact surface showing paste peak. ©, 2015, Rare Metals Materials and Engineering Press.

Energy Convers. Manage.,"A solar hot water driven solid adsorption ice-making system with heat storage was designed and constructed. The finned-tube absorbent bed in the water tank, which also acted as heat storage unit, was heated by the hot water from the solar vacuum tube collector in desorption process. The water in the tank was also auxiliary heated by electric heater to keep at the set desorption temperature. Activated carbon-methanol was utilized as the working pairs in the system. Effects of heat source temperature on system performance were experimentally investigated under four conditions: maintaining the water temperature in the tank at 94 °C (boiling point), 85 °C, 75 °C, respectively, and heating the water to reach 94 °C then naturally cooling the hot water without maintaining heating in desorption process. The experimental results showed that the temperatures around the finned-tube of the adsorbent bed was homogeneous, which was beneficial for desorption of the adsorbate. The maximum daily ice-making capacity of 8.4 kg and the lowest temperature of -8.6 °C were achieved when the hot water temperature was maintained at 94 °C. The maximum refrigeration cycle coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.139 was obtained under the condition of heating the water to reach 94 °C then cooling naturally the hot water without maintaining heating. The system heat utilization efficiency decreased with the increase of heat source temperature due to the greater heat loss in desorption process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Adsorpt,"The objective of this work is to develop CuCl@AC adsorbent with high CO capacity and selectivity from CO/N2binary gas mixture. A series of CuCl@AC adsorbents were prepared by a solid-state auto dispersion method, and then characterized by N2adsorption test, XRD and XPS. CO and N2adsorption isotherms on the adsorbents were measured by a volumetric method. The adsorption isotherms and selectivities of CuCl@AC adsorbents for CO/N2binary mixture were estimated on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). Results showed that (a) CO uptakes of CuCl@AC increased with CuCl loading in the loading range of 0–1.2 g/g. The maximal CO adsorption capacity of the CuCl@AC with CuCl loading of 1.2 g/g reached 38 cc/g at the P/P0of 0.40, around 8 times of that over the original AC; (b) calcination time for the preparation of Cu(I)@AC had significantly impact on CO adsorption of the adsorbents due to valence change of Cu species on carbon surfaces. XPS analysis indicated that when the calcination time was optimized to be 1 h at 350 °C under argon, the prepared Cu(I)@AC had the highest percentage of Cu+species on its surfaces, and consequently it had the highest CO capacity among the adsorbents since adsorptive species responsible for CO adsorption is Cu+; (c) The IAST-predicted CO/N2adsorption selectivities of 1.2CuCl/AC decreased with pressure. Its CO/N2selectivity was up to 100–450 at low pressure range of 0–10 kPa, and it remained in the range of 50–100 at higher pressure range of 20–100 kPa. The high adsorption capacity and selectivity of Cu(I)@AC adsorbents made it a promising adsorbent for CO/N2mixture separation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20152400928417,,"Huang, Yan (1); Tao, Ying (2); He, Liang (2); Duan, Yu (3); Xiao, Jing (3); Li, Zhong (1) ","(1) School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou; 510640, China (2) Research & Development Center, China Tobacco Yunnan Industrial, Co., LTD, Kunming; 650231, China (3) Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of the Ministry of Education, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou; 510640, China ",ADSOFO,802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Adsorbents - Adsorption isotherms - Binary mixtures - Calcination - Catalyst selectivity - Chlorine compounds - Gas adsorption - Gas mixtures - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Zhong(cezhli@scut.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s10450-015-9677-5,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15728757,,,,09295607,5,"July 23, 2015",English,Copper compounds,,42.0,373-381,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Adsorption,,Preparation of CuCl@AC with high CO adsorption capacity and selectivity from CO/N2binary mixture,,Adsorption selectivity - Binary gas mixture - CO adsorption - Dispersion methods - High adsorption capacity - Ideal adsorbed solution theories (IAST) - Mixture separation - Volumetric methods,21,
Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"Robust object tracking has been a challenging issue due to pose variation, illumination change, abrupt motion, background clutter, and etc.. Compressive sensing theory provided a new and effective way for real-time object tracking. In this paper, a compressive tracking method based on Particle Filter (PFCT) was proposed. The candidate objects were predicted based on Particle Filter. The sparse random Gaussian matrix was as the measurement matrix. The element number of a measurement vector was set as a special value, which was different for each video sequence.

Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao,"The friction effect between mortise-tenon joints interface of the timber structures has a significant effect on damping energy dissipation. In order to study the influence of friction coefficient on seismic performance of typical mortise-tenon joints, three typical joints with different friction coefficients were tested by low-cycle reversed loading, including two through tenons, two dovetail tenons and two fang under through tenons, and were analyzed by means of quantitative research method. The results indicate that the failure patterns, bearing capacity and ductility of the joints are not significantly influenced by the friction. The shapes of hysteretic loops of all joints except dovetail tenons are reverse Z shape and the pinching effect gets obvious. The area of hysteretic loops of model with friction coefficient of 0.2 is much smaller than that of the model with friction coefficient of 0.38. Hysteretic loops of the dovetail tenons are relatively full and the pinching effect is not obvious. The change of friction coefficient has smaller influence on area of hysteretic loops of the dovetail tenons. The influence of friction on the initial stiffness of through tenons and fang under through tenons is great. The equivalent viscous damping coefficient of through tenon joints model with friction coefficient of 0.38 is twice as big as that of the model with friction coefficient of 0.20. For fang under through tenons joints, the model with friction coefficient of 0.38 is 1.4 times as much as the model with friction coefficient of 0.20. The impact of the friction of the dovetail joint is mainly reflected by the speed to achieve the peak energy dissipation of the joints. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"In the present paper, the stoichiometric ratio (R) for the interreaction of DPPH radicals with the antoxidant was employed as a evaluation index for DPPH radicals scavenging activity of antioxidants. This evaluation index was related only with the stoichiometric relationship between DPPH radicals and the antioxidant, not the relationship with the initial DPPH amount and the volume of sample, which could offer a solution for the problem of poor comparability of EC50under different conditions. A novel photometric micro-titration method was proposed for the determination of the stoichiometric ratio (R) for the interreaction of DPPH radicals with the antoxidant. The titration equation was established based on the absorbance difference (ΔA) of DPPH radicals in the titration process and the added amount of antoxidant. The stoichiometric ratio (R) for the reaction of DPPH radicals with the addition amount of antoxidant was determined by the titration equation obtained, while, the DPPH median elimination concentration (EC50) of antoxidant can be calculated by the stoichiometric ratio (R). The above photometric micro-titration model was verified using rutin as DPPH radicals scavenger. As experiment results, the stoichiometric ratio (R) of DPPH radicals to rutin was determined to be in the range of 1.817~1.846. The calculated value of EC50was 1.196×10-3, 2.392×10-3, 4.819×10-3and 7.292×10-3mg·mL-1for 1.12×10-7, 2.24×10-7, 4.48×10-7and 6.72×10-7mol of the addition amount of DPPH radicals, respectively. The proposed method has better precision and reliability with smaller amount of sample than conventional method. While, the obtained stoichiometric ratio value (R) of rutin was employed to calculate the rutin median elimination concentration for DPPH (EC50) according to the conditions as reported in the literatures, and the calculated results were consistent with that reported in the literatures. ©, 2014, Science Press.

Authors investigated the bulk strength of the specimens at different levels of methane hydrate saturation, using a self-developed integrated gas hydrate formation and triaxial compression apparatus. The results show that the stress-strain curves exhibit strain softening under confining pressure 1 and 2 MPa while exhibiting strain hardening under 3 MPa. The results also show that confining pressure has significant impact on the failure strength. The failure strength linearly increases with the increase of saturation, with little fluctuation. The friction angle and cohesion are weakly dependent on saturation.

Xiyou Jinshu,"The thermodynamic calculations were performed for malachite leaching in the cyanide solution, and the potential-pH (E-pH) diagrams of CuCO3Cu(OH)2-H2O, CuCO3Cu(OH)2-CN-H2O, CuCO3Cu(OH)2-Au-CN-H2O were obtained at temperature of 298.15 K and pressure of 0.1 MPa. Based on the stable region and the area changes of each material in the E-pH diagrams, the affecting factors of malachite leaching in cyanide solution were analyzed. The results showed that malachite was insoluble in the absence of complex ions in alkaline solution. And the stable region of copper cyanide complexes appeared and the stable region of solid malachite shrank with 1×10-2mol·L-1CN-being added to an alkaline CuCO3Cu(OH)2-H2O system. With cyanide concentration increased from 1×10-2to 0.1 mol·L-1, the stable region of Cu(CN)2-disappeared, the stable region of Cu(CN)32-shrank and the stable region of Cu(CN)43-appeared. It was found that in an alkaline oxygen-free environment gold could be leached under the combined effect of malachite and cyanide. In addition, the by-products (CN)2which was produced by the reaction between malachite and cyanide in alkaline environment could be decomposed into CN-and CNO-, and the oxidation reaction of CN-would occur with the presence of oxygen. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

"Proc. Chin. Control Decis. Conf., CCDC","To accurately detect and position small cycle slip is critical for high-precision BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) data processing. Thus, a method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) was proposed in this paper for detecting single-frequency small cycle-slip. First of all, detectable quantity of cycle-slip was measured according to observations of pseudo-range and carrier-phase. Then, a track matrix of attractors was constructed with Hankel matrix and processed with SVD to determine the singular value that reflected abrupt information. At last, signal components were reconstructed by inverse operations and transformation of reflexive space through SVD to detect cycle-slip pursuant to the position of signals in case of the maximum value. The experimental results suggested that the method put forward in this paper was effective for precisely detecting small cycle-slip within one to five cycles based on observations of single-frequency carrier-phase. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20154401482764,7162553,"Gao, Yang (1, 2); Huang, Guoyong (1, 2); Zhang, Xiaohe (1, 2); Xu, Hongwu (1, 2); Zhang, Liping (1, 2) ","(1) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (2) Engineering Research Center for Mineral Pipeline Transportation of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China ",,,115665.0,"May 23, 2015 - May 25, 2015","Qingdao, China","27th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2015",,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Guoyong ",10.1109/CCDC.2015.7162553,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479970179.0,,,"July 17, 2015",English,,"Proceedings of the 2015 27th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2015",14.0,3627-3631,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of the 2015 27th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2015",,Small cycle-slip detection of single-frequency in BDS based on SVD,,,,

These grinding wheels exhibited no cracks or pores. Moreover, the related properties of these products were characterized by the measurements of compression resistance, Brinell hardness, and wear resistance; the results were comparable to those of commercial grinding wheels prepared with synthetic phenolic resins and aluminum oxide particles. The results indicated that incomparable hardness and strong resistance towards compression can be obtained using the new tannin-based grinding wheels.

J Am Ceram Soc,"Rare-earth ion-doped semiconducting phosphor has attracted extensive attention due to the ability to achieve efficient luminescence through the host sensitization. Here, we present a new type red-emitting Eu3+-doped BiOCl phosphors possessing a broad excitation band in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) region. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations confirm that Eu3+ion dopants result in forming impurity energy level near valence band, and the excellent broadband NUV-exciting ability of Eu3+ion is due to the electronic transitions of BiOCl band gap. Moreover, the highest emission intensity of the phosphors is from the5D0→7F4transition of Eu3+around 699 nm (far-red) through whether host excitation or direct Eu3+ions excitation, which lie in the particular structure of BiOCl crystals.

Immune algorithm is embedded in ANSYS by ANSYS Parameter Design Language (APDL). The mathematical optimization and the electromagnetic calculation are completed simultaneously. In the process of optimal design, the special structure and complex magnetic circuit of SCR are considered fully. The accuracy of electromagnetic calculation is ensured by the ANSYS finite element field-circuit coupling method. And the efficiency of optimal calculation is improved by immune algorithm, which has excellent converging speed and searching ability. The new proposed method and the conventional method are compared in calculation efficiency and precision though two examples.

Energy Build.,"Photovoltaic power forecasting (PVPF) can help energy management system and power grid to improve the proportion of solar energy in total energy consumption. Classification modeling according to different weather types is an effective means to improve the accuracy of PVPF under various weather statuses. However, the weather type of historical data (WTHD) is missing in some cases, which will cause great difficulties to classification modeling because the data without WTHD cannot be used for the model training. To identify the missing WTHD, a solar irradiance feature extraction and support vector machines (SVM) based weather statuses pattern recognition (WSPR) model for short-term PVPF (ST-PVPF) is presented. To ensure the feasibility and reduce the workload of classification modeling, four generalized weather classes (GWC) covering all weather types are constituted, and GWC based classification modeling approach for ST-PVPF is proposed subsequently. The SVM model for WSPR is built with input features extracted from solar irradiance data. Through a case study, the effectiveness and performance of the WSPR model are verified and evaluated. The influences of different input dimensions and feature combinations are also analyzed and discussed. The results indicate that the missing WTHD can be effectively recovered as GWC by the proposed model. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Acta Tabacaria Sin.,"The objective of this study is to determine suitable fitting models of tobacco leaf curves, so as to provide a reliable way for the quantitative description of tobacco plant types. Accurate geometrical shape of tobacco leaves was obtained through 3D laser scanning technology based on geometrical data. 3D coordinates of leaf midrib curves of different varieties at different growth stages were extracted. The 3D coordinates of leaf curves were transformed to 2D plane and were fitted with general quadratic equation, elliptic equation, parabolic equation and the combination equation. Results showed that for leaf curves without hook-like tips, the parabolic equation could fit well, boasting simplicity and high stability. While for leaf curves with hook-like tips, a combination model of parabolic and elliptic equation was a good choice.

J Wuhan Univ Technol Mater Sci Ed,"One-dimensional, diluted magnetic semiconductor nanofibers have attracted increasing attention for their unique magnetic properties, large specific surface area, and high porosity. These qualities lead to excellent performance in magneto-optical devices, magnetic resonance imaging, ferrofluids and magnetic separation. The purpose of this study is to fabricate P-type one dimensional CuAlO2-based diluted magnetic semiconductor nanofibers. First, we fabricated CuAl0.95Co0.05O2nanofibers with an average diameter of 1 μm with the electrospinning method. The annealed nanofibers were thermally treated at a temperature of 1 100 °C and then shrunk to a diameter of about 650 nm. We used X-ray diffraction measurements and Raman spectra to confirm that the CuAl0.95Co0.05O2nanofibers had a single impurity free delafossite phase. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates that Co was present in the +2 oxidation state, resulting in an room temperature ferromagnetism in the CuAl0.95Co0.05O2fiber. This contrasts with nonmagnetism in pristine CuAlO2fiber. The coercivity (Hc) value of 65.26 Oe and approximate saturation magnetization (Ms) of 0.012 emu/g demonstrate good evidence of ferromagnetism at room temperature for CuAl0.95Co0.05O2nanofibers. © 2015, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20150600501991,,"Wang, Yu (1); Dong, Chengjun (2); Chuai, Yahui (1); Wang, Yiding (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Integrated Optoelectronics, Jilin University, Changchun; 130012, China (2) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650031, China ",JWUTE8,701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.4 Magnetic Materials - 712.1.2 Compound Semiconducting Materials - 761 Nanotechnology - 819.3 Fiber Chemistry and Processing - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Aluminum compounds - Cobalt compounds - Copper compounds - Diluted magnetic semiconductors - Electrospinning - Fabrication - Ferromagnetism - Magnetic fluids - Magnetic resonance imaging - Magnetic semiconductors - Magnetic separation - Nanofibers - Saturation magnetization - X ray diffraction - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yiding(wangyu_89911@126.com) ",10.1007/s11595-015-1089-6,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),19930437,,,,10002413,1,2015,English,Semiconducting aluminum compounds,,16.0,,,2015,Wuhan Ligong Daxue,"Journal Wuhan University of Technology, Materials Science Edition",,Room temperature ferromagnetism in Co-doped CuAlO2nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning,,Average diameter - Co-doped - Electrospinning method - High porosity - Large specific surface areas - Oxidation state - Room temperature ferromagnetism - X-ray diffraction measurements,30,

Metall Mat Trans A Phys Metall Mat Sci,"Solar grade silicon (SOG-Si) and hypereutectic Al-Si alloys with low silicon (silicon composition below 25 pct) can be successfully obtained by separation of hypereutectic Al-Si alloy with high silicon (silicon composition above 30 pct) under an alternating electromagnetic field after post-processing. To explore the separation mechanism in detail, experiments were conducted in this study using a high-frequency induction furnace with different pulling conditions of the crucible which is loaded with Al-45 wt pct Si melt. Results demonstrate that the separation of hypereutectic Al-Si alloy is feasible through either a pull-up or drop-down process. The height of each separation interface between the compact and sparse parts of the primary silicon decrease as the pull-up distance rose. When the pulling rate is very low, resultant morphologies of compact primary silicon are rounded and polygonal, allowing for more effective separation of the primary silicon. A novel physical model is presented here based on the experimental results and simulation. The model can be used to effectively describe the separation mechanism of primary silicon from hypereutectic Al-Si melts under alternating electromagnetic fields. © 2015, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,,20151700781104,2889,"Xue, Haiyang (1, 2, 3); Lv, Guoqiang (1, 2, 3); Ma, Wenhui (1, 2, 3); Chen, Daotong (2, 3); Yu, Jie (1, 2, 3) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Cleaning Utilization in Yunnan Province/The National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Non-Ferrous Metals Vacuum Metallurgy of Yunnan Province/Engineering Research Center for Silicon Metallurgy and Silicon Materials of Yunnan Provincial Universities, Kunming; 650093, China ",MMTAEB,541.2 Aluminum Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 701 Electricity and Magnetism,,,,,Aluminum alloys - Electromagnetic fields,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lv, Guoqiang(lvguoqiang_ok@aliyun.com) ",10.1007/s11661-015-2889-1,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10735623,7,"July 26, 2015",English,Silicon alloys,,22.0,2922-2932,,2015,Springer Boston,Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A: Physical Metallurgy and Materials Science,,Separation Mechanism of Primary Silicon from Hypereutectic Al-Si Melts Under Alternating Electromagnetic Fields,,Alternating electromagnetic field - High frequency induction - Hypereutectic Al-Si - Hypereutectic Al-Si alloys - Primary silicon - Separation interface - Separation mechanism - Solar grade silicons,46,
Food. Funct.,"Disorders of blood lipid metabolism are the primary risk factors for many diseases. Recently, the effect of Pu-erh tea on blood lipid metabolism has received increasing attention. However, the mechanism underlying its ability to regulate blood lipid metabolism is unclear. We set out to study this through assessing the effects of Pu-erh tea aqueous extract (PTAE) on the central enzymes of blood lipid metabolism, including lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2(Lp-PLA2), lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and pancreatic lipase (PL). We find that the Lp-PLA2, HMRG and PL activities are inhibited by PTAE in a dose-dependent manner and that the LCAT activity tends to increase with increasing PTAE concentrations. Lineweaver-Burk plot analyses reveal that PTAE acts as a competitive inhibitor for HMGR and PL and as a noncompetitive inhibitor for Lp-PLA2. Moreover, we determine that its active ingredients include catechins, gallic acid, caffeine, free amino acids, and soluble sugar. However, the effect of each ingredient and whether any of them have synergistic effects are still unknown. The results suggest that Pu-erh tea has a potent ability to regulate blood lipid metabolism and knowledge of the mechanisms provides insights into its potential therapeutic application as an alternative hypolipidemic drug. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,20152500957775,,"Zeng, Liang (1, 3); Yan, Jingna (1); Luo, Liyong (1); Zhang, Dongying (2, 3) ","(1) College of Food Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, China (2) College of Longrun Pu-erh Tea, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China (3) TAETEA Group Postdoctoral Research Station, Menghai, China ",,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Blood - Enzymes - Lipids - Plants (botany),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Dongying(zhangdongying365@163.com) ",10.1039/c5fo00362h,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),2042650X,,,,20426496,6,"June 1, 2015",English,Metabolism,,69.0,2008-2016,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,Food and Function,,Effects of Pu-erh tea aqueous extract (PTAE) on blood lipid metabolism enzymes,,3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase - Active ingredients - Dose-dependent manner - Hypolipidemic drugs - Lineweaver-Burk plots - Pancreatic lipase - Synergistic effect - Therapeutic Application,6,
Opt. Lett.,"We propose a graphene-based plasmonic heterostructure in which a new class of plasmon polariton modes can be realized via fundamental coupling of conventional graphene plasmons (GPS) and spoof surface plasmons or radiation modes. We name these electromagnetic modes coupled graphene plasmon polaritons (CGPPs). It is found that the properties of the CGPPs can be tuned by the geometry of the heterostructure, the material used to fill the holes, and the electron density in graphene. Most interestingly, we show that it is possible to achieve CGPPs with about 10 times enhancement of wave localization or about 300 times enhancement of propagation length, compared to usual GPS through varying device parameters.

Energy Convers. Manage.,"Eutectic molten salt can be used as the latent thermal energy storage medium in solar energy applications. Nitrates and their binary mixtures are suitable phase change material (PCM) for solar energy applications in middle-temperature-range of 200-300 °C. In the present study, binary nitrate (50 wt.% NaNO3, 50 wt.% KNO3) with a melting temperature of about 220 °C was employed as the PCM, and expanded graphite (EG) with the mass fraction of 5%, 10% or 20% was used to enhance the thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivities of pure nitrates and nitrate/EG shape-stabilized composites were measured with a steady-state test rig firstly. Results showed that the addition of EG significantly enhanced the thermal conductivities, e.g., the thermal conductivities of sodium nitrate/20 wt.% EG composite PCM were measured to be 6.66-7.70 W/(m K) in the temperature range of 20-120 °C, indicating about seven times larger than those of pure sodium nitrate. Furthermore, pure binary nitrate and nitrate/EG composite PCM were encapsulated in a cylindrical storage unit with a diameter of 70.0 mm and a length of 280.0 mm. Heat storage and retrieval tests were conducted extensively at different heating temperatures of 250 °C, 260 °C and 270 °C, and different cooling temperatures of 30 °C, 70 °C and 110 °C. Time-durations from temperature evolutions showed that both the melting and solidification processes were accelerated by EG, and the heat transfer characteristics were interpreted by the numerical analysis based on enthalpy-porosity and volume-of-fluid models. The evolution of nitrate/air interface caused by volume expansion ascended gradually during melting, while that caused by volume shrinkage descended during freezing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"A rapid and sensitive electrochemical sensor based on disulfides bridged β-cyclodextrin dimer-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (DBβ-CD-MWCNT) nanohybrids with higher supramolecular recognition capability was successfully constructed for the first time. Simultaneous trace analysis of three phenols (4-aminophenol, 4-AP; 4-chlorophenol, 4-CP; 4-nitrophenol, 4-NP) in tap-water and wastewater samples was performed based on the constructed sensor. Cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were utilized to characterize the properties of the modified electrode. The proposed DBβ-CD-MWCNT-modified electrode displayed electrochemical signal superior to those of β-CD-MWCNT and MWCNT towards 4-AP, 4-CP, and 4-NP. Under optimal conditions, differential pulse voltammetry was used to simultaneously quantify 4-AP, 4-CP, and 4-NP within the concentration range of 0.01-20, 0.1-200, and 0.1-200. μM, respectively. The detection limits (S/. N=3) of the DBβ-CD-MWCNT nanohybrid electrode for 4-AP, 4-CP, and 4-NP were 0.0042, 0.028, and 0.048. μM, respectively. Satisfactory results revealed that this proposed electrochemical sensor can provide a promising candidate for the simultaneous trace analysis of 4-AP, 4-CP, and 4-NP in environmental monitoring of water and wastewater samples.

Environ. Earth Sci.,"Phosphorus adsorption and release characteristics of surface sediments from Dianchi Lake were investigated through indoor simulation experiments. Kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption and release of phosphorus in sediments were studied, and the influence of different phosphorus fractions on adsorption and release was analysed. Results show that the total phosphorus content in the sediments ranged from 843.96 to 8144.44 mg kg−1, which was 2–8 times as much as those in other lakes in China (e.g. Erhai Lake and Taihu Lake). The average values of different phosphorus forms in the sediment samples were ranked in the order of organic P (OP), calcium-bound P (Ca-P), metal oxide-bound P (Al-P), residual P (Res-P), Fe-bound P (Fe-P) and weakly absorbed P(NH4Cl-P). Compared with the case of other lakes in China, the sedimentary phosphorus adsorption capacity of Dianchi Lake was at a higher level, but its maximal release rate and release capacity were low, indicating a relatively low release risk. By comparing the equilibrium phosphate concentration in the sediments and the soluble reactive phosphorus in the overlying water, the risks of phosphorus release from sediments in Caohai, Lake Central and Southern Waihai were found to be relatively low in the short term, but were high in Northern Waihai. The release behaviour of sedimentary phosphorus in Dianchi Lake was mainly determined by NH4Cl-P, Fe-P and Al-P, among which NH4Cl-P and Fe-P served a greater function. Therefore, the contents of different fractions of phosphorus and their distribution characterization should be considered when characterizing the adsorption and release status of lake sedimentary phosphorus. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20153201157638,,"Chen, Chunyu (1); Deng, Weiming (1); Xu, Xiaomei (1); He, Jia (1, 2); Wang, Shengrui (3); Jiao, Lixin (3); Zhang, Ying (1) ","(1) Kunming Institute of Environmental Science, Kunming; Yunnan; 650032, China (2) College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing; 100875, China (3) Chinese Research Academy of Environment Sciences, Beijing; 100012, China ",,481.1 Geology - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 802.3 Chemical Operations,,,,,Adsorption - Aluminum compounds - Chlorine compounds - Iron compounds - Lakes - Metals - Sedimentology - Surficial sediments - Thermodynamics,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","He, Jia(dcszxb@163.com) ",10.1007/s12665-015-4723-x,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18666299,,,,18666280,5,"October 1, 2015",English,Nitrogen compounds,,39.0,3689-3700,,2015,Springer Verlag,Environmental Earth Sciences,,"Phosphorus adsorption and release characteristics of surface sediments in Dianchi Lake, China",,Dianchi lakes - Kinetics and thermodynamics - Phosphate concentration - Phosphorus adsorption - Phosphorus release - Release characteristics - Soluble reactive phosphorus - Surface sediments,74,

AIP Conf. Proc.,"According to Hamilton's principle, a new mathematical model and analytical solutions for nonlocal Timoshenko beam model (ANT) is established based on nonlocal elastic continuum theory when shear deformation and nonlocal effect are considered. The new ANT equilibrium equations and boundary conditions are derived for bending analysis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with simply supported, clamped and cantilever. The ANT deflection solutions demonstrate that the CNT stiffness is enhanced by the presence of nonlocal stress effects. Furthermore, the new ANT model concluded verifiable bending behaviors for a cantilever CNT with point load at the free end, which depends on the strength of nonlocal stress. Therefore, this new model will gives a better prediction for mechanical behaviors of nanostructures. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,,20151200662715,460003,"Zhang, Jianming (1); Yang, Yang (1) ","(1) Department of Engineering Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,,111492.0,"September 22, 2014 - September 28, 2014","Rhodes, Greece","International Conference on Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics 2014, ICNAAM 2014",,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1063/1.4912677,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),15517616,,,9780735412873.0,0094243X,,"March 10, 2015",English,,,8.0,,1 of 1,2015,American Institute of Physics Inc.,AIP Conference Proceedings,Santilli Foundation,Shear deformable deformation of carbon nanotubes based on a new analytical nonlocal Timoshenko beam nodel,,,1648,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics 2014, ICNAAM 2014"
,"This paper proposes a double fiber taper-based mode converter that converts LP01to LP02and vice versa. The first taper is used to convert LP01to some higher order LP0m(m > 1) modes while the second taper suppresses the undesired higher order modes (m > 2) and results in LP02overwhelmingly dominated. A simulation shows that conversion efficiency of almost 100% at the central wavelength of O-, S-, and C-Band, and above 98% over the S- and C-Band was achieved. Moreover, suppression of undesired higher order modes is more than 10 dB over the whole O-, S-, and C-Band. In particular, the suppression is more than 19 dB for the whole C-Band. The analysis also shows that the performance of the mode converter is not sensitive to slight variations of the converter's parameters. The same converter also can be used to convert LP02back to LP01. It is shown that conversion efficiency higher than 99% and suppression of undesired higher order modes higher than 30 dB can be obtained. Further, a (de)multiplexer for an LP02and an LP01mode was designed using the mode converter combined with a symmetric directional coupler. The multiplexer is broadband and has an insertion loss less than 0.5 dB in the C-Band. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,,20153801292421,,"Mellah, Hakim (1); Zhang, Xiupu (1, 2); Shen, Dongya (2) ","(1) IPhotonics Laboratories, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal; QC; H3G 1M8, Canada (2) ICom Laboratories, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",APOPAI,525.5 Energy Conversion Issues - 741.1.2 Fiber Optics - 913.1 Production Engineering,,,,,Conversion efficiency - Multiplexing equipment - Optical fibers,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Xiupu(xzhang@ece.concordia.ca) ",10.1364/AO.54.005568,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),21553165,,,,1559128X,17,"June 10, 2015",English,Efficiency,,35.0,5568-5575,,2015,OSA - The Optical Society,,,"Analysis of optical fiber-based LP01 LP02mode converters for the O-, S-, and C-Band",,C-bands - Central wavelength - Fiber taper - Higher-order - Higher-order modes - Mode converter,54,
Mater. Corros.,"The corrosion inhibition behavior of methyl violet in the absence and presence of bromide ion on mild steel in sulfuric acid solution has been studied by weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that the corrosion of mild steel is obviously reduced by methyl violet in combination with bromide ion. Electrochemical studies show that methyl violet and bromide ion act as mixed type inhibitors retarding the cathodic and anodic corrosion reactions with emphasis on the former and do not change the mechanism of either hydrogen evolution reaction or mild steel dissolution. The corrosion reaction is controlled by charge-transfer process. The adsorption of the inhibitors on the mild steel surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The calculated thermodynamic and kinetic parameters (ΔGoads, ΔHoads, ΔSoads, Kads, and Ea) reveal a strong interaction between inhibitors and mild steel surface. The values of ΔGoadsshow that the inhibitors are adsorbed on the mild steel surface in sulfuric acid by chemical adsorption mechanism. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Anal. Chem.,"Porous organic molecular cages as a new type of porous materials have attracted a tremendous attention for their potential applications in recent years. Here we report the use of a homochiral porous organic cage (POC) (CC3-R) diluted with a polysiloxane (OV-1701) as a stationary phase for high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) with excellent enantioselectivity. A large number of optical isomers have been resolved without derivatization, including chiral alcohols, diols, amines, alcohol amines, esters, ketones, ethers, halohydrocarbons, organic acids, amino acid methyl esters, and sulfoxides. Compared with commercial β-DEX 120 and Chirasil-L-Val columns, the CC3-R coated capillary column offered more preeminent enantioselectivity. In addition, CC3-R also exhibits good selectivity for the separation of isomers, linear alkanes, alcohols, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The excellent resolution ability, repeatability, and thermal stability make CC3-R a promising candidate as a novel stationary phase for GC. The study described herein first proves useful commercially. This work also indicates that porous organic molecular materials will become more attractive in separation science.

This event-driven scheme is triggered by the updated covariance which is commonly used to describe errors between the true value and the estimated one. In this scheme, each sensor node communicates with its neighbour nodes when the updated covariance exceeds a given threshold for ensuring the filtering accuracy, otherwise not communicates for saving energy. Moreover, this scheme has self-adaptive function to adjust times of connection among nodes according to different given filtering accuracies.

Metall. Min. Ind.,"Dynamic triaxial test at room temperature is performed and the influence of the joint action of freeze-thaw cycle and train load is analyzed. This article studied the influence of the number of freeze-thaw cycles, the melting temperature and amplitude of dynamic stress on the resilient deformation and accumulated permanent deformation of the silty clay along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. According to the analysis results, (1) As the number of freeze-thaw cycles increases, the accumulative plastic strain of the silty clay on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway grows with the increase of the number of vibration. Meanwhile, its failure mode slowly evolves from brittle failure to plastic failure; (2) Resilient strain shows a growing trend with the increase of the number of freeze-thaw cycles and the corresponding resilient modulus is declining, but the effect of freeze-thaw cycles is larger than that of the last two factors, both showing only mild changes; (3) As the temperature during thawing rises, the accumulative plastic strain increases, which causes the rise of resilient strain and the drop of the corresponding resilient modulus; the larger the dynamic strain amplitude, the greater the influence of temperature during thawing on accumulative plastic strain is. © 2015.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"The genuineness and producing area of Panax notoginseng were studied based on infrared spectroscopy combined with discriminant analysis. The infrared spectra of 136 taproots of P. notoginseng from 13 planting point in 11 counties were collected and the second derivate spectra were calculated by Omnic 8.0 software. The infrared spectra and their second derivate spectra in the range 1 800~700 cm-1were used to build model by stepwise discriminant analysis, which was in order to distinguish study on the genuineness of P. notoginseng. The model built based on the second derivate spectra showed the better recognition effect for the genuineness of P. notoginseng. The correct rate of returned classification reached to 100%, and the prediction accuracy was 93.4%. The stability of model was tested by cross validation and the method was performed extrapolation validation. The second derivate spectra combined with the same discriminant analysis method were used to distinguish the producing area of P. notoginseng. The recognition effect of models built based on different range of spectrum and different numbers of samples were compared and found that when the model was built by collecting 8 samples from each planting point as training sample and the spectrum in the range 1 500~1 200 cm-1, the recognition effect was better, with the correct rate of returned classification reached to 99.0%, and the prediction accuracy was 76.5%. The results indicated that infrared spectroscopy combined with discriminant analysis showed good recognition effect for the genuineness of P. notoginseng. The method might be a hopeful new method for identification of genuineness of P. notoginseng in practice.

Shengxue Xuebao,"The ultrasound simulation for carotid arteries is helpful to the performance assessment of vessel wall detection and signal processing method by using ultrasound techniques.

Huagong Xuebao,"A novel CuCl@β zeolite with high CO capacity and high-selectivity for CO/N2and CO/CO2mixtures was developed. A series of CuCl@β zeolites were prepared by an auto single-layer dispersion method. The CuCl@β zeolites were characterized by N2adsorption and XRD. The adsorption isotherms and dynamic breakthrough curves of CO on the adsorbents were measured separately by a static adsorption and fixed-bed experiments. The adsorption selectivities of CuCl@β zeolite for CO/N2and CO/CO2mixtures were estimated on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). The results showed that (a) the loading of CuCl onto β zeolite significantly enhanced CO adsorption capacity of the resulting CuCl@β adsorbent and the CuCl loading was optimized to be 0.4. (b) it not only significantly enhanced CO uptake, but also weakened N2and CO2adsorption on the CuCl@β adsorbents. As a result, it significantly enhanced CO/N2and CO/CO2selectivities of the adsorbent further, which can be attributed to the mild Cu+-CO interaction by π-complexation bond.

The proposed method makes full use of the multi-core processors and the large memory of modern computers. Multivariant searchers (atoms) explore the solution space and remember the historical information selectively. The MOA gets its name from the multivariant characters of multiple searchers. Atoms are divided into global atoms and local atoms according to variant responsibilities. Global atoms explore the whole solution space to discover potential areas. Local atoms exploit potential areas for a local refinement. Theoretically, the MOA is proved to be accessible to the global optimal solution.

Lect. Notes Electr. Eng.,"In order to improve the throughput of tags identification in the system of radio frequency identification (RFID), the anticollision protocol of adaptive tree slot is proposed, and that is a tag anticollision algorithm in view of the Q algorithm. In this protocol, the rest of the tags will be waiting until those that are in the first collision slot are decomposed with the method of the binary tree. Besides, the tags in the rest of the collision slots will be resolved by the tree slot. The advantage of the proposed protocol lies in the fact that it does not need the prior information about tags, which can reduce the complexity of the system; furthermore, the system with high identification efficiency can be kept, and the change of the tag quantity cannot influence it. It indicates in our simulations that the identification efficiency of the system does not fluctuate much when the number of tags is between 40 and 500; moreover, when the tag quantity does not approach to the original frame length, the identification efficiency of the system is higher than the tree slotted ALOHA (TSA) algorithm and fast k-slot selection (FKSS) protocol. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,20153201154009,,"Zhu, Qin (1); Wu, Haifeng (1) ","(1) School of Electrical and Information Technology, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming; 650500, China ",,"716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 913.1 Production Engineering - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Binary trees - Collision avoidance - Efficiency - Trees (mathematics),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhu, Qin(whf5469@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-13707-0_126,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18761119,,,,18761100,,2015,English,Radio frequency identification (RFID),,10.0,1137-1142,,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,,An anticollision protocol of adaptive tree slot without tag estimation,,Adaptive tree - Anti collision - Anti-collision protocols - Frame length - Prior information - Slotted Aloha - Tag anti-collision algorithms - Tag estimation,334,

Zhongguo Jiguang,"Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (G-APD) arrays is being concerned in ultra-weak-light detection. It is necessary to analyze performance of satellite laser ranging system based on G-APDs before engineering application. In this paper, the way of numerical calculation and simulation is used. In the condition of laser echo in the magnitude of single photon and only considering the dark counting noise, although the detect probability and the degree of identifying detection data are low, the effective detection points are enhanced relative to using a single photon detector. As laser echo in multiphoton and only considering the dark counting noise,the use of G-APDs is able to reduce the output of the detector drift. The laser echo is flooded when the detector working in geiger mode because of the strong noise which contains the dark counting noise and day light noise.

J. Colloid Interface Sci.,"A series of one-dimensional polyaniline-crystalline TiO2-halloysite composite nanotubes with different mass ratio of polyaniline to TiO2are facilely prepared by employing the low-temperature synthesis of crystalline TiO2on halloysite nanotubes. The halloysite nanotubes can adsorb TiO2/polyaniline precursors and induce TiO2nanocrystals/polyaniline to grow on the support in situ simultaneously. By simply adjusting the acidity of reaction system, PANI-crystalline TiO2-HA composite nanotubes composed of anatase, a mixed phase TiO2and different PANI redox state are obtained. The XRD and UV-vis results show that the surface polyaniline sensitization has no effect on the crystalline structure of halloysite and TiO2and the light response of TiO2is extended to visible-light regions. Photocatalysis test results reveal the photocatalytic activity will be affected by the pH value and the volume ratio of ANI to TTIP. The highest photocatalytic activity is achieved with the composite photocatalysts prepared at pH 0.5 and 1% volume ratio of ANI and TTIP owing to the sensitizing effect of polyaniline and the charge transfer from the photoexcited PANI sensitizer to TiO2. Moreover, the PANI-TiO2-HA composite nanotubes synthesized by one-step at pH 0.5 with 1% volume ratio of ANI to TTIP exhibit higher visible light photocatalytic activity than those synthesized by the two-step. Heterogeneous PANI-TiO2-HA composite nanotubes prepared at pH 0.5 exhibit a higher degradation activity than that prepared at pH 1.5. The redoped experiment proves that the PANI redox state plays the main contribution to the enhanced visible light catalytic degradation efficiency of PANI-TiO2-HA prepared at pH 0.5. Furthermore, the heterogeneous PANI-crystalline TiO2-HA nanotubes have good photocatalytic stability and can be reused four times with only gradual loss of activity under visible light irradiation. © 2015.",,,20152901045859,,"Li, Cuiping (1); Wang, Jie (1); Guo, Hong (1); Ding, Shujiang (2) ","(1) Department of Applied Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource, Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) MOE Key Laboratory for Nonequilibrium Synthesis and Modulation of Condensed Matter, Dept. of Applied Chemistry, School of Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an; 710049, China ",JCISA5,482.2 Minerals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 708.2 Conducting Materials - 741.1 Light/Optics - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 819.4 Fiber Products - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Charge transfer - Complexation - Crystalline materials - Degradation - Kaolinite - Light - Low temperature effects - Nanotubes - Photocatalysis - Photocatalysts - Polyaniline - Temperature - Yarn,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Cuiping(licp830@iccas.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.jcis.2015.07.025,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10957103,"Number: XT412003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2010Y240, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013Y361, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013FB002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 51003091, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2009B06Q, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51003091 ), the Applied Basic Foundation of Yunnan Province (No. 2013FB002 ), the Education Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (Nos. 2013Y361, 2010Y240 ), the Research Foundation of Yunnan University (No. 2009B06Q ) and Backbone Teacher Training Program of Yunnan University (No. XT412003 ).

In the end, the effect of six different types of load on voltage control is simulated, and the results show that: the change trend of voltage or reactive power is roughly the same when changing reactive power compensation; the change trend of the voltage is roughly the same, but the change trend of reactive power has great difference when changing transformer tap.",,,20161502228664,,"Liu, Jun-Wei (1); Xue, An-Cheng (1); Su, Shi (2); Li, Ping (2); Yan, Yu-Tin (2); Yang-Yang (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Source, North China Electric Power University, Beijing; 102206, China (2) Electricity Research Institute of Yunnan Power Grid Co., Ltd., Kunming, Yunnan Province; 650217, China ",,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 731.3 Specific Variables Control,119843.0,"October 17, 2015 - October 18, 2015","Beijing, China","International Conference on Renewable Power Generation, RPG 2015",Electric potential - Electric power utilization - Reactive power - Voltage control,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 51477050, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by the 973 Project (2012CB21520), in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51477050), in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015MS08).",,,CP679,2015,English,Power control,,10.0,,1of1,2015,Institution of Engineering and Technology,IET Conference Publications,,Analysis of nine zone diagram for voltage control of substation considering the load characteristics,,Change trends - Load characteristics - Load modeling - Nine zone diagram - Reactive power compensation - Reactive voltages - Transformer taps - Voltage and reactive power control,2015,
Phys Rev Lett,"The hydrogenation of monatomic silicene sheet on Ag(111) was studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. It was observed that hydrogenation of silicene at room temperature results in a perfectly ordered γ-(3×3) superstructure.

Moreover, by annealing to a moderate temperature, about 450 K, a dehydrogenation process occurs and the clean silicene surface can be fully recovered.

J. Comput. Inf. Syst.,"Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in collecting and understanding various sensor data. However, providing an intelligent service by exploiting the collected context data from heterogeneous sensors is difficult on smart home because it is a complex environment with various devices and appliances. In this paper, we propose a context-aware computing approach for heterogeneous smart home environments. The key idea in this work is to integrate large-scale home context information from multiple heterogeneous sensors. We first define a semantic decision by context-aware inference including rule, inference and pattern driven. Then, a designed architecture that manages home environment is developed between large numbers of heterogeneous information entities and enhances intelligence abilities. Using the established rules and inferences, the proposed method is applicable for intelligent home to further discover more useful representative activities and personalized services with inhabitant needs. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Water Air Soil Pollut.,"Abstract A CdS embedded metal-organic framework (MIL-100) composite was synthesized and used for photocatalytic degradation of nitrite ions. The obtained samples were characterized by a series of techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2adsorption/desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The results show that CdS nanoparticles were dispread and embedded on the MIL-100 crystals. The CdS/MIL-100 composites exhibited significant activities for photocatalytic degradation of nitrite ions through a disproportionation process in a neutral aqueous solution without any sacrificial reagents. When 20 wt% of CdS was embedded, the highest degradation yield of 92 % was achieved in 10-ppm NaNO2aqueous solution under simulated solar light irradiation, which was fivefold of bare CdS. The enhancement in photocatalytic activities could be contributed to photosensitization and supporting of metal-organic framework scaffold. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,,20152200888380,11270.0,"He, Jiao (1); Yang, Haiyan (1); Chen, Yongjuan (1); Yan, Zhiying (1); Zeng, Yanbo (1); Luo, Zhongrui (1); Gao, Wenyu (1); Wang, Jiaqiang (1) ","(1) Yunnan Engineering Research Center for Photocatalytic Treatment of Industrial Wastewater, School of Chemical Sciences and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",WAPLAC,405.1 Construction Equipment - 741.1 Light/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Cadmium sulfide - Crystalline materials - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - II-VI semiconductors - Metals - Organic polymers - Organometallics - Photocatalysis - Scaffolds - Sodium compounds - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yan, Zhiying ",10.1007/s11270-015-2420-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15732932,,,,00496979,6,"June 26, 2015",English,Solutions,,41.0,,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,"Water, Air, and Soil Pollution",,Solar light photocatalytic degradation of nitrite in aqueous solution over CdS embedded on metal-organic frameworks,,Metal organic framework - Neutral aqueous solution - Nitrite - Photo catalytic degradation - Photocatalytic activities - Sacrificial reagent - Simulated solar light - Uv-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum,226,
Lect. Notes Inst. Comput. Sci. Soc. Informatics Telecommun. Eng.,"The statistical supervised learning model for question classification needs a large amount of labeled training examples. However, labeled data are difficult to collected but unlabeled data are readily obtained. To solve the lack of labeled data, we utilize the method of transfer learning to build the learning model with the labeled and the unlabeled training examples. Based on the feature spaces of source and target domain, the common space are build. Then, those examples from source domain whose conditional probability is like to be similar to the target domain are selected into the common space. Therefore, the question classifier is trained by the labeled data in the source domain and the unlabeled data in the target domain. Meanwhile, the method of Map/Reduce based on the Hadoop platform is used to reduce the time complexity in kernel mapping. The subtasks are constructed for the mapping process and then the final result is obtained by assembling the subtasks. Experiments on question classification show that the proposed method could improve the classification accuracy. Furthermore, the learning model based on the Hadoop Platform could ask each computing resources to reduce the running time. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2015",,,20151100645577,,"Qi, Xiang Xiang (1); Su, Lei (1); Yang, Bin (1); Chen, Jun (2); Li, Yiyang (1); Liu, Junhui (2) ","(1) School of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",,405.3 Surveying - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems,114219.0,"October 19, 2014 - October 21, 2014","Guilin, China","5th International Conference on Cloud Computing, CloudComp 2014",Cloud computing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Su, Lei(s28341@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-16050-4_10,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783319160498.0,18678211,,2015,English,Mapping,,12.0,107-115,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",Guilin University of Aerospace Technology; Guilin University of Electronic Technology,Question classification based on hadoop platform,,Classification accuracy - Computing resource - Conditional probabilities - Hadoop platforms - Kernel mapping - Question Answering - Question classification - Transfer learning,142,"Cloud Computing - 5th International Conference, CloudComp 2014, Revised Selected Papers"

Dianwang Jishu,"Based on multi-resolution singular spectrum entropy and supporting vector machine (SVM), a transient protection principle method for UHVDC transmission is proposed, by which the faults located outside or inside the protection zone of the local side can be accurately distinguished from the fault located outside the protection zone of the opposite side. The singular spectrum entropy of different layers is obtained by multi-scale wavelet transform decomposition, and the characteristic vector of each layer is composed of the singular spectrum entropy of each layer, which is divided into training set and test set. The training set is trained to achieve the parameters of SVM classifier, which are tested by the test set, and the prediction results are the classification of the faults located at different positions. A lot of simulation results show that the multi-resolution singular spectrum entropy and SVM based method can reliably recognize the faults located outside or inside the protection zone of the local side and the fault located outside the protection zone at opposite side as well. ©, 2015, Power System Technology Press.

Rare Met.,"Boron removal from metallurgical-grade silicon (MG-Si) using CaO–SiO2slag was studied by employing a medium-frequency electromagnetic induction furnace. The relationship between the optical basicity (Λ) of the CaO–SiO2slag and the distribution coefficient of boron (LB) was investigated. Consequently, the local minimum and maximum LBvalues of 0.72 and 1.58 are obtained when Λ = 0.56 and Λ = 0.71, respectively. The boron content in MG-Si decreases gradually with refinement time increasing, down to a minimum value of 4.73 × 10−6. The controlling step in the removal of boron from MG-Si is not the chemical reaction at the interface of the slag and silicon. Instead, the controlling step is a diffusion mass transfer, in which boron impurities diffuse from molten silicon to the interface of the slag and silicon, or B2O3formed by the chemical reaction diffuses from the slag–silicon interface to molten slag. © 2015, The Nonferrous Metals Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20152300902432,,"Wei, Kui-Xian (1); Lu, Hai-Fei (1); Ma, Wen-Hui (1, 2); Li, Yan-Long (1); Ding, Zhao (2); Wu, Ji-Jun (1); Dai, Yong-Nian (1, 2) ","(1) The National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy and State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Clean Utilization, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory for Nonferrous Vacuum Metallurgy of Yunnan Province and Engineering Research Center for Silicon Metallurgy and Silicon Materials of Yunnan Provincial Universities, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",RARME8,"531.1 Metallurgy - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.3 Mass Transfer - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 801.1 Chemistry, General - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally",,,,,Alkalinity - Boron - Chemical reactions - Electromagnetic induction - Mass transfer - Metallurgy - Refining - Silica - Silicon - Slags,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ma, Wen-Hui(mwhsilicon@163.com) ",10.1007/s12598-015-0496-3,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18677185,,,,10010521,7,"July 19, 2015",English,Silicon oxides,,22.0,522-526,,2015,University of Science and Technology Beijing,Rare Metals,,Boron removal from metallurgical-grade silicon by CaO–SiO2slag refining,,Boron removal - Controlling steps - Distribution coefficient - Medium frequencies - Metallurgical grade silicons (MGSi) - Optical basicity - Silicon interface - Slag refining,34,
Dianli Xitong Zidonghue,"The service life of an oil-immersed power transformer is determined by its insulation condition. In order to preferably apply the time domain dielectric response method and frequency domain dielectric response method to nondestructively assessing the insulation condition of transformer oil-paper insulation, the polarization and depolarization current (PDC) and frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) of a 500 kV-transformer which is out of service are measured first, then the time domain dielectric characteristic (TDDC) and the frequency domain dielectric characteristic (FDDC), which represent the insulation condition of oil-paper insulation, are extracted by the blending method of time domain dielectric response and FDS technique. Finally, the variation rules of TDDC and FDDC are illustrated in detail.

RSC Adv.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves a complex interplay between multiple pathogenic genes that leads to a complex pathogenesis; its diagnosis and treatment remain significantly challenging. Here, we developed an integrated network biology approach to identify disease risk functional modules and pathogenic genes associated with CAD risk. First, we selected 72 known disease genes from the OMIM, GAD, and DO databases as an initial set of seed genes. We retrieved PPI data from HPRD to expand this gene set into a CAD-PPI gene network based on direct interactions and then performed topology analysis for this CAD-PPI gene network. Second, we utilized an MCL algorithm to identify 49 susceptible modules with high modularity. Third, we used functional consistency analysis to further identify 23 risk functional modules. Finally, according to existing cascades of known disease genes in KEGG pathways, we identified 82 pathogenic genes that are either directly or indirectly associated with CAD risk. Based on previous reports, 37 of our identified genes are involved in the development of CAD, whereas the other 45 genes remain to be associated with CAD by experimental evidence. Taken together, our results will provide a better understanding of CAD pathogenesis as well as new insights into its prognosis and treatment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20154201379007,,"Nie, Wennan (1); Lv, Yana (2, 3); Yan, Leyu (2); Guan, Tianbing (1); Li, Qiang (1); Guo, Xiaojuan (1); Liu, Wenhu (1); Feng, Mengpei (1); Xu, Guang (1); Chen, Xi (2, 3, 4); Lv, Haitao (1, 5) ","(1) Chongqing University Innovative Drug Research Centre, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing; 401331, China (2) Yunnan Branch, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Jinghong; 666100, China (3) Key Laboratory of Dai, Southern Medicine of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Jinghong; 666100, China (4) Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing; 100193, China (5) Tissue Repair and Regeneration Program, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane; QLD 4059, Australia ",RSCACL,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 722 Computer Systems and Equipment - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention,,,,,Complex networks - Computer aided diagnosis - Genes - Risk assessment,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Xi(chenxi@implad.ac.cn) ",10.1039/c5ra01920f,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,33,2015,English,Diseases,,54.0,26443-26451,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Discovery and characterization of functional modules and pathogenic genes associated with the risk of coronary artery disease,,Consistency analysis - Coronary artery disease - Direct interactions - Experimental evidence - Functional modules - Initial set of seeds - Integrated networks - Topology analysis,5,

Int. J. Distrib. Sens. Netw.,"Context-aware recommender systems generate more relevant recommendations by adapting them to the specific contextual situation of the user and have become one of the most active research areas in the recommender systems. However, there remains a key issue as how contextual information can be used to create intelligent and useful recommender systems. To assist the development and use of context-aware recommendation capabilities, we propose a graph-based framework to model and incorporate contextual information into the recommendation process in an advantageous way. A contextual graph-based relevance measure (CGR) is specifically designed to assess the potential relevance between the target user and the items further used to make an item recommendation. We also propose a probabilistic-based postfiltering strategy to refine the recommendation results as contextual conditions are explicitly given in a query. Depending on the experimental results on the two datasets, the CGR-based method is much superior to the traditional collaborative filtering methods, and the proposed postfiltering method is much effective in context-aware recommendation scenario. © 2015 Hao Wu et al.",,Open Access,20153801286430,613612.0,"Wu, Hao (1); Yue, Kun (1); Liu, Xiaoxin (1); Pei, Yijian (1); Li, Bo (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,723.5 Computer Applications - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis,,,,,Collaborative filtering - Recommender systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Hao(haowu@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1155/2015/613612,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15501477,,,,15501329,,2015,English,Graphic methods,,22.0,,,2015,Hindawi Limited,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,,Context-aware recommendation via graph-based contextual modeling and postfiltering,,Collaborative filtering methods - Context-aware recommendations - Context-aware recommender systems - Contextual graph - Contextual information - Contextual modeling - Post-filtering - Relevance measure,2015,

RSC Adv.,"Functionalized graphene quantum dot (GQD) based materials play an important role in the development of high-performance, low-cost, large-area optoelectronic devices. The progress, however, is impeded by the poor understanding of the physical mechanism for GQDs in these devices. In this paper, chlorine doped GQD (Cl-GQD) based photovoltaic photodetectors have been fabricated using a solution process, and it was found that the presence of Cl-GQDs can significantly enhance the performance of the device. The improved performance of Cl-GQD based devices has been investigated by systematically studying the structural, morphological, optical, electrical, electrochemical and photoelectrical properties. The important photovoltaic detectors parameters such as the saturation current densities (J0), barrier heights (Φb), built-in potentials (Vbi), carrier concentrations (N) and depletion layer widths (Wd) have been calculated and discussed by studying the I-V and C-V characteristics under different illuminations. The frequency dependent capacitance and conductance have also been discussed. The results provide guidance for developing high-performance graphene based optoelectronic devices.

Sci. Total Environ.,"Water quality management and load reduction are subject to inherent uncertainties in watershed systems and competing decision objectives. Therefore, optimal decision-making modeling in watershed load reduction is suffering due to the following challenges: (a) it is difficult to obtain absolutely 'optimal' solutions, and (b) decision schemes may be vulnerable to failure. The probability that solutions are feasible under uncertainties is defined as reliability. A reliability-oriented multi-objective (ROMO) decision-making approach was proposed in this study for optimal decision making with stochastic parameters and multiple decision reliability objectives. Lake Dianchi, one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China, was examined as a case study for optimal watershed nutrient load reduction to restore lake water quality. This study aimed to maximize reliability levels from considerations of cost and load reductions. The Pareto solutions of the ROMO optimization model were generated with the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, demonstrating schemes representing different biases towards reliability. The Pareto fronts of six maximum allowable emission (MAE) scenarios were obtained, which indicated that decisions may be unreliable under unpractical load reduction requirements. A decision scheme identification process was conducted using the back propagation neural network (BPNN) method to provide a shortcut for identifying schemes at specific reliability levels for decision makers. The model results indicated that the ROMO approach can offer decision makers great insights into reliability tradeoffs and can thus help them to avoid ineffective decisions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20150700534743,,"Dong, Feifei (1); Liu, Yong (1, 4); Su, Han (1); Zou, Rui (2, 3); Guo, Huaicheng (1) ","(1) College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (MOE), Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) Tetra Tech, Inc., 10306 Eaton Place, Ste 340, Fairfax; VA; 22030, United States (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China (4) Institute of Water Sciences, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China ",STEVA8,444 Water Resources - 444.1 Surface Water - 445.2 Water Analysis - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 912.2 Management - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Backpropagation algorithms - Evolutionary algorithms - Lakes - Neural networks - Reliability - Stochastic systems - Torsional stress - Water conservation - Water management - Water quality - Watersheds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Yong(yongliu@pku.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.02.024,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18791026,"Number: 20120001110056, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: CICREQ, Sponsor: Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality; Number: 41222002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41222002 ), the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China ( 20120001110056 ), and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Regional Environmental Quality .

Adv. J. Food Sci. Technol.,"Freeze-Dried Powder of Bamboo Juice (FDPBJ) has high edible and medicinal values for abundant polyphenols, terpenoids and other biologically active ingredients. They can lower cholesterol level, regulate fat influent metabolism, prevent and cure Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) and so on. The aims of study are to research the lipid metabolism effects of FDPBJ and to develop a new type of raw material for the treatment of fat metabolism diseases. In this research, an accurate, sensitive and rapid in vitro model, steatosis hepatic L02 cell, was applied to assay the activities of FDPBJ on lipid metabolism. The steatosis L02 cells were obtained after being cultured with 1% fat emulsion-10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h. Contents of triglyceride (TG), Total Cholesterol (TC) and Free Fatty Acid (FFA) in L02 cells were determined after exposure. The results showed that the intracellular TG content was increased from 33.83±2.32 mmol/L to 40.67±2.73 mmol/L in steatosis L02 cells, while the intracellular TC content was increased from 3.48±0.57 mmol/L to 8.83±0.72 mmol/L. At the same time, the exposure of FDPBJ could reduce the TG, TC and FFA contents in steatosis L02 cells significantly. FDPBJ displayed a distinct TG regulation activity and TC regulation activity. In terms of morphology, FDPBJ can clearly reduce the accumulation of lipid droplets in the steatosis liver cell line L02. On account of these in vitro results, FDPBJ might have satisfactory effects in clinic treatment of fat metabolism disease characterized by the elevation of TG and TC. © 2015 Maxwell Scientific Publication Corp.",,Open Access,20160801986825,,"Du, Ping (1); Huang, Xing-jian (4); Wang, Tie-Dan (1); Huang, Shao-Jun (1); Shan, Yun (1); Yu, Jie (3); Yang, Fang (2) ","(1) Research Center for Analysis and Measurement, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (2) Key Laboratory for Green Chemical Process of Ministry of Education, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, China (3) College of Pharmacy, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China (4) College of Food Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China ",,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 Biology - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 811.1 Pulp and Paper,,,,,Bamboo - Cell culture - Cholesterol - Cytology - Diseases - Emulsification - Fatty acids - Lipids - Metabolism - Physiology,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yang, Fang ",10.19026/ajfst.9.1642,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20424876,,,,20424868,11,2015,English,Cells,,25.0,854-859,,2015,Maxwell Science Publications,Advance Journal of Food Science and Technology,,Lipid metabolism effects of Freeze-Dried Powder of Bamboo Juice on liver cell line L02 with steatosis,,Fatty liver disease - Human liver cells - Lipid metabolisms - Polyphenols - Terpenoids,9,

Mater. Res. Innov.,"TiO2nanopillars (NPs) rooted in Ti were cultivated hydrothermally with the strongest organic base tetramethylammoniumhydroxide (TMAOH) in aqueous solution in Ti substrate. TiCl4was used to coat TiO2NPs with a nanoscale compact thin TiO2layer against charge recombination with oxidised species in electrolyte. A consecutive layer of CdSe nanoparticles was induced by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) mode for sensitisation by light harvesting. J-V curves surprisingly indicate that untreated TiO2NPs photoanode rooted in Ti produces considerable currents in the dark (thermal photovoltaic power generation) even higher compared to that under intense UV illumination, signifying TiCl4-CdSe treatment does not profit. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fitting parameters further reveal that the parameters associated with injection and recombination issues have been improved, as a comprehensive electrochemical result of TiCl4-CdSe treatment. Thus, the current-limiting problem probably arises from the remarkable continuous absorption bands in a wide spectrum range from visible to far-infrared, which is confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectra. However, the reason for the substantial photocurrent-limiting is that the intense irradiating UV light causes the innumerable electrons distributed in the inter-band-gap states to transit to much higher levels above the CB edge of TiO2with excessive energy, then they collide with TiO2crystall lattices to release thermal energy eventually to raise the transport resistance. © W.

Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"Low frequency oscillation may occur when the connection between regional grids containing many small hydropower stations and the backbone grid is weak. Connecting small hydropower girds to the backbone gird asynchronously by voltage source converter based high voltage direct current transmission (VSC-HVDC) can eliminate the low frequency oscillation. However, the small hydropower grids are weak AC systems, and it is necessary for VSC-HVDCs to participate in controlling the AC voltage and the frequency of the weak systems. A VSC-HVDC AC voltage-frequency coordination control strategy for improving AC system transient stability was proposed. In the strategy, the first objective is to ensure the safety of the VSC-HVDC equipment, the second objective is to improve the AC voltage stability, and the third objective is to improve the frequency stability. The designed controller structure can guarantee that the objectives are implemented in order of priority. A practical case analysis of Yunnan grid demonstrated that the VSC-HVDC connection scheme can improve the small-signal stability of the whole system and the proposed strategy can enhance the transient stability of the weak AC system. © 2015 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.",,,20154401462325,,"Liu, Sheng (1); Xu, Zheng (1); Li, Wenyun (2); Wu, Chen (2); Wang, Xinggang (2); Li, Lingfang (2); You, Guangzeng (2) ","(1) College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; Zhejiang Province; 310027, China (2) Yunnan Power Grid Co., Ltd., Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650011, China ",ZDGXER,611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission - 706.1.2 Electric Power Distribution - 731.4 System Stability,,,,,Control system stability - HVDC power transmission - Hydroelectric power - Power quality - Stability,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.13334/j.0258-8013.pcsee.2015.19.005,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,02588013,19,"October 5, 2015",Chinese,Transients,,23.0,4879-4887,,2015,Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering,Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao/Proceedings of the Chinese Society of Electrical Engineering,,VSC-HVDC AC voltage-frequency coordination control strategy for improving AC system transient stability,,Coordination control - High voltage direct current transmission - Low frequency oscillations - Small hydro power - Small hydropower stations - Voltage source converters - VSC-HVDC - Weak AC system,35,
Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Data in probabilistic databases may not be absolutely correct, and worse, may be erroneous. Many existing data cleaning methods can be used to detect errors in traditional databases, but they fall short of guiding us to find errors in probabilistic databases, especially for databases with complex correlations among data. In this paper, we propose a method for tracing errors in probabilistic databases by adopting Bayesian network (BN) as the framework of representing the correlations among data. We first develop the techniques to construct an augmented Bayesian network (ABN) for an anomalous query to represent correlations among input data, intermediate data and output data in the query execution. Inspired by the notion of blame in causal models, we then define a notion of blame for ranking candidate errors. Next, we provide an efficient method for computing the degree of blame for each candidate error based on the probabilistic inference upon the ABN. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland, All rights Reserved.",,,20154001332961,,"Duan, Liang (1); Yue, Kun (1); Jin, Cheqing (2); Xu, Wenlin (1); Liu, Weiyi (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Institute of Massive Computing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China ",,"723.3 Database Systems - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",142199.0,"April 20, 2015 - April 23, 2015","Hanoi, Viet nam","20th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications, DASFAA 2015",Barium compounds - Bayesian networks - Errors - Query processing,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yue, Kun(kyue@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/978-3-319-18123-3_7,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319181226.0,03029743,,2015,English,Database systems,"Database Systems for Advanced Applications - 20th International Conference, DASFAA 2015, Hanoi, Vietnam, April 20-23, 2015 Proceedings, Part II",38.0,104-119,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Database Systems for Advanced Applications; Hanoi University of Science and Technology; School of Information and Communication Technology,Tracing errors in probabilistic databases based on the Bayesian network,,Causal model - Complex correlation - Data cleaning - Effectiveness and efficiencies - Probabilistic database - Probabilistic inference - Query execution - Rejection samplings,9050,

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Multiple objects tracking in dynamic background is one of the key techniques in computer vision. An improved method of multiple objects tracking based on a combination of Camshift and object trajectory tracking is presented in this paper. The algorithm uses Harris corner matching to estimate background movement parameters, adopts two-frame difference to detect moving objects, combines object trajectory tracking with Camshift track moving objects. Our improved algorithm can achieve satisfactory effect not only in tracking multiple objects, but also in tracking continuously the objects which are static, re-enter the current scene or recover motion.

Mater Sci Semicond Process,"Abstract The surface fluorinated TiO2/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposites (denoted as FTG) were synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that, the anatase TiO2nanoparticles were well dispersed on RGO sheets, and there was a C-Ti bond in FTG. Moreover, the F-was adsorbed on the surface of TiO2, and generated the stable F-Ti bonds. The adsorption ability and photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites was evaluated by degradation of 17β-estradiol (E2) and 17α-ethynyl-estradiol (EE2) under UV light illumination. The removal ratio was strongly affected by the mass ratio of RGO in FTG, and the optimal mass ratio of RGO for both E2 and EE2 was 4.0 wt% (FTG-4). Further more, the presence of F-enhanced the photocatalytic activity effectively. Under the optimal degradation conditions, the total removal ratios of E2 over FTG-4, TiO2/4 wt% RGO (denoted as TG, without adding hydrofluoric acid) and P25 (Commercial TiO2) were 99.8%, 83.3% and 74.4%, respectively. And the total removal ratios of EE2 over the same catalysts were 99.7%, 82.6% and 75.6%, respectively. The results indicated that FTG exhibited much higher efficient removal ability for estrogens compared to TG and P25. The introduction of GO in the TiO2can enhance the adsorption ability for estrogens, meanwhile, GO and the F-can both improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2for degradation of estrogens greatly. Further more, the prepared catalyst was found to be reusable. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152901033266,,"Yang, Ye (1); Luo, Lijun (1, 2); Xiao, Ming (3); Li, Han (3); Pan, Xuejun (1); Jiang, Fengzhi (3) ","(1) Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Education Department of Yunnan, School of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Yunnan MinZu University, Kunming; 650500, China (3) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Graphene - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Hydrofluoric acid - Hydrothermal synthesis - Nanocomposites - Photocatalysis - Photocatalysts - Titanium dioxide - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pan, Xuejun(xjpan@kmust.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.mssp.2015.06.012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 21163023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21261026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21163023 ) and ( 21261026 ).,,13698001,,"July 14, 2015",English,X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,,73.0,183-193,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing,,One-step hydrothermal synthesis of surface fluorinated TiO2/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites for photocatalytic degradation of estrogens,,Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles - Degradation condition - Estrogens - Graphene oxide nanocomposites - Hydrothermal methods - Photo catalytic degradation - Photocatalytic activities - Reduced graphene oxides,40,
Gaodianya Jishu,"Analyzing the failure risk for power equipment is a necessary means to ensure safe and economical operation of power equipment, and it is the foundation to control the risk of the power grid. We put forward a failure risk analysis method based on failure mode, with a combination use of causal network diagram, bow-tie model, and semi-Markov process. Firstly, based on failure cases and expertise, the causes and consequences of power equipment common failure modes are analyzed through causal network diagram. This is the theoretical basis of risk analysis. Secondly, for the present possible failure mode, its location in the causal network diagram is determined, the reasons forward are explored, and the consequences backward are predicted. This two-way analysis of the failure mode forms a bow-tie model, which can qualitatively analyze the failure development process. Finally, the failure development process is divided into different states to establish a semi-Markov process model. Therefore, the failure risk is quantified, and a failure risk curve over time is obtained. The failure evolution and quantified value of risk can be obtained by the failure analysis method based on failure mode, serving for power equipment risk control accordingly. © 2015, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPI.

Ecol. Eng.,"In this study, the multi-dimensional critical regulation control (MCRC) modes and water allocation for irrigation system were studied in the middle reaches of Heihe River basin, China, to coordinate the water contradiction of agricultural irrigation and ecological irrigation. Based on the key indexes of five dimensions, including water resources, ecological environment, society, economy and water-saving measures, 320 schemes of three regulation control levels were generated and analyzed, then the optimal modes were obtained by introducing entropy theory and synergetic theory, thus the corresponding thresholds were obtained meanwhile. Based on the parameters of the most optimal irrigation system regulation control modes, an inexact multi-stage stochastic programming (IMSP) model for water resources optimal allocation of the 12 major irrigation districts in the middle reaches of Heihe River basin was developed and the corresponding results were obtained. This paper gives the optimal MRCR modes and water resources allocation plans from a different perspective by considering the ecological environment protection and agricultural water-saving.

Landsc. Urban Plann.,"Worldwide, large areas of the tropics are transformed into simplified ecosystems characterised by altered tree species composition and diversity. Human activities in these landscapes have a strong effect on the land cover and exert a selective force on tree species and functional traits, hereby potentially shaping the distribution of ecosystem services in the landscape. The aim of this study was to asses how the land use determines tree species assemblages, their associated traits and potential ecosystem services, which was studied for 589 systematically sampled locations in the Afromontane highlands of Taita Hills (SE Kenya). Several tree traits were non-random distributed in the human-dominated landscape. For instance, on croplands (70% of the sampled locations) belonged 66.5% of the observed species to the exotic tree species group. This group was characterised by significantly larger seeds and fruits, corresponding with the abundance of many fruit trees. Also three functional traits (i.e. economic function, nitrogen fixation and agroforestry potential) were clearly associated with this group. The cloud forest tree species group and small-leaved indigenous group were significantly more present on woodes sites and homesteads (~42%). However, no functional traits were unique for both indigenous groups, implying that farmers may exchange them by exotics, which could be catalysed by the loss of local knowledge about indigenous tree resources and benefits. Other indigenous species, including endemic or late-successional species were rare or absent in the matrix and their conservation can only be guaranteed by protecting the remaining indigenous forest fragments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20153601248983,,"Thijs, Koen W.

Anal. Chim. Acta,"The application of macrocyclic hosts for construction of different electrochemical devices and separation matrices has attracted much attentions due to their benign biocompatibility and simplicity of synthesis. Myricetin and rutin are considered two of the most bioactive flavonoids, which have been proved to exhibit various physiological functions. This work reports a simple and facile approach for the synthesis of β-cyclodextrin-gold at 3, 4, 9, 10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid functionalized single-walled carbon nanohorns (β-CD-Au at PTCA-SWCNHs) nanohybrids. The simultaneous electrochemical determination of myricetin and rutin using a β-CD-Au at PTCA-SWCNHs-modified glassy carbon electrode was established. The results show that the β-CD-Au at PTCA-SWCNHs-modified electrode displayed electrochemical signal superior to those of Au at PTCA-;SWCNHs and SWCNHs towards myricetin and rutin. The proposed modified electrode has a linear response range of 0.01-10.00 μM both for myricetin and rutin with relatively low detection limits of 0.0038 μM for myricetin and 0.0044 μM (S/N = 3) for rutin, respectively. The excellent performance of the sensing platform is considered to be the synergic effects of the SWCNHs (e.g. their good electrochemical properties and large surface area) and β-CD (e.g. a hydrophilic external surface, a high supramolecular recognition, and a good enrichment capability). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20153701253882,,"Ran, Xin (1); Yang, Long (1); Zhang, Jianqiang (1); Deng, Guogang (1); Li, Yucong (1); Xie, Xiaoguang (1); Zhao, Hui (2); Li, Can-Peng (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-resource, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",ACACAM,461.9.1 Immunology - 547.1 Precious Metals - 704.1 Electric Components - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Alcohols - Biocompatibility - Carbon - Cyclodextrins - Electrochemical sensors - Flavonoids - Glass membrane electrodes - Gold - Nanohorns - Supramolecular chemistry,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Can-Peng(lcppp1974@sina.com) ",10.1016/j.aca.2015.08.046,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734324,"Number: 2014RA022, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2012FB112, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 21565029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31160334, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21565029 , 31160334 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province ( 2012FB112 , 2014RA022 ), People's Republic of China.

For. Ecol. Manage.,"Litterfall plays an important role in nutrient cycling and maintenance of soil fertility in terrestrial ecosystems. Annual and seasonal variation in litterfall have been investigated in various habitats, however, seasonality in nutrient supply is less well documented. We studied litterfall over two years and seasonal litter nutrient input over one year across a tropical disturbance gradient from mature forest to monoculture tea plantation. Total litter production in the mature forests and regenerating forests was not significantly different. However, tea plantations had significantly lower litter production. Total litterfall in forest habitats showed a clear seasonal pattern with a peak during the dry season (Mar.-May), as has been reported for other tropical seasonal forests. Contrary to expectations, there was no significant difference in litter nutrient concentrations across the disturbance gradient, although there was a substantial change in plant species composition. Litter nutrient concentrations also did not vary significantly across seasons, again contrary to our expectations. Thus, nutrient input was driven solely by the seasonal litterfall pattern. Our results suggest that at a landscape scale turnover in species composition linked to anthropogenic disturbance may not always lead to changes in litter quality, presumably because a similar spectra of leaf types may exist across communities. Seasonal litterfall patterns, which have been more commonly studied, may prove a reasonable proxy for nutrient input in forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20152300907541,,"Paudel, Ekananda (1, 2, 3, 4); Dossa, Gbadamassi G.O.

J Alloys Compd,"First-principles calculations are used to investigate the ferromagnetism of N-doped BiFeO3(BFO). It is found that one N atom doped BFO at O site can produce a total magnetic moment of 1 μBcompared with the no magnetic moment in the perfect BFO. The magnetic moment originates from the destroyed antiferromagnetic spin arrangement of Fe ions, the spin-polarized N and O atoms. Systematic study of electronic structure further indicated that the magnetism is attributed to the holes in the N-2p, O-2p and Fe-3d states induced by N substitution for O atom. Total energy calculations show that the N impurities tended to ferromagnetic alignment in BFO. Magnetism is also investigated with the appearance of intrinsic defects (Bi and O vacancies) in N-doped BFO, we found that Bi vacancies are beneficial for enhancing the ferromagnetism while O vacancies are the opposite. The enhanced ferromagnetism obtained by N doping indicating a promising way for improving multiferroic properties of BFO. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,20151900835803,,"Wang, Q.J.

Math. Probl. Eng.,"In view of the problems of uneven distribution of reality fault samples and dimension reduction effect of locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which is easily affected by neighboring points, an improved local linear embedding algorithm of homogenization distance (HLLE) is developed. The method makes the overall distribution of sample points tend to be homogenization and reduces the influence of neighboring points using homogenization distance instead of the traditional Euclidean distance. It is helpful to choose effective neighboring points to construct weight matrix for dimension reduction. Because the fault recognition performance improvement of HLLE is limited and unstable, the paper further proposes a new local linear embedding algorithm of supervision and homogenization distance (SHLLE) by adding the supervised learning mechanism. On the basis of homogenization distance, supervised learning increases the category information of sample points so that the same category of sample points will be gathered and the heterogeneous category of sample points will be scattered. It effectively improves the performance of fault diagnosis and maintains stability at the same time. A comparison of the methods mentioned above was made by simulation experiment with rotor system fault diagnosis, and the results show that SHLLE algorithm has superior fault recognition performance. © 2015 Guangbin Wang et al.",,Open Access,20154401469769,981598.0,"Wang, Guangbin (1); Luo, Jun (1); He, Yilin (1); Chen, Qinyi (2) ","(1) Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Health Maintenance for Mechanical Equipment, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan Road No. 2, Xiangtan City, Hunan; 411201, China (2) ChuXiong Industrial School, Weichu Road No. 84, Chuxiong City, Yunnan; 675099, China ",,921 Mathematics,,,,,Failure analysis - Homogenization method - Supervised learning,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Guangbin(jxxwgb@126.com) ",10.1155/2015/981598,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15635147,,,,1024123X,,2015,English,Fault detection,,14.0,,,2015,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,Fault Diagnosis of Supervision and Homogenization Distance Based on Local Linear Embedding Algorithm,,Dimension reduction - Euclidean distance - Fault recognition - Local Linear Embedding - Locally linear embedding algorithms - Neighboring point - Performance improvements - Weight matrices,2015,

Herein, a simple yet innovative biosensor for Pb2+detection is presented. The sensor is developed by the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) core-satellite structure using naturally occurring tripeptide glutathione (GSH) as linker. The addition of Pb2+caused a red-to-blue color change and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band was shifted to ca. 650nm. The limit of detection (LOD) is found to be 47.6nM (9.9ppb) by UV-vis spectroscopy with high selectivity against other heavy metals.

Proc. Int. Conf. Doc. Anal. Recognit.,"Chart classification is the foundation of chart analysis and document understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to classify charts by combining convolutional networks and deep belief networks. In the framework, we firstly extract deep hidden features of charts, which are taken from the fully-connected layer of deep convolutional networks. We then utilize deep belief networks to predict the labels of the charts based on their deep hidden features. The convolutional networks are initialized using a large number of natural images and fine-tuned using the chart images to prevent overfitting. Compared with previous methods using primitive feature extraction, the deep features give our framework better scalability and stability. We collect a 5-class chart dataset with more than 5000 images and show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods greatly. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161302146463,7333872.0,"Liu, Xiao (1); Tang, Binbin (1); Wang, Zhenyang (1); Xu, Xianghua (2); Pu, Shiliang (3); Tao, Dapeng (4); Song, Mingli (1) ","(1) College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (2) College of Computer Science, Hangdian University, Hangzhou; 310027, China (3) HIK VISION, Hangzhou; 310027, China (4) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650000, China ",,716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 903.3 Information Retrieval and Use,118256.0,"August 23, 2015 - August 26, 2015","Nancy, France","13th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR 2015",Convolution,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICDAR.2015.7333872,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479918058.0,15205363,,"November 20, 2015",English,Information retrieval systems,"13th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR 2015 - Conference Proceedings",21.0,801-805,1of1,2015,IEEE Computer Society,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR",ABBYY; Google; iTESOFT; MyScript; Yooz,Chart classification by combining deep convolutional networks and deep belief networks,,Chart analysis - Convolutional networks - Deep belief networks - Document understanding - Fully-connected layers - Natural images - Overfitting,2015-November,

Tob. Sci. Technol.,"Using principal component analysis, we developed an index of aroma type and aroma note (ATNI) for flue-cured bobacco on the basis of cigarette sensory smoking test data. The index was able to quantitatively guide the identification of aroma type and aroma note as determined by human sensory method. Statistical analysis indicated that the ATNI can accurately and quantitatively help categorize flue-cured tobaccos based on their aroma characteristics. The impacts of three meteorological factors (sunshine hours, temperature, and humidity) were also studied during tobacco transplanting, rosette, fast-growing, and leaf-maturity periods on aroma type and aroma note of flue-cured tobacco, using a correlation analysis and a ridge regression model. The results indicated that the different meteorological factors had varying effects on the aroma type and aroma note during the different growing periods. The synergistic effect of meteorological factors explained more than half of the total variance in ATNI. Among the four field growing periods, the leaf-maturity period was the key for the formation of aroma type and aroma note. The most important meteorological factors during the key period were sunshine hours and temperature. Under normal growth conditions, shorter sunshine hours with lower temperatures during the leaf-maturity period promoted a clear aroma with fresh sweetness note. In contrast, longer sunshine hours and higher temperatures during the leaf-maturity period benefitted a full-body aroma type with burnt sweetness note. In conclusion, the new developed ATNI can well explain the flue-cured tobacco aroma characteristics, and the key meteorological factors affecting ATNI are temperature and sunshine hours through correlation analysis. © 2015, Editorial Office of Tobacco Science and Technology.

Renew. Energy,"With the high growth urbanization and increasing new urban population, the huge demand for infrastructures and dwellings has become a great challenge for the sustainable development in Chinese cities. The building sector shares one fourth of total energy consumption in the country and plays an important role in reducing the energy consumption and the consequential green house gas (GHG) emissions. Some policies have been issued for promoting the low carbon sustainable development in China's buildings. However, existing barriers especially the investment barriers substantially prevent the low carbon technologies and service from being employed effectively. The carbon trading scheme of cap-and-trade is now widely accepted as one cost-effective way to deal with the climate change issue in the world, and it can be utilized for overcoming the barriers to carbon reduction activities in China's building sector. A new Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) energy performance based method is designed for reducing transaction costs in implementing CDM projects in China's buildings before 2020. And then a 'step by step' approach is formed to establish the domestic and international carbon trading mechanism to effectively reduce GHG missions in China's building sector after 2020. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152801010744,,"Chen, Yihui (1, 2); Jiang, Ping (3); Dong, Wenbo (3); Huang, Beijia (4) ","(1) School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China (2) Yunnan Institute of Environment Science, Kunming 650034, China (3) Department of Environmental Science and Engineering/Fudan Tyndall Centre, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China (4) College of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai 200093, China ",,402 Buildings and Towers - 403 Urban and Regional Planning and Development - 403.1 Urban Planning and Development - 451 Air Pollution - 525 Energy Management and Conversion - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Buildings - Climate change - Cost effectiveness - Cost reduction - Energy conservation - Energy policy - Energy utilization - Gas emissions - Greenhouse gases - Intelligent buildings - Investments - Planning - Population statistics - Sustainable development - Urban growth,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Jiang, Ping ",10.1016/j.renene.2015.06.062,Engineering Village,Compendex,Article in Press,18790682,"Number: FTC98503B09a, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Fudan University; ",The study was supported by the funding from Fudan Tyndall Centre of Fudan University ( FTC98503B09a ).

Quat. Res.,"We present a shoreline-based, millennial-scale record of lake-level changes spanning 12.8-2.3. ka for a large closed-basin lake system on the southwestern Tibetan Plateau. Fifty-three radiocarbon and eight U-Th series ages of tufa and beach cement provide age control on paleoshorelines ringing the basin, supplemented by nineteen ages from shell and aquatic plant material from natural exposures generally recording lake regressions. Our results show that paleo-Ngangla Ring Tso exceeded modern lake level (4727. m asl) continuously between ~. 12.8 and 2.3. ka. The lake was at its highstand 135. m (4862. m asl) above the modern lake from 10.3. ka to 8.6. ka. This is similar to other closed-basin lakes in western Tibet, and coincides with peak Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and peak Indian Summer Monsoon intensity. The lake experienced a series of millennial-scale oscillations centered on 11.5, 10.8, 8.3, 5.9 and 3.6. ka, consistent with weak monsoon events in proxy records of the Indian Summer Monsoon. It is unclear whether these events were forced by North Atlantic or Indian Ocean conditions, but based on the abrupt lake-level regressions recorded for Ngangla Ring Tso, they resulted in significant periodic reductions in rainfall over the western Tibetan Plateau throughout the Holocene. © 2014 University of Washington.",,,20144500176284,,"Hudson, Adam M.

In this paper, we propose a novel 3D object recognizing method based on multi-view data fusion, called Multi-view Ensemble Manifold Regularization (MEMR). In this method, we model image features with a regularization term for SVM. To train this modified SVM, multi-view learning is achieved with alternating optimization. Hypergraph construction is used to better capture the connectivity among views. Experimental results show that the accuracy rate has been improved by 20-25%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Proc. - Int. Conf. BioMed. Eng. Informatics, BMEI","Regional pulse wave velocity (PWV) is the preferred index for quantitative evaluation of arterial stiffness locally, and has shown to be high clinical importance for effective prevention and early diagnosis of cardiovascular events. However, there have been far less systematic studies on the accurate performance of the regional PWV measurement along a segment of carotid artery and relevant influence factors. In this paper, an ultrasound simulation model for pulse wave propagation is proposed to investigate the accurate performance of PWV measurement and the influence factors such as beam density and frame rate of ultrasound scanning systemically. 30 sets of B-scan ultrasonic sequence images of carotid artery at different frame rates are simulated for obtaining the corresponding RF ultrasound signals, and then the delay time of pulse wave transit at different locations along the artery segment is calculated by two cross-correlation-based data processes. Finally, the average PWV is calculated from a linear fitting algorithm applied to time-distance relationship of pulse wave. The results show that the estimated PWV of carotid artery based on ultrasound RF signals suffers from errors ranged from 7 % to 11 % The frame rates of ultrasound imaging decreased from 1127 Hz to 376 Hz do not significantly affect the accuracy of PWV measurements, but decreased to 226 Hz would result in much larger measurement errors. Moreover, the accuracy is higher by the linear fitting algorithm based on the pulse wave transiting time from beam positions apart far away. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161702306668,7401506.0,"Deng, Li (1); Zhang, Yufeng (1); Hu, Xiao (1); Gao, Lian (1); Li, Zhiyao (2) ","(1) Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China (2) Department of Ultrasonic Examination, Third Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China ",,461.1 Biomedical Engineering - 461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 751.1 Acoustic Waves,119337.0,"October 14, 2015 - October 16, 2015","Shenyang, China","8th International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, BMEI 2015",Biomedical engineering - Diagnosis - Image segmentation - Ultrasonic imaging - Wave propagation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yufeng ",10.1109/BMEI.2015.7401506,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509000227.0,,,"February 8, 2016",English,Acoustic wave velocity,"Proceedings - 2015 8th International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, BMEI 2015",11.0,229-233,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2015 8th International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics, BMEI 2015",Liaoning Technical University,The assessment of regional pulse wave velocity accuracy of carotid arteries estimated by using cross-correlation of ultrasound beams,,accuracy - Accurate performance - Cross correlations - Pulse wave propagation - Pulse wave velocity - Quantitative evaluation - Radiofrequency signals - Ultrasound simulation,,
ISPRS J. Photogramm. Remote Sens.,"Accurate and timely rice paddy field maps with a fine spatial resolution would greatly improve our understanding of the effects of paddy rice agriculture on greenhouse gases emissions, food and water security, and human health. Rice paddy field maps were developed using optical images with high temporal resolution and coarse spatial resolution (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) or low temporal resolution and high spatial resolution (e.g., Landsat TM/ETM+). In the past, the accuracy and efficiency for rice paddy field mapping at fine spatial resolutions were limited by the poor data availability and image-based algorithms. In this paper, time series MODIS and Landsat ETM+/OLI images, and the pixel- and phenology-based algorithm are used to map paddy rice planting area. The unique physical features of rice paddy fields during the flooding/open-canopy period are captured with the dynamics of vegetation indices, which are then used to identify rice paddy fields. The algorithm is tested in the Sanjiang Plain (path/row 114/27) in China in 2013. The overall accuracy of the resulted map of paddy rice planting area generated by both Landsat ETM+ and OLI is 97.3%, when evaluated with areas of interest (AOIs) derived from geo-referenced field photos. The paddy rice planting area map also agrees reasonably well with the official statistics at the level of state farms (R2=0.94). These results demonstrate that the combination of fine spatial resolution images and the phenology-based algorithm can provide a simple, robust, and automated approach to map the distribution of paddy rice agriculture in a year. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The structure and morphology of the asprepared nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and highresolution TEM. It was indicated that NiO nanoparticles with size of 10–30 nm were tightly decorated on the MWCNTs. A chemoresistive gas sensor using NiO nanoparticles/MWCNTs nanocomposite as sensitive material was fabricated on an alumina tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. The gas-sensing properties of NiO nanoparticles/MWCNTs nanocomposite were evaluated for volatile organic compound vapors (VOCs). The electrical resistance is found to be dramatically decreased by three orders of magnitude compared to a sensor based on NiO nanoparticles free MWCNTs. The highest response values of the nanocomposite were obtained at operating temperature of 180 °C. NiO/MWCNTs sensor shows much better performance compared to the NiO sensor and the VOCs responses are found to be several times higher than that of a NiO nanoparticles sensor. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.",,,20153901304263,,"Chen, Nan (1); Li, Qing (1); Li, Yuxiu (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1, 2); Wang, Yude (1, 2) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 819.4 Fiber Products - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Alumina - Aluminum oxide - Chemical detection - Gas detectors - Gas sensing electrodes - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN) - Nanocomposites - Nanoparticles - Scanning electron microscopy - Synthesis (chemical) - Transmission electron microscopy - Volatile organic compounds - X ray diffraction - Yarn,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1007/s10854-015-3487-0,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1573482X,,,,09574522,10,2015,English,Nickel oxide,,38.0,8240-8248,,2015,Springer New York LLC,Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,,Facile synthesis and gas sensing performances based on nickel oxide nanoparticles/multi-wall carbon nanotube composite,,Carbon-nanotube composites - Chemo-resistive gas sensors - Electrical resistances - Gas sensing properties - Nickel oxide nanoparticle - Operating temperature - Structure and morphology - Three orders of magnitude,26,

A Glbeele-3500 thermal simulator was used to investigate the effect of the deformation amount and the nitrogen content on the precipitation-temperature-time (PTT) curves of the vanadium-containing weathering steel and relationship between the nitrogen content or the deformation amount, temperature and precipitation time was analyzed. It has been found that the PTT curves of test samples are C curve shape. The temperature corresponding to the shortest time of precipitation is also found. Increasing the nitrogen content will make PTT curve move to the left significantly. Additionally, increasing deformation amount can also accelerate the precipitation rate of V (C, N) in the austenite and makes PTT curve move to the left obviously. It has also been found that the more the deformation amount, the shorter the start time of the V (C, N) precipitation.

Tob. Sci. Technol.,"The sensory quality of 337 flue-cured tobacco samples from Yunnan and Fujian harvested in 2012 and 2013 was evaluated, the chemical components of the same were analyzed, and the results were subjected to t test, correlation analysis and regression analysis. The sensory evaluation showed that the samples from both Yunnan and Fujian featured the attribute of fresh flavor style accompanied with the main aroma characteristics of fresh-sweetness, hay-like and burnt scents, and fresh-sweetness scent significantly negatively correlated to green scent. Fresh-sweetness scent was more outstanding in the samples from Yunnan, as was green scent in the samples from Fujian. The results of chemical analysis indicated that the most significant differences were: the potassium content was significantly higher in Fujian samples, while the chlorine content was higher in Yunnan samples. The correlation analysis between aroma note and chemical components showed that the fresh-sweetness and green notes of Yunnan flue-cured tobacco significantly correlated to reducing sugar content, potassium content and potassium/ chlorine ratio, while the fresh-sweetness and green aroma notes of Fujian flue-cured tobacco did not significantly correlate to routine chemical components. Therefore, the green aroma note can be used as an important indicator to distinguish Yunnan flue-cured tobacco from Fujian one. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of Tobacco Science and Technology.

Rock Soil Mech,"Differential weathering can cause unstable rock mass in rock slope with alternating strata. The alternating strata can be sandstone and mudstone and belong to the soft and hard rocks. The rock collapse damage is a common form of geological disasters. This paper uses unstable rock mass at Puerdu as case study. The calculation formula for the compressive stress of unstable hard rock block on the soft mudstone base is derived for the slope rock mass with cavity in the soft mudstone due to differential weathering. The stress increases as the cavity depth increase. According to the slope topography, geomorphology and characteristics of geological structure of unstable rock blocks at Puerdu, two kinds of four unstable rock mechanical models due to differential weathering are established. The first type is the type of mudstone base fracturing damage and rotational damage unstable rock block whose main control fissure connectivity rate is equal to 1. The second type is the type of falling and toppling of unstable rock block whose main control fissure connectivity rate is less than 1. The rock strength theory is used to derive the quadratic parabolic Mohr strength envelope equation for sandstone at the study area. The limit equilibrium theory and Mohr strength theory is used to deduce the collapsing damage and judgment expression of four kinds of unstable rock blocks under the gravity, earthquake force and fissure water pressure. The critical collapse boundary equation is derived for the unstable rock mass at the study area. The relationships among rock cavity depth, thickness, height and the main control fissure depth are also derived. Those results provide an intuitive and reliable basis for the prediction and judgment of stability and collapse of the unstable rock mass. ©, 2015, Academia Sinica.

TMS Annu Meet,"The paper studied the diffusion process of nitrogen and characteristic distribution of iron impurities in the bottom of cast crystalline silicon ingot along the direction of crystal growth. According to the dynamics analysis of the decomposition of Si3N4 coating, the diffusion process of nitrogen into multicrystalline silicon ingot during casting process should be divided into three steps. The diffusion length of nitrogen in multicrystalline silicon ingot is 700 μm. The results of EDS analysis indicate that the distribution characteristic of iron in multicrystalline silicon ingot is concerned with the diffusion process of nitrogen in this length. Based on the above research results, the distribution model of iron in casting multicrystalline silicon ingot was established and verified by the experimental results.

FCTE,"In recent years, financial disasters have emphasized the importance of effective risk management for financial regulators and market practitioners who have become particularly sensitive to changes in the assets’value. The use of quantitative risk measures has become an essential management t ool to be placed inparallel with the models of returns. In this paper, we introduce all kinds of GARCH models and EVT theoriesand apply these methods to measure the exchange rate risk of the Chinese exchange market. Firstly, we examine the heteroscedasticity of the return series of USD/RMB and EUR/RMB data, and the results suggest that there is obvious heteroscedasticity. Secondly, we choose the best GARCH model to filter the return series to i.i.d residual series, and employ extreme value theory to estimate the tails of those i.i.d series; we find the degree of fitting of GPD is very high. Finally, we calculate corresponding VaR estimates, which can help the investor to measure the exchange risk accurately. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group.",,,20155301740308,,"Yang, J. (1); Zhang, S.Z.

IEEE Trans. Neural Networks Learn. Sys.,"Nonparametric kernel learning (NPKL) is a flexible approach to learn the kernel matrix directly without assuming any parametric form. It can be naturally formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), which, however, is not very scalable. To address this problem, we propose the combined use of low-rank approximation and block coordinate descent (BCD). Low-rank approximation avoids the expensive positive semidefinite constraint in the SDP by replacing the kernel matrix variable with VΤV, where V is a low-rank matrix. The resultant nonlinear optimization problem is then solved by BCD, which optimizes each column of V sequentially. It can be shown that the proposed algorithm has nice convergence properties and low computational complexities. Experiments on a number of real-world data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art NPKL solvers. © 2012 IEEE.",,,20153501210609,6928428.0,"Hu, En-Liang (1, 2); Kwok, James T.

Analysis using the solution leads to a conclusion that for a tube with radius at the order of pore size or smaller, tube flow arises dominantly from the Beavers–Joseph condition. For an infinite fine tube, the average velocity approaches the specific flux in the matrix.

RSC Adv.,"Volatile changes and the post-fermentation ageing process of tea remain largely unknown. Additionally, the understanding of ageing and storage processes of tea mostly rely on sensory experience and lack the support of scientific and accurate data. In this paper, a method was developed based on head-space solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) combined with multivariate statistical methods to assess volatile profiles in different types of Pu-erh teas, including raw, ripe and aged Pu-erh teas. A total of 122 aroma components were identified in 57 Pu-erh teas. Differences in the manufacturing method and years in storage of Pu-erh teas resulted in different compositions and contents of volatile components. The characteristic volatiles in aged teas were hexadecanoic acid, dihydroactinidiolide, caffeine, linalool, 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, β-ionone, cedrol, and phytol; the characteristic volatiles in raw teas were linalool, tridecane, caffeine, dihydroactinidiolide, β-ionone, 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, dodecane, etc.; and the characteristic volatiles in ripe teas were 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, hexadecanoic acid, 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, dihydroactinidiolide, 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanon, caffeine, and 1,2,3-trimethoxy-5-methyl-benzene. Through principal component analysis (PCA), clustering analysis (CA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA), three different kinds of Pu-erh teas were classified successfully. Additionally, aged Pu-erh teas showed similar volatile constituents as ripe teas. This study suggested that HS-SPME/GC-MS combined with chemometrics methods is accurate, sensitive, fast, universal and ideal for rapid routine analysis and discrimination of Pu-erh teas with different processing technologies and storage times. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,,20154401466939,,"Lv, Shidong (1, 2); Wu, Yuanshuang (1); Wei, Jifu (3); Lian, Ming (1); Wang, Chen (1); Gao, Xuemei (1); Meng, Qingxiong (1) ","(1) Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650500, China (2) Kunming Grain and Oil and Feed Product Quality Inspection Center, Kunming, Yunnan; 650118, China (3) Research Division of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing; 210029, China ",RSCACL,"722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 913.4 Manufacturing - 921 Mathematics - 922 Statistical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics",,,,,Alcohols - Caffeine - Digital storage - Gas chromatography - Hydraulic structures - Mass spectrometry - Multivariant analysis - Palmitic acid - Phase space methods - Processing - Saturated fatty acids - Volatile organic compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Meng, Qingxiong(qxmeng@scbg.ac.cn) ",10.1039/c5ra15381f,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,107,2015,English,Principal component analysis,,41.0,87806-87817,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,Application of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and chemometrics methods for assessing volatile profiles of Pu-erh tea with different processing methods and ageing years,,Chromatography-mass spectrometry - Discriminate analysis - Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry - Head-space solid-phase microextraction - Manufacturing methods - Multivariate statistical method - Orthogonal projection - Processing technologies,5,
Commun. Comput. Info. Sci.,"Scheduling the redundant nodes to sleep is an effective technology to sufficiently prolong the life circle of wireless sensor network on the premise of meeting the coverage quality. According to position distribution of the neighboring nodes, a node scheduling algorithm of wireless sensor network is proposed on the basis of the necessary condition that a node becomes a redundant one and whether the complementary neighboring nodes meet the circle cover. The new algorithm reduces the computational complexity. Simulation results show that the new algorithm is effective to schedule the redundant node to sleep for energy-saving. It predicates nearly 26 % nodes to sleep when the perception radius is 10 meters and coverage rate is unchanged.

Chem. Eng. Process.: Process Intensif.,"The microwave irradiation is used to roast zinc slag oxidation dust in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid with the aim of accelerating roasting process. The roasted material is leached with tap water for the recovery of zinc and indium. The influence of roasting temperature, particle size, and the ratio of acid to ZSOD mass on the rate of roasting reactions were investigated. The results show that the extraction rate of zinc and indium increases with increasing the roasting temperature and the ratio of acid to ZSOD mass, while decreases with increase in the particle size. The samples were characterized using XRD and SEM. Under the conditions employed in the present work a maximum recovery of 94% and 90% of zinc and indium could be achieved. Shrinking core model was used to describe the kinetic parameters and to identify the rate controlling step.

Biosens. Bioelectron.,"To develop a rapid and simple method for sensitive determination of artemisinin (ART) in complicated matrices, a novel electrochemical sensor was constructed by in-situ polymerization of ART-imprinted membranes (ART-MIMs) on the surface of graphene (G) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) using acrylamide (AM) as functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linking agent after the experimental parameters for the preparation of ART-MIMs such as functional monomer, molar ratio of template, monomer and cross-linking agent together with extraction condition were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the sensor named as ART-MIM/G/GCE exhibited a good selectivity, high sensitivity and considerably better resistance against some analogs of artemisinin such as dihydroartemisinin (DHA), artemether (ARM) and artesunate (ARTS). The calibration graph for the determination of artemisinin by the sensor was linear in the range of 1.0 × 10-8mol L-1to 4.0 × 10-5molL-1with the detection limit of 2.0 × 10-9mol L-1. Meanwhile, this sensor possessed of good regeneration, stability and practicability. It could retain more than 94% of its original response after used at least 80 times or stored in water at room temperature for 60 days. The obtained sensor was successfully applied to determine the contents of artemisinin in the extract of Artemisia annua L. with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 3.5% (n=5). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20144100083499,,"Bai, Huiping (1); Wang, Chunqiong (1); Chen, Jing (1); Peng, Jun (1); Cao, Qiue (1) ","(1) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Nature Resource, Ministry of Education, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",BBIOE4,704.1 Electric Components - 761 Nanotechnology - 801 Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.2 Polymerization,,,,,Acrylic monomers - Crosslinking - Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Glass membrane electrodes - Graphene - Polymerization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cao, Qiue ",10.1016/j.bios.2014.09.034,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734235,,,,09565663,,"February 15, 2015",English,Electrochemical sensors,,33.0,352-358,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Biosensors and Bioelectronics,,A novel sensitive electrochemical sensor based on in-situ polymerized molecularly imprinted membranes at graphene modified electrode for artemisinin determination,,Artemisinin - Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate - Experimental parameters - In-situ polymerization - Modified glassy carbon electrode - Molecular imprinted membrane - Molecularly imprinted membranes - Relative standard deviations,64,
"Proc. - IEEE Conf. Collab. Internet Comput., CIC","MapReduce is an attractive programming model for large-scale data-parallel applications. However, the original MapReduce framework also needs some optimizations to improve its performance. In this paper, we propose a novel bloom filter based lightweight MapReduce index (BF-MapReduce). Instead of scanning the whole dataset, our approach uses an auxiliary index to quickly skip unnecessary data segments, which can efficiently degrade the processing cost at map phase. Moreover, in order to deal with multi-dimension dataset, a converting schema is proposed. It can map multi-dimension data into one-dimension index. The experimental results show that our approach is efficient and lightweight. It can reduce the task running time dramatically with a little storage and maintenance cost. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161902347934,7423074.0,"Tan, Zi-Long (1); Zhou, Ke-Ren (1); Zhang, Hao (1); Zhou, Wei (1) ","(1) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,"703.2 Electric Filters - 722.1 Data Storage, Equipment and Techniques - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing",119874.0,"October 28, 2015 - October 30, 2015","Hangzhou, China","1st IEEE International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing, CIC 2015",Bandpass filters - Data structures - Distributed computer systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/CIC.2015.47,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781509000890.0,,,"March 1, 2016",English,Digital storage,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing, CIC 2015",10.0,125-129,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing, CIC 2015",AdTime Technology Ltd.; IEEE Computer Society; Shunwang Techology Group; Zhejiang University,BF-MapReduce: A Bloom Filter Based Efficient Lightweight Search,,Bloom filters - Distributed data storages - Large scale data - Maintenance cost - Map-reduce - Mapreduce frameworks - Processing costs - Programming models,,
Proc. Sci.,"Kepler K2 space telescope observations of cataclysmic variables (CVs) were used to search for periodic behavior and identify possible pseudo periods due to the satellite artefacts from periodic thrusters. Detailed period analyses were carried out for the dwarf nova UV Gem observed in the long cadence (LC) of the K2 campaign 0 (K2-C0) and seven CVs, comprised of four faint CVs and three known dwarf novae QZ Vir, RZ Leo and TW Vir observed in the long and short cadences (LC and SC) of the K2 campaign 1 (K2-C1), respectively. All 23 signals including harmonics and beat periods were identified from the periodograms of the four faint CVs in K2-C1. Among these 23 periods, there were eight signals distinctly detected from the periodogram of J1125-0016 due to a possible resonance between its orbital period and the common 5.9-hr satellite thruster period. A series of periodic dips with varying profiles obeying a period of 3.9256 day were found in all three SC light curves of K2-C1, which were extracted from the original K2 data files. This period is due to a periodic short-timescale resetting of the thruster. A two-dimensional power spectrum of the dwarf nova UV Gem observed in K2-C0 with a moving window of 4.7 day was derived for demonstrating the variations of the two significant modulations at the periods of 2.07 hr and 2.12 hr during the outburst and quiescent phases. In addition, the other two newly detected weak but consistent signals at the periods of 1.06hr and 0.91 hr were seen, likely due to the first harmonic of the 2.12 hr period and the fifth harmonic of the 6-hr thruster event of the satellite, respectively. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons.",,,20180504691198,28.0,"Dai, Zhibin (1, 5); Szkody, Paula (2); Garnavich, Peter M.

Appl. Catal. B Environ.,"A noble-metal-free photocatalytic system for highly efficient hydrogen production has been developed with colloidal nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs), CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) and lactic acid (LA) as catalyst, photosensitizer and sacrificial electron donor, respectively, in aqueous solution without any organic solvent. The hydrogen evolution activity of the highly active Ni NPs (6nm) could amount to 80% of the well-known Pt nanoparticles (5nm) in equimolar amount at pH 3.0 water solution under visible light (λ≥420nm) irradiation. A maximum turnover number (TON) of 9710 based on Ni NPs (6nm) was obtained after 10h of irradiation at a catalyst concentration of 1.38×10-5M and turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1232 was achieved for the first 6h of photocatalytic reaction. A series of Ni nanoparticles colloids with different sizes plus Fe, Co nanoparticles were also tested for photocatalytic H2-evolution. The results showed the obvious effect of Ni NPs size on the hydrogen evolution activity and the smaller (6nm) Ni nanoparticles exhibited the highest activity compared with other nanoparticles of 11nm and 20nm in size. This work demonstrates the size control of non-precious metal nanoparticles could effectively enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production, which provides an inexpensive means of developing efficient and low-cost photocatalytic systems for harnessing solar energy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20143118013890,,"Cao, Shuang (1); Wang, Chuan-Jun (1); Lv, Xiao-Jun (1); Chen, Yong (1); Fu, Wen-Fu (1, 2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Photochemical Conversion and Optoelectronic Materials, HKU-CAS Joint Laboratory on New Materials, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China (2) College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming 650092, China ",ACBEE3,522 Gas Fuels - 547.1 Precious Metals - 548.1 Nickel - 615.2 Solar Power - 657.1 Solar Energy and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Cadmium sulfide - Hydrogen production - II-VI semiconductors - Irradiation - Lactic acid - Light - Metal nanoparticles - Nanorods - Nickel - Photosensitizers - Precious metals - Solar energy - Solar power generation - Solutions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Y.(chenyong@mail.ipc.ac.cn) ",10.1016/j.apcatb.2014.07.014,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: CAAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Number: 2132057, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; Number: 2012DFH40090, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology; Number: 2013CB834804, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013CB632403, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21107117, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21371175, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21353002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 21273257, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was financially supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2013CB834804, 2013CB632403 ) and the Ministry of Science and Technology ( 2012DFH40090 ).

J. Mol. Struct.,"Abstract The reaction between HOCO+and H2O has been examined using ab initio theory to locate and optimize the critical points on the potential energy surfaces. The results show that there are several product channels. First, the ion H3O+, which has been observed in the interstellar medium, can be generated by direct abstraction of H from HOCO+. Second, the HOCO+cation can combine with a water molecule to generate the new molecule, HOC(OH)2+, for which stable structures have been found. Third, a transition state can exist where the reaction proceeds through HOC(O)OH2+radicals to produce the products HCOOH++ OH. We have also calculated structural parameters, energies, and vibrational frequencies of both the HOC(O)OH2+adduct and the products which are presented to help in their future identification. Using the calculated spectrums of the ground states and excited states we have proposed possible structures which correspond to observed spectral lines. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,20153301161680,21692.0,"Liu, Na (1, 2); Liu, Zhao (1); Liu, Ying (1); Qin, Shengli (3) ","(1) Department of Physics, Hebei Advanced Thin Film Laboratory, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang; Hebei; 050024, China (2) College of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Shijiazhuang University of Economics, Shijiazhuang; Hebei; 050031, China (3) Department of Physics Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; Yunnan; 650091, China ",JMOSB4,801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 921 Mathematics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics,,,,,Calculations - Ground state - Molecules - Potential energy surfaces - Quantum chemistry - Rate constants - Spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Ying ",10.1016/j.molstruc.2015.07.037,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 11104071, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2011CB606401, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: A2012205066, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province; Number: A2012205069, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province; Number: YQ2013008, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: U1331116, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11304076, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11274089, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11274089 , U1331116 , and 11304076 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (Grant Nos.

Opt. Lett.,"We demonstrate the polarization mode selection and the dependence of coupling efficiency on polarization state of pump light for an optofluidic ring resonator (OFRR) laser. An optical fiber is chosen to serve as the ring resonator and surrounded by rhodamine 6G dye solution of lower refractive index as the fluidic gain medium. When the ring resonator is pumped by a linearly s-polarized laser, the emitted whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing is of parallel polarization (TM mode), while p-polarized laser excitation generates a vertically polarized lasing emission (TE mode), both TM and TE mode lasing emission coexist simultaneously if the ring resonator is pumped by the s- and p-mixed polarized light. Further investigation reveals that the lasing intensity of the TM mode is approximately twice that of the TE mode for the same pump energy density, meaning an obvious difference of coupling efficiency on the polarization state of pump light; the experimental results of coupling efficiency are well explained by an induced dipole model. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,,20160701923890,,"Zhang, Yuanxian (1, 2); Meng, Weidong (1); Yang, Hongyue (1); Chu, Yufei (1); Pu, Xiaoyun (1) ","(1) Department of Physics, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Key Laboratory for Micro/nano Materials and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",OPLEDP,"714.3 Waveguides - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 744.1 Lasers, General - 744.9 Laser Applications - 943.2 Mechanical Variables Measurements",,,,,Angle measurement - Laser excitation - Optical fibers - Optical resonators - Polarization - Pumping (laser) - Refractive index,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Pu, Xiaoyun(xypu@163.com) ",10.1364/OL.40.005101,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15394794,,,,01469592,21,"November 1, 2015",English,Whispering gallery modes,,16.0,5101-5104,,2015,OSA - The Optical Society,Optics Letters,,Demonstration of polarization mode selection and coupling efficiency of optofluidic ring resonator lasers,,Coupling efficiency - Induced dipoles - Lasing emissions - Opto-fluidic ring resonator - Parallel polarization - Polarization modes - Polarization state - Whispering-gallery-mode lasing,40,
"Int. Conf. Electron. Packag. Technol., ICEPT","The process of solder paste dispensing is considered as a popular coating method in solder paste applications currently. The properties of dispensing solder paste are easily effected by the changes of proportions. The research of Sn-Ag-Cu lead-free dispensing solder paste mainly focuses on the ratios of Sn-Ag-Cu alloy powder and flux, and the ratios of components in flux. In this paper, the mass ratio of alloy powder and flux in dispensing solder paste was 86:14wt %. On the basis of multiingredient in flux, the study had adopted four-factor and threelevel of L9 (34) orthogonal designing method to design the mass percent of four main ingredients in flux, and achieved a set of optimizing parameters quickly. The four selected factors were rosin, thixotropic agent, solvent, and surfactant. Their effects on viscosity were investigated in this study. With formula of the flux optimized by orthogonal designs and range analysis, investigations on property of the dispensing solder paste had been made. The experiments of viscosity, spreading and slump showed that the methods were effective and feasible to form parameter optimization of dispensing solder paste.

Nanoscale,"Coordination nanoparticles (CNPs) are becoming attractive platforms for chemical sensing applications because their unique adjustable properties offer the opportunity to design various luminescent nanoprobes. Here, we present a CNP-based fluorescent nanoprobe, in which fluorophores (rhodamine B, RB) and quenchers (methylene blue, MB) were spontaneously enfolded by coordination networks self-assembled of adenine, biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (BDA) and zinc ions. The aggregation of fluorophores and quenchers in CNPs resulted in a quenched state fluorescence of RB. RB and MB could be released from CNPs in the presence of phosphate, which triggered the fluorescence of RB. On the basis of recognition-driven disassembly principle, a novel turn-on fluorescent probe for the determination of PO43-with a wide response range (0.5-50 μM) has been successfully applied in the detection of phosphate in human serum samples.

Zhenkong Kexue yu Jishu Xuebao,"We theoretically addressed the mechanisms responsible for the carbothermic-chlorination of aluminum sub-oxide in vacuum. First, the influence of the reaction conditions, including but not limited to the reaction temperature and reaction pressure, was mathematically modeled and analytically calculated in thermodynamics to optimize the reaction conditions. Next, the first principle calculation by the plane-wave pseudo-potential scheme, based on density function theory (DFT), was performed to evaluate the stable molecular structures of Al2O and C, AlCl3 and C, Al2O and AlCl3 with C, respectively. Finally, the reaction, at 1760 K and 60 Pa, was simulated in ab initio molecular dynamics calculation. The simulated results show that the gaseous Al2O is decomposed more easily than A1C13 gas on C(001), and that most A1C1, decomposed from AlCl3, are adsorbed on C(001). We suggest that the calculated results may be of some basic and technological interest. ©, 2015, Science Press.

The EC50values of E. pisciphila ACCC32496 to Cd were 332.2 mg L-1after 30 days on solid medium and 111.2 mg L-1after 7 days in liquid medium. Cd stress markedly stimulated the production of superoxide anion, H2O2and malondialdehyde in the fungal mycelia. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase reached their maxima at 100 mg L-1Cd. The glutathione and non-protein thiol contents, along with the total antioxidant capability, reached their maxima at 50 mg L-1Cd.

Phys E,"Highly ordered mesoporous material MCM-41 was synthesized from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as Si source and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as template. Well-dispersed NiO nanoparticles were introduced into the highly ordered mesoporous MCM-41 by chemical precipitation method to prepare the highly ordered mesoporous NiO/MCM-41 composite. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement were used to examine the morphology and the microstructure of the obtained composite. The morphological study clearly revealed that the synthesized NiO/MCM-41 composite has a highly ordered mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 435.9 m2g-1. A possible formation mechanism is preliminary proposed for the formation of the nanostructure. The adsorption performance of NiO/MCM-41 composite as an adsorbent was further demonstrated in the removal azo dyes of methyl orange (MO), Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB) and rhodaming B (RB) under visible light irradiation and dark, respectively. The kinetics and mechanism of removal methylene blue were studied. The results show that NiO/MCM-41 composite has a good removal capacity for organic pollutant MB from the wastewater under the room temperature. Compared with MCM-41 and NiO nanoparticles, 54.2% and 100% higher removal rate were obtained by the NiO/MCM-41 composite. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20143618142919,,"Xiao, Xuechun (1); Zhang, Fei (1); Feng, Zhipeng (1); Deng, Shaojuan (1); Wang, Yude (1) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, 650091 Kunming, China ",PELNFM,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Adsorption - Aromatic compounds - Azo dyes - Dyes - Gas adsorption - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Nanoparticles - Nickel oxide - Organic pollutants - Precipitation (chemical) - Silicon compounds - Solutions - Stripping (dyes) - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Y.(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.physe.2014.08.006,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: ZD2013006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Excellent Young Talents Fund Program of Higher Education Institutions of Anhui Province; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 2011FA001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology of Yunnan Province via the Key Project for the Science and Technology (Grant no. 2011FA001 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51262029 ), and the Key Project of the Department of Education of Yunnan Province ( ZD2013006 ), and Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University .",,13869477,,January 2015,English,Mesoporous materials,,51.0,4-12,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Physica E: Low-Dimensional Systems and Nanostructures,,Adsorptive removal and kinetics of methylene blue from aqueous solution using NiO/MCM-41 composite,,Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide - Chemical precipitation method - Mesoporous structures - Methylene Blue - Nitrogen adsorption desorption - Ordered mesoporous materials - Ordered mesoporous structures - Removal performance,65,

This paper proposes the coordinate exploitation of high and low-grade ore simultaneously by analyzing raw ore grade and production parameters. Considering the integration of mining engineering and mineral processing, quantitatively responds that coordinate exploitation is feasible but necessary, and the mining feasibility is mainly affected by deposit thickness and raw ore grade. Coordinate exploitation of NPV optimization model has been constructed theoretically by considering the time value of capital, and the case closely related to this model is unfolded. The NPV function is mainly affected by the minimum mining grade, proportion of high and low grade ore production, recovery rate and mine life. This model can be effectively used to determine the optimal mining grade so as to realize the integrated optimization of mining decision-making and mineral processing. Conclusions would be promoted to similar deposit exploitation in middle-low grade phosphate rock. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20162402496139,,"Shang, De Lei (1); Yin, Guang Zhi (2); Li, Yao Ji (3, 4); Li, Xiao Shuang (3, 4); Wang, Meng Lai (3, 4) ","(1) College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Disaster Dynamics and Control, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China (3) Engineering Research Center of Phosphate Resources Development and Utilization, Kunming, China (4) Yunnan Phosphate Chemical Group Co.

J Am Ceram Soc,"Rare-earth ion-doped semiconducting phosphor has attracted extensive attention due to the ability to achieve efficient luminescence through the host sensitization. Here, we present a new type red-emitting Eu3+-doped BiOCl phosphors possessing a broad excitation band in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) region. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations confirm that Eu3+ion dopants result in forming impurity energy level near valence band, and the excellent broadband NUV-exciting ability of Eu3+ion is due to the electronic transitions of BiOCl band gap. Moreover, the highest emission intensity of the phosphors is from the5D0→7F4transition of Eu3+around 699 nm (far-red) through whether host excitation or direct Eu3+ions excitation, which lie in the particular structure of BiOCl crystals.

The existing fault mechanism models cannot describe the double impact phenomenon of a faulty ball bearing. To address this problem, an approach by combining the time-varying displacement excitation and the time-varying contact force excitation is employed to establish a reasonable dynamic model, which explicitly reveals the contact process of rolling element and outer race on the defected zone. The coupled solution of dynamic equations is obtained by using Runge-Kutta method.

Process Biochem.,"The tubers of Bletilla striata were fermented with Fusarium avenaceum and Fusarium oxysporum. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) and antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the extracts from the fermented products were measured. Additionally, the extracts of both F. avenaceum and F. oxysporum fermented B. striata (FBS) were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results showed that the F. avenaceum and F. oxysporum FBSs possessed higher TPCs and exhibited stronger antioxidant and antibacterial activities (Bacillus subtilis) in comparison with original material not co-fermented with microorganisms. Chemical characterization of the two extracts with UV-vis, FT-IR, and1H NMR implied that some of the phenolic glycosides may be deglycosylated and that bibenzyl compounds and saccharides may be metabolized in both FBS systems. Microbial fermentation enhances the TPC as well as the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of B. striata.

The effects of fog-haze on the insulators represent in two aspects: a) increasing contamination on the surface of insulators and b) increasing the leakage current and decreasing the flashover voltage of insulators due to the wet deposition. Therefore, in this paper, naturally polluted insulators under fog-haze were taken as test objects, and the contamination and AC pollution flashover characteristics of different kinds of insulators were studied. According to the test results, contamination on the insulator surface is increased significantly under fog-haze in a short time. Compared with porcelain and glass insulator, the composite insulator shows more serious contamination under fog-haze environment. Saturated moisture time of two-shed type porcelain insulator is the shortest and saturated moisture leakage current of that is the largest, while composite insulator has the longest saturated moisture time and the smallest saturated moisture leakage current. Composite insulator is with the largest flashover voltage gradient, which is followed by bell type porcelain insulator and deep under-rib type glass insulator, and that of two-shed type porcelain insulator is the smallest among these insulators. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161302147333,7295342.0,"Sun, Youfei (1); Tu, Youping (1); Wang, Cong (1); Wang, Shaohe (1); Cheng, Yangchun (1); Peng, Qingjun (2); Chen, Xianfu (2) ","(1) Beijing Key Laboratory of High Voltage and Electromagnetic Compatibility, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China (2) Postdoctoral Workstation of Yunnan Power Grid Corporation, Kunming, China ",PPAMF7,413 Insulating Materials - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.1 Dielectric Materials - 812.1 Ceramics - 812.3 Glass,117583.0,"July 19, 2015 - July 22, 2015","Sydney, NSW, Australia","11th IEEE International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials, ICPADM 2015",Contamination - Dielectric materials - Electric insulators - Flashover - Fog - Glass - Insulating materials - Leakage currents - Moisture - Pollution - Porcelain,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICPADM.2015.7295342,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479989034.0,,,"October 8, 2015",English,Insulator contamination,ICPADM 2015 - 2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials,14.0,596-599,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials,Macey's Electrical Pty.

TMS Annu Meet,"The clean utilization of the residue containing chloride, CuCl residue, produced from zinc hydrometallurgy is very important for the recycle of valuable metals. And drying is the main process in recycling. In this study, response surface methodology was used to optimize operating conditions of the drying of CuCl residue in a convection oven and desirability function used as the methodology for the optimization. Optimization factors were air temperature (80 100°C), material thickness (10-25mm) and process time (80-120min) while investigated responses was final moisture content. The optimum conditions were found to be the temperature of 95.48°C with the material thickness of 13.47mm for the process time of 89.48 min. Under optimum conditions, the predicted moisture content of CuCl residue was 4.11% while the experimental date was 4.13%.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","A new gas sensor with high response and selectivity was fabricated by using molecularly imprinted powders (MIPs) which provide special recognition sites to methanol. The MIPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The gas sensing properties of MIPs to methanol were investigated. The experimental results indicate that the sensors based on the MIPs show excellent gas sensing properties to methanol vapor, and the properties of the sensor with x = 1:4 (x = methanol:methyl acrylic acid, molar ratio) are the best. At the optimal operating temperature of 130 °C, the response of the sensor (x = 1:4) to 1 ppm methanol is 41, and the response and recovery times are 40 s and 50 s, respectively. Those good gas sensing properties make the MIPs the promising candidates for determining methanol vapor in air. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20144600202567,,"Zhu, Q. (1, 2); Zhang, Y.M. (1, 2); Zhang, J.

Environ. Earth Sci.,"Leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry might reflect the biogeochemical features of ecosystems, yet the potential range of stoichiometric flexibility under geochemically P-enriched soils (GPES) is still unclear. Leaf N and P of 126 plant species in 70 vegetation plots in GPES were investigated in central Yunnan, southwestern China, and leaf P fractions (i.e., inorganic vs. organic P) of the dominant species were examined. Our objectives were to improve the understanding of the role of soil N and P variability in controlling leaf N and P stoichiometry of plant communities in GPES. We found that plants in GPES had higher mean leaf P (4.07 mg/g) and lower N:P ratios (4.94) than average plant values that have been recorded in other parts of the world so far. Some fast-growing plants had extremely high leaf P (>10 mg/g). Community leaf N and P contents increased as soil N availability increased, but soil N variability was unrelated to community leaf N:P. Instead, community leaf P and N:P ratios were primarily determined by soil P; as soil P availability increased, leaf P increased and leaf N:P significantly decreased. Greater accumulation of inorganic P relative to organic P in leaf was the direct driving factor for community leaf P and N:P ratio patterns in GPES. Although soil P availability was the main controlling factor of leaf N:P patterns, community composition could be manipulated to restore the balance of N and P stoichiometry based on the different responses across species and plant types. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20152100881040,,"Yan, Kai (1); Duan, Changqun (1); Fu, Denggao (1); Li, Jie (1, 2); Wong, Michelle H.

Mod. Food Sci. Technol.,"To determine a method for improving the aroma quality and strengthening the undertone, and to explore the possibility of using glycosidic flavor precursors as raw materials in thermo-flavoring, a natural identical flavor precursor in monoterpenol glycosidically bound form was synthesized and the corresponding properties were studied. For stereoselective synthesis, rhodinol with typical pure-sweet and floral notes was chosen as the main raw material to carry out the glycosylation reaction with tetra-O-acetate-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide. Rhodinol-β-D-glucoside pentaacetate was obtained by using the modified Koenigs-Knorr reaction, and the deacetylation reaction in alkaline conditions was conducted to yield a flavor precursor with a rhodinol-β-D-glucosidic linkage. The target product was obtained after the crude products were separated and purified by preparative liquid chromatography, and its natural identical structure was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Finally, the content was determined to be 99.46% by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results provide important data for the stereoselective synthesis of flavor precursors with a monoterpenol-β-D-glucopyranosidic linkage as well as a method to prepare flavoring raw materials for the study of properties of glycosidic flavor precursors and their application in high-temperature-resistant foods. © 2015, South China University of Technology.

J. Taiwan Inst. Chem. Eng.,"Oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) fibres were pretreated by ball milling (BM) at different durations of times. The pretreated fibres were characterised by wide angle X-ray diffraction analysis, particle-size distribution and scanning electron microscopy while the effectiveness of the pretreatment was correlated with the yield of acid hydrolysis to produce levulinic acid (LA). The obtained results showed that the highest yield of LA (10.4g/L, 52.08%) can be achieved from the 12h BM pretreated EFB fibres. Further BM pretreatment exceeding 12h has no significant effect on the LA yield. Optimisation process was further carried out by applying central composite with rotatable design to verify the optimum parameter (H2SO4concentration, temperature, and time) to produce LA. The optimal conditions for the LA production from the EFB fibres were 0.57N H2SO4, 185.98°C, and 195.77min for producing 10.77g/L (53.93 %) of LA. © 2015 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.",,,20150800544324,,"Chin, Siew Xian (1, 2); Chia, Chin Hua (1); Zakaria, Sarani (1); Fang, Zhen (2); Ahmad, Sahrim (1) ","(1) School of Applied Physics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor; 43600, Malaysia (2) Chinese Academy of Sciences, Biomass Group, Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resource and Sustainable Use, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, 88 Xuefulu, Kunming, Yunnan Province; 650223, China ",,604.2 Machining Operations - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Fibers - Fruits - Hydrolysis - Milling (machining) - Organic acids - Palm oil - Particle size - Particle size analysis - Scanning electron microscopy - X ray diffraction analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chia, Chin Hua(chiachinhua@yahoo.com) ",10.1016/j.jtice.2015.01.028,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: FRGS/2/2013/SG01/UKM/02/2, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education; Number: 2014-DIP-013, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education; Number: ERGS-1-2012-STG01/UKM/03/3, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Ministry of Education; Number: -, Acronym: UKM, Sponsor: Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; ","The authors acknowledge Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and the Ministry of Education for the financial support via the research project grants FRGS/2/2013/SG01/UKM/02/2 , ERGS-1-2012-STG01/UKM/03/3 , and 2014-DIP-013 .",,18761070,,"July 1, 2015",English,Ball milling,,37.0,85-92,,2015,Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers,Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers,,Ball milling pretreatment and diluted acid hydrolysis of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) fibres for the production of levulinic acid,,Central composite - Green chemicals - Levulinic acid - Oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) - Optimal conditions - Optimisations - Optimum parameters - Wide angle Xray diffraction,52,
Astropart. Phys.,"Spherical design and Davies-cotton design, which can supply a wide Field of View (FOV) and have a single optical element structure, are the two candidate optics for Wide FOV Cherenkov/Fluorescence Telescope Array (WFCTA). To obtain a good imaging quality, we have done a detailed study to acquire optimal configurations for these two optics. In this paper, first, a proper curvature radius for the reflector, an optimized location for the camera, as well as a tolerance for the distortion of images for two designs have been presented. Furthermore, using such optimal configurations, the features of Cherenkov images initiated by proton and iron showers both with two optics have been investigated. Based on these results, it can be concluded that spherical design has the prior optical properties, such as a wider FOV of 16°, a higher and more homogeneous resolution for all incident directions within the 16° FOV and a lower light loss in the spots, as well as more signals collected in an Cherenkov image, relatively shorter arrival time difference for lights in a shower and brighter PMTs in the central part of a shower track. Thus it will be chosen as WFCTA optics. Finally, the optical properties of the two designs with 10° FOV have also been investigated. It should be mentioned that with such a smaller FOV, Davies-cotton optics is an effective design for it has a great imaging quality comparing with the setup of 16° FOV. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This configuration in symmetry is preserved in metal particles for a large intensity applied field, owing to the abundance in electrons. In extrinsic semiconductor particles, this symmetry is not maintained when the applied field approaches high intensity (∼104 V/cm for a dopant concentration of 1017cm-3) as a result of depletion of mobile charge carriers (electrons or holes) in one of the hemispheres.

Thus, the Web service composition which consists of these services will be necessarily random of the QoS. The requirements of the QoS of Web service composition may not be certainly satisfied. We use a simulation approach named Importance Sampling to analyze the QoS probability of Web service composition in stochastic PERT network. In this paper, we propose a relatively simple distribution function and introduce a weighting function to ensure that the estimating of the target distribution function is an unbiased estimation. We conduct a comparison of Importance Sampling technique with Monte Carlo simulation about the rationality and the operation efficiency based on the actual QoS data of Web services by experiment.

In this work, we report CNMS as a stationary phase for high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation of positional isomers. High-resolution separation of aminophenol, dihydroxybenzene, nitroaniline, nitrophenol, chloroaniline, bromoaniline, iodoaniline, dinitrobenzene, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobromobenzene isomers on CNMS columns was performed. Slurry-packed CNMS columns had better selectivity than commercial β-cyclodextrin HPLC columns for separating these positional isomers. The effects of mobile phase composition, injected analyte mass and column temperature on separation were investigated. The relative standard deviations for five replicate separations of positional isomers were 0.10-0.43% for the retention time and 0.5-3.9% for the peak area. Therefore, CNMS columns are promising for separating positional isomers based on their good reproducibility, high resolution and excellent selectivity. In addition, the column also exhibits recognition ability toward racemates.

"Proc. - Int. Conf. Comput. Intell. Secur., CIS","Biometric-based signature is an emerging cryptographic primitive that allows a user with a biometric identity to produce a signature that can be verified successfully using another biometric identity if both biometric identities are within a predefined distance metric. Fuzzy identity-based signature is of particular value for biometric authentication, where biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, iris and voice are used in human identification. Unfortunately, constructions of fuzzy identity-based signature scheme so far are based on bilinear pairings that need costly operations. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy identity-based signature scheme that does not depend on bilinear pairings. With both the running time and the size of the signature being saved greatly, our scheme is more practical than the previous related schemes for practical application. The proposed fuzzy identity-based signature scheme is proved to be existential unforgeability against adaptively chosen message attack under the standard discrete logarithm assumption in the selective-set model. © 2014 IEEE.",,,20150800546598,7016934,"Wang, Changji (1) ","(1) National Pilot School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",,"461 Bioengineering and Biology - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 723.5 Computer Applications",110202.0,"November 15, 2014 - November 16, 2014","Kunming, Yunnan, China","10th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security, CIS 2014",Authentication - Biometrics - Public key cryptography,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Changji(wchangji@gmail.com) ",10.1109/CIS.2014.101,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479974344.0,,,"January 20, 2015",English,Electronic document identification systems,,18.0,440-444,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2014 10th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security, CIS 2014",Aviation Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Airborne and Missileborne Computer; Beijing Normal University; Guangdong University of Technology; IEEE CPS; Shenzhen University; Xidian University,An efficient fuzzy identity-based signature scheme without bilinear pairings,,Biometric authentication - Chosen message attacks - Cryptographic primitives - Discrete logarithm assumptions - Fuzzy identities - Identity based signature - SET modeling - Without bilinear pairings,,

Huanan Ligong Daxue Xuebao,"Proposed in this paper is a method of utilizing a capacitive transducer to harvest the electric potential energy stored in the space around the AC transmission line, which helps to supply power to the on-line -monitoring system installed on a transmission tower. First, the circuit model of the potential energy-harvesting system and the relationship between the load resistance and the output power are analyzed, and a way to harvesting the maximum energy is presented. Then, the electric field distribution at the tower head of a 500 kV AC double-loop transmission line is simulated, and the places suitable for transducer installation are determined. Finally, an experiment is conducted by adopting a capacitive transducer with a radius of 40 cm and an interval of 15 cm, and about 5 mJ of energy is obtained at 50 kV in 24 s, which means that the capacitive transducer can afford an output power of 208 μW to meet the minimum power limit of wireless sensor nodes. In practically application, there is higher operating voltage compared with the experiment, by utilizing the high-intensity electric field efficiently on the tower with optimized capacitive transducer, enough energy will be harvested to power the on-line-monitoring system. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology.

IET Conf Publ,"For the surface water body extraction from China GF-1 satellite multi-spectral images, this paper proposes a algorithm based on the LBV transformation analysis method. The LBV transformed images can be used more effectively for the analysis of ground features than the original multispectral satellite images. So in the proposed method, the LBV transformation equations for GF-1 images are firstly discussed. Then, by analyzing gray level curves of six typical ground features in L(the general radiance level), B(the visible-infrared radiation) and V(the band radiance variation vector) images respectively, a decision criterion for extracting water body is obtain.

"Chinese Control Conf., CCC","Secure communication is one of the most promising application of chaos theory. As chaotic signals were noise-like, unpredictable, using chaotic systems to design secure communication system is feasible and reliable. In this paper, we form an array with different kinds of chaotic system, and discuss the control method of the chaotic system array. A secure communication scheme based on the chaotic systems array is proposed. The masking signal of the new scheme is generated though processing the chaotic system array output signals with mathematical operations, signal process method or encryption algorithms. The types of chaotic system that formed chaotic system array, the control method of the array and the algorithms used for signal process can secondarily encrypt the secure communication system, which can make it work on a safer statue. The simulation results of basic secure communication cases which were built with Lorenz system and Chuas circuit show secure communication system constructed with chaotic system array works on a high security statue. The secure communication system built with chaotic system array is flexible, reliable, and achievable. When the secure communication system based on chaotic system array is constructed with FPGA, DSP and other ICs, it's worth a further study of the application of this system in engineering. © 2015 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.",,,20154601539167,7259672,"Li, Jinlong (1); Yang, Lun (2); Li, Jiagen (3); He, Mengju (1); Zhang, Qiang (1); Ye, Mengjiao (4) ","(1) TBEA Southweast Electrical Engineering Co.

Mater. Sci. Forum,"The sub-rapidly solidified Au-20Sn eutectic alloys were prepared by four different solidification pathways, such as, graphite mold conventional casting, graphite mold injection casting, copper mold injection casting, and water-cooled copper mold suction casting. The precipitating sequences of competing primary phases of sub-rapidly solidified Au-20Sn alloys with four different cooling rates were investigated. The results show that phase selection process is related to the cooling rates during sub-rapid solidification process. The primary ζ'-Au5Sn phase with developed dendrites precipitate at low cooling rate (2.4×10−4.2×102K/min) and the morphologies of the primary ζ'-Au5Sn change to rosette-like at higher cooling rate (9.0×103K/min). While the cooling rate reaches to 3.5×104K/min, the primary ζ'-Au5Sn phase can be suppressed but δ-AuSn phase will precipitate prior to the ζ'-Au5Sn phase. On the basis of the classical nucleation theory and transient nucleation theory, the process of competitive nucleation between the ζ'-Au5Sn phase and the δ-AuSn phase were analyzed for sub-rapid solidified Au-20Sn alloy. The theoretical calculations are consistent with the experimental investigations. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",,,20151700772551,,"Qu, Yu Hai (1); Yang, Kai Jin (1); Zhou, Yan Tian (2); Mao, Yong (1); Zhang, Wei (1); Xu, Si Yong (1) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Wafangdian Bearing Group Corp, Liaoning; 116300, China ",MSFOEP,"546.2 Tin and Alloys - 547.1 Precious Metals - 612.1 Internal Combustion Engines, General - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth",117499.0,"July 4, 2014 - July 7, 2014","Chengdu, China","Chinese Materials Congress, CMC 2014",Binary alloys - Cooling - Gold alloys - Graphite - Molds - Nucleation - Rapid solidification - Water injection,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Mao, Yong(maoyong@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.817.325,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783038353966.0,02555476,,2015,English,Tin alloys,,11.0,325-330,1 of 1,2015,Trans Tech Publications Ltd,Materials Science Forum,,Phase selection in sub-rapidly solidified Au-20Sn alloys,,Classical nucleation theory - Conventional casting - Experimental investigations - Phase selection - Sn alloys - Sub-rapid solidification - Theoretical calculations - Transient nucleation,817,Basic Research of Materials

Int. J. Miner. Process.,"The optimum conditions for the extraction of palladium and rhodium from spent automobile catalysts by microwave roasting were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). A central composite design (CCD) was used to investigate the effects of three independent variables (namely proportion (m/m, reagent/material), roasting temperature (°C) and holding time (min)) on the leaching rate of palladium and rhodium. The independent variables were coded at three levels and their actual values based on experimental results. The CCD consisted of 20 experimental points and six replications at the center point. Data were analyzed using design expert and statistical analysis system software. A second-order polynomial model was used for predicting the response. The model explained 53% more variation. Canonical analysis of surface responses shows that the stationary surface was a saddle. The optimal conditions for the leaching rate of palladium and rhodium obtained using ridge analysis were 9.75, 550°C, 60 min; 9.00, 540°C, 50 min; and 9.96, 550°C, 53.84 min, respectively. The predicted leaching rate of palladium is more than 99.29% and the predicted leaching rate of rhodium is more than 95.34% under three optimum conditions. In order to obtain the highest leaching rate, the conditions for the extraction of palladium and rhodium were tuned to 10, 550°C, 60 min. The actual leaching rates of palladium and rhodium were 99.33% and 95.48% at the tuned conditions, which are very similar to those predicted by RSM models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TMS Annu Meet,"Most Zn hydrometallurgy factories adopt Cu2SO4as a dechlorination reagent from zinc solution recently, thus much CuCl residue was produced. The present process of treating this residue is washing CuCl residue with water or sodium carbonate solution, which would bring a lot of trouble for water treatment and waste discharge. In this study, a method of roasting the residue with microwave energy is adopted for not only dechlorination of the CuCl residue and also recycle Cl therein as HCl. The pilot-scale equipment system includes a 20 KW microwave roasting equipment, a dust collection and a tail gas adsorption system. The experiments result shown that under following parameters of microwave roasting: 108 Kg CuCl residue with a grain size of -60 mesh, stirring speed at 10 r/min, roasting at 350°C for 4 h, the dechlorination rate is as high as 78.54 %, and a product of CuO with a Cl concentration of less than 3.7% can be obtained. What's more, the tail gas was analyzed as air and HCl, which can be absorbed as byproduct of hydrochloride. The power consumption for treating such CuCl residue with microwave energy is only about 488.88kW · h/t. © Copyright 2015 by The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.

Neiranji Gongcheng,"The study on the effects of biodiesel and atmospheric pressure on the performance and emission characteristics of compression ignition (CI) engine was conducted on engine test bench of plateau atmospheric simulation. The results show that the maximum torque and effective thermal efficiency of naturally aspirated diesel engine reduce remarkably when atmospheric pressure decreases, and the maximum torque rises first and then declines with the increase of biodiesel blending ratio. However, the maximum torque of turbocharged diesel engine decreases linearly when biodiesel blending ratio reduces. For naturally aspirated diesel, with the decrease of atmospheric pressure, the smoke of B100 (pure biodiesel) at mid and high speed with full load is significantly reduced as compared with that of B0 (pure diesel). For turbocharged diesel engine, reduction of the opacity of B100 under full throttle condition weakens with the increase of engine speed when compared with the opacity of B0, which is contrary to that of naturally aspirated diesel. For common-rail diesel engine, when compared with B0, the power output and actual fuel consumption of B100 are comparable at low speed with full load and its effective thermal efficiency is higher. With the increase of engine speed, the power output of B100 under full throttle condition reduces gradually, and actual fuel consumption increases when compared with B0; meanwhile, the effective thermal efficiency of B100 approaches to that of B0 gradually. Differences of the three biodiesels in physical and chemical characteristics have a little effect on the performance of common-rail diesel engine. Different biodiesels have similar combustion characteristics and NOx emissions under the same power or same torque conditions. However, waste cooking oil has the highest level of smoke, and followed by rubber seed and jatropha. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Internal Combustion Engines.

Our study demonstrates that the presence of Co2P even in a small amount can significantly accelerate the electrolyte decomposition at high voltage in the charge process for LiCoPO4due to the catalytic property of Co2P. Such a catalytic effect of Co2P can account for the abnormal increase of electrolyte decomposition observed for bigger LiCoPO4crystals.

Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Wireless body area network (WBAN) technology has attracted intensive attention from the academic and industrial research communities in recent years. For widespread deployment of WBANs, security and privacy must be addressed properly. In this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive named key-policy attribute-based ring signcryption (KP-ABRSC) scheme, which is a combination of identity-based ring signature scheme and key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme. In KP-ABRSC, each signcrypted message is labeled by the sender with a set of descriptive attributes and a list of identities of potential senders, while an access structure is embedded in each user’s private key by a trusted authority. We give formal syntax and security definitions for KP-ABRSC scheme and construct a KP-ABRSC scheme from bilinear pairings. The proposed KP-ABRSC scheme is proven to be indistinguishable against adaptive chosen plaintext attacks under the DBDH assumption and existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message and identity attacks under the CDH assumption. Finally, we present a cloud-based healthcare framework by exploiting our proposed KP-ABRSC scheme and WBANs, which can ensure data authenticity, confidentiality and non-repudiation, but also can offer participants privacy and fine-grained access control on encrypted medical data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,20160101746729,,"Wang, Changji (1, 2); Liu, Jing (1) ","(1) School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou; 510275, China ",,"714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 901.3 Engineering Research",157199.0,"November 18, 2015 - November 20, 2015","Zhangjiajie, China","15th International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing, ICA3PP 2015",Authentication - Chip scale packages - Industrial research - Network architecture - Parallel architectures - Public key cryptography,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Changji(wchangji@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-27161-3_47,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319271606.0,03029743,,2015,English,Wireless local area networks (WLAN),"Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing - ICA3PP International Workshops and Symposiums, Proceedings",11.0,521-530,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),School of Information Science and Engineering at Central South; School of Software at Central South University; Springer; University,Attribute-Based ring signcryption scheme and its application in wireless body area networks,,Attribute-based - Attribute-based encryptions - Identity-based ring signatures - Signcryption - Wireless body area network,9532,
Opt. Express,"In this paper, a cylindrical graphene plasmon waveguide (CGPW), which consists of two rolled graphene ribbons, a dielectric core and a dielectric interlayer is proposed, and its use for molecular sensing is investigated. First, an analytical model for the surface plasmon modes supported by this graphene geometry is presented and verified by finite element method simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a large tunability of the modes behavior by varying the Fermi level of the graphene, the coupling distance between the two sheets and the radius of the cylinder. Finally, a molecular sensing scheme based on the CGPW is proposed. Broadband spectroscopy of ethanol and toluene thin layers is realized by recording the changes in spectral intensity of the propagating mode. Due to the broadband localization capability of graphene plasmon mode which leads to a strong light-matter interaction in the midinfrared and terahertz regime, the proposed sensing scheme may provide an effective way for detecting nanometric-size molecules. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,,20161002056327,,"Yang, Jianfeng (1); Yang, Jingjing (1); Deng, Wei (1); Mao, Fuchun (1); Huang, Ming (1) ","(1) Wireless Innovation Lab. of Yunnan University, School of Information Science and Engineering, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",,761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Graphene - Surface plasmons,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1364/OE.23.032289,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10944087,"Number: 11564044, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013M531989, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2014T70890, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 61161007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61261002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61461052, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61161007, 61261002, 61461052, 11564044), the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (Grant No. 20135301110003, 20125301120009), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2013M531989, 2014T70890), and the Key Program of Natural Science of Yunnan Province (Grant Nos. 2013FA006, 2015FA015).",,,25,"December 14, 2015",English,Finite element method,,35.0,32289-32299,,2015,OSA - The Optical Society,Optics Express,,Transmission properties and molecular sensing application of CGPW,,Broad-band spectroscopy - Dielectric interlayers - Finite element method simulation - Light-matter interactions - Molecular sensing - Spectral intensity - Surface plasmon modes - Transmission property,23,
Acta Tabacaria Sin.,"Coding DNA sequence of one new gene NtGGPPSL (813 bp) was successfully obtained from cDNA of Nicotiana tabacum with the method of homology cloning. Blast results showed that the gene was 99%, 91% and 82% homologous to Nicotiana sylvestris, Nicotiana tomentosiformis and Solanum lycopersicum GGPPS small subunit gene, respectively. But the protein sequence encoded by NtGGPPSL did not have the key motif (DDXXXXD) of GGPPS small subunit, which suggested that the function of NtGGPPSL might be different. In order to explore the function of NtGGPPSL, expression level of NtGGPPSL in different stages and organs was studied by real-time PCR. NtGGPPSL was depressed through virus induced gene silencing strategy in Nicotiana benthamiana and content of plastid pigments (neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, chlorophyll a/b and β-carotene) was detected. Results showed that expression level of NtGGPPSL in stems and roots was significantly higher than other organs such as leaf. After NtGGPPSL was suppressed, Nicotiana benthamiana leaves became albescent obviously and the content of plastid pigments was significantly decreased compared with controls, suggesting that NtGGPPSL was involved in the synthesis of chlorophyll.

RSC Adv.,"Although a few systems prepared by using biotemplates have been employed as mesoporous photocatalysts, the natural latex secreted by plants has not been used as a template to synthesize porous materials, let alone for the achievement of high photocatalytic activity under solar light. Herein, one of the most important biosynthesized polymers, natural rubber latex from the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis in Xishuangbanna was directly used as a structure-directing agent in synthesis of thermally stable mesostructured TiO2. The as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, XPS, N2adsorption/desorption, TEM and UV-vis DRS. The synthesized TiO2exhibited highly effective photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenol and rhodamine B under solar light.

Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants, arising from various environmental stresses, impair the thiol-contained proteins that are susceptible to irregular oxidative formation of disulfide bonds, which might be alleviated by a relatively specific modifier called protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). From our previous data of the transcriptome and digital gene expression of cold-hardened Jatropha curcas, a PDI gene was proposed to be cold-relevant. In this study, its full-length cDNA (JcPDI) was cloned, with the size of 1649 bp containing the entire open reading frame (ORF) of 1515 bp. This ORF encodes a polypeptide of 504 amino acids with theoretical molecular weight of 56.6 kDa and pI value of 4.85. One N-terminal signal peptide (−MASKGSIWSCMFLFSLI VAISAGEG-) and the C-terminal anchoring sequence motif (−KDEL-) specific to the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as two thioredoxin domains (−CGHC-), are also found by predictions. Through semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the expression of JcPDI was characterized to be tissue-differential strongly in leaves and roots, but weakly in stems, and of cold-induced alternations. Furthermore, JcPDI overexpression in yeast could notably enhance the cold resistance of host cells. Conclusively, these results explicitly suggested a considerable association of JcPDI to cold response and a putative application potential for its correlated genetic engineering. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20151400711101,,"Wang, Haibo (1, 2); Zou, Zhurong (1); Gong, Ming (1) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Sustainable Development and Utilization of Biomass Energy, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Biomass Energy and Environmental Biotechnology of Yunnan Province, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) College of Biological Resources and Environmental Science, Qujing Normal University, Qujing; Yunnan; 655011, China ",,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 822.3 Food Products,,,,,Cell membranes - Cloning - Covalent bonds - Encoding (symbols) - Gene expression - Proteins - Signal encoding - Sulfur compounds - Yeast,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gong, Ming(gongming6307@163.com) ",10.1007/s12010-015-1585-3,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15590291,,,,02732289,2,"May 27, 2015",English,Gene encoding,,21.0,428-439,,2015,Humana Press Inc.,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,,"Molecular Cloning, Expression Analysis, and Preliminarily Functional Characterization of the Gene Encoding Protein Disulfide Isomerase from Jatropha curcas",,Expression analysis - Jatropha curcas - Molecular cloning - Over-expression - Protein disulfide isomerases,176,

IEEE Trans Dielectr Electr Insul,"Moisture equilibrium curves are well accepted methods for moisture estimation of insulation paper in field transformers. The thermal aging effects on moisture partition diagrams of mineral oil-paper and a new aging-resistant mixed oil-paper insulation system were studied. The purpose was to assess the moisture content accurately, particularly in transformers used for long-term operations. Thermal aging experiment was conducted at 130 °C for 80 days, and moisture equilibrium curves at five different aging degrees and three different temperatures were constructed. Results showed that under the same oil moisture content, the moisture content in paper decreased as the aging condition aggravated. The mass fraction of moisture content in oil and paper was calculated at each aging degree. Comparative results revealed that the moisture absorption capacity of insulation paper had an age-related decreasing tendency, whereas the moisture absorption capacity of insulating oil had an age-related increasing tendency. Moisture partition diagrams of mineral and aging-resistant mixed oil-paper samples were compared. Results showed that with the same oil moisture concentration, the moisture of insulation paper impregnated in mixed oil was remarkably lower than that impregnated in mineral oil. © 1994-2012 IEEE.",,,20151700786237,7076783,"Liao, Ruijin (1); Lin, Yuandi (1); Guo, Pei (1); Liu, Haibin (1); Xia, Huanhuan (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Power Equipment and System Security and New Technology, College of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing; 400044, China (2) Yunnan Electric Power Research Institute (Group) Co., Ltd., Kunming; 650051, China ",ITDIES,413 Insulating Materials - 413.2 Heat Insulating Materials - 482.2 Minerals - 513.3 Petroleum Products - 704.2 Electric Equipment - 811.1 Pulp and Paper - 944.2 Moisture Measurements - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Electric transformer insulation - Insulating materials - Mineral oils - Minerals - Moisture - Moisture determination - Oil filled transformers - Thermal aging - Thermal insulation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/TDEI.2015.7076783,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10709878,2,"April 1, 2015",English,Paper,,29.0,842-850,,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,,Thermal aging effects on the moisture equilibrium curves of mineral and mixed oil-paper insulation systems,,Aging experiments - Moisture absorption - Moisture concentration - Moisture equilibrium - Oil moisture content - Oil paper insulation - Oil-paper insulation system - Thermal aging effects,22,

J.,"The running performance of reciprocating piston diaphragm pump spindle affects reciprocating diaphragm pump operating conditions directly, even the effective operation of the entire pipeline transportation systems. Because of the diversity and uncertainty of the diaphragm pump spindle fault, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method of HHT based on EMD. Firstly it can process the original signal vibration data by EMD to get some IMF, then analyze each IMF through Hilbert transform to get HHT marginal spectrum, finally study the HHT marginal spectrum of IMF to achieve equipment fault diagnosis and research.

ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,"A competitive fluorescence method toward tadalafil detection has been developed based on host-guest recognition by selecting rhodamine B (RhB) and p-sulfonated calix[6]arene functionalized graphene (CX6-Gra) as the 'reporter pair'. Upon the presence of tadalafil to the performed CX6-Gra-RhB complex, the RhB molecules are displaced by tadalafil, leading to a 'switch-on' fluorescence signal. The observed fluorescence signal can be used for quantitative detection of tadalafil ranging from 1.00 to 50.00 μM with a detection limit of 0.32 μM (S/N = 3). The inclusion complex of tadalafil and CX6 was studied by molecular docking and the results indicated that a 1:1 host-guest stoichiometry had the lowest ΔG value of -7.18 kcal/mol. The docking studies demonstrated that the main forces including π-π interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions should be responsible for the formation of this inclusion compound. The mechanism of the competitive host-guest interaction was clarified.

Gaodianya Jishu,"The failure rate is an important indicator to develop maintenance strategies. We established a transformer failure model based on semi-Markov process to analyze the failure rate. The model involves thermal aging process and random failure process. The thermal aging process is divided into four states based on average polymerization degree of insulating paper. The transition time between the states of thermal aging process is assumed to obey the Weibull distribution, and the average transition time is obtained by empirical formula. The random failure process includes random failures caused by lightning strikes or short circuits shocks. The transition time between normal state and random failure state is assumed to be exponentially distributed, and the transition rate is obtained through failure statistics. With the variation of the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution, a reasonable failure rate curve can be acquired by the transformer failure model presented. The conclusion can be drawn that the semi-Markov failure model for transformers considering both thermal aging and random failure processes can better reflect the actual transformer failure mechanisms. © 2015, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPI.

However, complex transforming processes of optical state polarization induce illegal linear optical state polarization and illegal circular optical state polarization in Sagnac fiber optic current sensor, then, decrease performance of S-FOCS. According to the parameters of the optical components, we built Jones matrixes and the mathematical model of optical transmission in S-FOCS. Based on polarization state error models of Sagnac fiber optic current sensor, we made experiments to evaluate performances of several key components, including polarizer, quarter-wave retarder and sensing head, then, investigate the influence of several main polarization error factors on S-FOCS's performance practically.

Diangong Jishu Xuebao,"In order to monitor the solidification condition of the dry-type air core reactor, we develop a fiber Bragg grating strain sensor to achieve on-line monitoring for reactor encapsulated strain in solidification. In the production of the dry-type air core reactor encapsulation, the sensor is embedded within the encapsulation so as to monitor the encapsulated strain changes during the solidification process. The results of monitoring show that the shrinkage of the colloid produces negative strain during the solidification process. When the furnace temperature exceeds 50, the negative strain of the encapsulation increases gradually with the growth of the solidification time. After about 8 hours, it tends to be stable. The encapsulation is basically solidified completely at this moment. In the cooling process, the strain increases along the negative direction, and stabilizes at around -5500 μΕ after reaching the room temperature. The monitoring of the encapsulated strain during the solidification process is of significance for ensuring the quality and improving the mechanical properties of the reactor. ©, 2015, Chinese Machine Press.

Ceram Int,"Cryptomelane type manganese oxide α-MnO2and Ni doped KMn8O16nanostructures were synthesized by water-bathing methods at 80 °C for 24 h using NiSO4·H2O as the dopant sources. The structures, morphologies and physical properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the products are Ni doped KMn8O16nanorods after the introduction of NiSO4·H2O during the reaction process. The electromagnetic characteristics and microwave absorption properties of the materials were carried out with a vector network analyzer (VNA) and the transmission line (TML) theory. The dielectric loss and microwave absorption properties of the cryptomelane materials are improved after Ni doping. The thickness dependent reflection loss shows that the peak frequency and effective absorption bandwidth all decrease with the increasing material thickness. With the increase of Ni doping concentration, the peak frequency shifts to higher frequency bands and the effective absorption bandwidth increases. The electromagnetic performance of cryptomelane can be attributed to its unique tunnel structures and the improvement of Ni doping can be due to the enhanced electromagnetic polarization. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",,,20150400450504,,"Wang, Yude (1, 2); Guan, Hongtao (1); Wang, Yan (1); Dong, Chengjun (1); Chen, Gang (1); Xiao, Xuechun (1) ","(1) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",CINNDH,708.1 Dielectric Materials - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Bandwidth - Chromium compounds - Dielectric devices - Dielectric losses - Dielectric materials - Doping (additives) - Electric network analyzers - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Manganese oxide - Microwaves - Nanorods - Nickel sulfates - Oxides - Scanning electron microscopy - Transmission electron microscopy - X ray diffraction - X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.153,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: XT412003, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013Z052, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 201310673002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013FB006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","The authors are grateful to the financial support of the Application Basic Research Fund of Yunnan Province (Grant no. 2013FB006 ), the Youth Talents Program of Yunnan University (Grant no.

Thin Solid Films,"We theoretically investigate the effect of microscopic interface asymmetry (MIA) on the optical properties of short-period InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices (SLs) which can serve for the mid-infrared (mid-IR) detection. To calculate the band structures of such SLs, we use a modified eight-band Kane model which includes the MIA effect. With the band structures, we can evaluate the optical matrix elements and joint density of states for the corresponding SL systems. Based on these obtained results, we employ the Boltzmann equation approach to calculate the optical absorption coefficients for the corresponding SL systems. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the MIA effect can greatly influence the electronic and optical properties of short-period InAs/GaSb type-II SLs. For the band structures, we find that the MIA effect causes strong interactions between different SL subbands and creates large spin splittings of these subbands. For the optical properties, the MIA effect activates the forbidden optical transition channels for TM polarization, enhances the absorption strength considerably and induces remarkable red-shifts for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations, where TE and TM refer to light polarizations along the in-plane and growth directions of SL structure. Different absorption features for TE and TM polarizations are well manifested by corresponding optical matrix elements. Moreover, in conjunction with recent experiment, we calculate the polarization-dependent absorption spectra for mid-IR InAs/GaSb type-II SLs.

Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao,"The internal moisture in corn exists in the states of free water and bound water. It is generally beyond 18% (Wet basis) in the new corn harvested, however, in order to storage safely, the moisture content of corn should be kept below 14%. Therefore, drying becomes an indispensable process in corn's production and processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the dehydration rate of corn by changing the stacking thickness of corn, the density of needle electrode and the electric field intensity in a high voltage needle-disk electric field drying system, as well as to analyze the difference between the traditional natural air drying and hot air drying methods. The results indicated that the dehydration rate increased and then decreased with the increase of the density of needle electrode. When the voltage between the needle and the disk was 40 kV and the separation distance between them was 6.2 cm, the optimum needle electrode density was 170 pieces/m2, but its increasing was not significant. Perhaps the reason was that when the density of the electrode was small, effective electric field intensity was not able to cover all the material. However, when the density of the electrode became larger, the charge distributed on the needlepoint was reduced and the electric field intensity was weakened, and the interference increased between two adjacent needles, which led to the decrease of the dehydration rate. Furthermore, the corn stacking thickness had little effect on the dehydration rate under high voltage electric field. There was no obvious effect on the dehydration rate when the thickness was less than 4.6 cm, but the dehydration rate slightly slowed down with the increasing of the stacking thickness, due to the natural evaporation of moisture in corn. The natural evaporation of moisture occurs mainly in the surface layer of material and the thinner stacking thickness leads to the more natural evaporation and the relative faster dehydration rate. When the stacking thickness was thinner than 1 cm, the dehydration rate under the electric field was double to that by natural drying and the drying time reduced by 50%. On the other hand, when the thickness was equal to 1.9 cm, the electric dehydration rate was 6.5 times higher than the natural drying and the drying time reduced by 85%. Subsequently, when the thickness increased from 1.9 to 4.6 cm, the dehydration rate increased only by 28%. On the contrary, the drying time extended with the increase of the thickness in the natural drying, because the natural drying occurred mainly in the surface layer. However, in the high voltage electric field drying system, electric field was evenly distributed in corn material and drying happened in the interior and surface area of the material at the same time, therefore, the stacking thickness of corn showed a less effect in the high voltage electric field drying system. In conclusion, the high voltage electric field drying is suitable for drying the thicker materials which can effectively reduce the drying space and workload, as well as improve the efficiency of drying. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Aims. The magnetic field in the chromosphere of the quiet sun is too weak to be diagnosed via the general Zeeman effect. To obtain the hidden magnetic field vector, a complete comprehension of the linear polarization produced by scattering and modified by magnetic field is needed. We report a systematic and quantitative investigation of the sensitivity of the fractional linear polarization of the magnesium triplet to a weak magnetic field in the chromosphere, which can be a guide for the diagnostics of a weak magnetic field in the solar chromosphere. Methods. We focus on the fractional linear polarization of the magnesium triplet induced by scattering. We use the quantum theory under the flat-spectrum approximation developed by Landi Degl'Innocenti for the investigation. A seven-level atomic model of magnesium is adopted, while we do not take the radiative transfer or partial frequency redistribution (PRD) into account. Results. Polarization is directly related to the anisotropy factor, and modified by the continuum, collision, and magnetic field as well as dichroism effect. In our calculation, the elastic collision rates found are not large enough to destroy the population imbalances of the lower levels of the b2and b1lines. This is the prerequisite for the lower level Hanle effect and dichroism effect. When considering the dichroism effect, the magnetic field can influence the polarization not only in the line cores but also in the line wings. However, the magnetic field cannot obviously influence the polarization degree in the line wings once the continuum becomes significant. The polarization of the triplet is sensitive to the magnetic field between 0.001 and 0.1 Gauss due to the lower level Hanle effect and between 1 and 10 Gauss due to the upper level Hanle effect. In the lower level Hanle effect dominated region, the Q/ I amplitude of the b4line increases with magnetic field strength because of the coupling among atomic alignments of the involved levels as described in the statistical equilibrium equations, while the amplitudes of the b2and b1lines decrease. In the upper level Hanle effect dominated region, the most sensitive line is the b4. Conclusions. The polarized lower levels and the contribution of dichroism have to be considered to fit the observed profiles of Mg I b triplet in the line cores. Therefore the b2and b1lines can be potential candidates for probing sub-Gauss range magnetic field, because their Q/ I amplitudes are sensitive to the magnetic field strength between 0.001 and 0.1 Gauss due to the lower level Hanle effect. The b4line is suitable for diagnostics of magnetic field between 1 Gauss and 10 Gauss. © ESO 2015.",,Open Access,20150400443094,,"Li, Hao (1, 2); Qu, Zhongquan (1) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming Yunnan; 650011, China (2) Graduate School of University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yuquan Road, Shijingshang Block, Beijing; 100049, China ",AAEJAF,657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 741.1 Light/Optics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics - 942.4 Magnetic Variables Measurements,,,,,Atoms - Dichroism - Gaussian distribution - Magnesium compounds - Magnetic field measurement - Polarization - Quantum theory - Solar system,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1051/0004-6361/201424029,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320746,,,,00046361,,"January 1, 2015",English,Magnetic fields,,39.0,,,2015,EDP Sciences,Astronomy and Astrophysics,,Scattering polarization of Mg I b triplet in solar chromosphere,,Atomic process - Line: Profiles - Magnetic field strengths - Magnetic field vectors - Quantitative investigation - Spectrum approximation - Statistical equilibrium - Sun: Chromosphere,573,

J. Environ. Sci. Health Part A Toxic Hazard. Subst. Environ. Eng.,"Two groups of integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland (IVCW) microcosms were established for treating two types of representative wastewater: domestic and nitrified wastewater under two loading rates (LRs) over about two years. Their removal capacities of organic substance and nitrogen as well as the effects of loading rate (LR), outflow temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration were investigated and compared. Efficient chemical oxygen demand (COD) eliminations were achieved by the IVCWs, with the mass removal rates increasing linearly with the increasing LRs strongly, achieving average value of 56.07 g m-2d-1at the highest loading rate. Nevertheless, the effluent COD concentrations also increased, with the average value exceeding Class I A discharge standard (-1) for municipal wastewater treatment plants in China at the highest loading rate. Greater total nitrogen (TN) mass removal rates but lower efficiencies were obtained at the high LR for both types of wastewater, and better removal was achieved for nitrified wastewater (NW) in comparison to domestic wastewater (DW), probably due to the prevailing anoxic conditions inside the IVCW beds restricted nitrification process of DW. The influences of LR, temperature and DO on COD removal were slight, but all remarkable on TN reduction. As compared to DO, temperature was more crucial for nitrogen removal, and the temperature dependence coefficient for TN removal of low LR of NW was significantly greater than others. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,20151800799684,,"Chang, Jun J.

Int. J. Green Energy,"In this paper, an innovative unglazed solar water collector with its colorbond steel absorber plate also serving as the roof is proposed. Two most common colorbond steel profiles used as roofs, namely the Lysaght BlueOrb colorbond steel with the cosine profile and the Spandek colorbond steel with a trapezoidal shaped profile, are selected as the absorber plates. A theoretical energy balance model is developed to conduct a detailed parametric study on the thermal performance of this innovative unglazed solar collector with both colorbond steel absorber plate profiles under various configuration and operating conditions. The results show that both types of collectors can achieve high thermal efficiency (∼70%) and can increase the water temperature by about 8 °C, indicating they are suitable for the domestic utilization in at least tropical and similar regions as well; The two types of collectors produce very close thermal performances; improved thermal performance can be achieved through optimizing a number of parameters such as using a selective coating for the absorber plate to enhance its optical properties, using slender collector configurations, and using a compromized mass flow rate to maintain a high efficiency and to attain the higher temperature outputs. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,20152901037472,,"Walsh, Matthew (1, 2); Lin, Wenxian (1, 2) ","(1) Solar Energy Research Institute, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, Yunnan, China (2) School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, James Cook University, Townsville; QLD; 4811, Australia ",,702.3 Solar Cells - 741.1 Light/Optics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity,,,,,Energy balance - Optical properties - Roofs - Sandwich structures,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lin, Wenxian(wenxian.lin@jcu.edu.au) ",10.1080/15435075.2013.858045,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15435083,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 11072211, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 20105303110001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: ARC, Sponsor: Australian Research Council; ","The support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11072211), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan",,15435075,12,"December 2, 2015",English,Collector efficiency,,23.0,1309-1322,,2015,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",International Journal of Green Energy,,A Parametric Study on the Thermal Performance of Unglazed Solar Water Collectors with Their Colorbond Steel Absorber Plates Also Used as Roofs,,Energy balance models - Operating condition - Parametric study - Selective coatings - Solar water collectors - Steel absorber plates - Thermal Performance - Water temperatures,12,
Tob. Sci. Technol.,"To determine the chlorophyll content in tobacco leaf real-timely, nondestructively and rapidly, the spectrum of healthy leaves of different vigor of main tobacco cv. Nanjiang No. 3 grown at karst mountain area in Guizhou were collected by a Field Spec 3 portable spectrometer, and the chlorophyll contents in corresponding leaves were determined. The spectral characteristic variables were extracted via spectral analysis, and the correlations of chlorophyll content in tobacco with the original spectrum, first derivative of spectrum and spectral characteristic variables were analyzed. An estimation model for chlorophyll content was established by multivariate stepwise regression and the single variable of spectral characteristics, and the accuracy of the model was tested. The results showed that: the correlation coefficients between chlorophyll a, b and original spectral reflectance peaked at 700 and 701 nm, respectively; those between chlorophyll a, b and spectral derivative reflectance peaked at 623 and 653 nm, respectively; the correlation coefficient between chlorophyll a and spectral characteristic variable λg and that between chlorophyll b and SDr/SDb were the highest.

Wuli Xuebao,"Since its successful preparation in 2004, graphene has attracted a great deal of attention, and the sensing application is an important research field. But nearly all the researches about graphene sensors focus on low frequency band, of which the mechanism is mainly dependent on the detection of charge carrier concentration and conductivity variation induced by the absorption of molecules. However, due to the fact that most of the molecules absorbed on the surface of graphene will induce the change of conductivity, this method is incapable of distinguishing different molecules. Transmission mode of a single molecular layer is studied based on Kubo formula and combined with a numerical method. The relation between transmission properties and effective mode index is analyzed, and the broadband localization capability of the waveguide mode is demonstrated. Meanwhile, the variation of the transmission intensity which is due to the interaction between the first order waveguide mode and the gas is adopted to retrieve the vibration spectrum of molecules. Taking the sensing of SO2, CO and C7H8as examples, the effectiveness of this method is verified based on eigenmode analysis. Results show that the transmission spectrum is consistent with the variation spectrum of gas molecules; besides, in the transmission direction, the larger the interaction range, the greater the attenuation of mode transmission intensity will be. This study has provided a theoretical foundation for the realization of the detection and identification of gas moleculan fingerprints. © 2015 Chinese Physical Society.",,,20154401462472,198102,"Yang, Jing-Jing (1); Li, Jun-Jie (2); Deng, Wei (1); Cheng, Cheng (3); Huang, Ming (1) ","(1) Wireless Innovation Lab of Yunnan University, School of Information Science and Engineering, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Radio Monitoring Center of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650228, China ",WLHPAR,701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 714.3 Waveguides - 761 Nanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics,,,,,Carrier concentration - Graphene - Molecules - Numerical methods - Spectrum analysis - Waveguides,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Ming(huangming@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.7498/aps.64.198102,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10003290,19,"October 5, 2015",Chinese,Vibration analysis,,22.0,,,2015,"Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica,,Transmission mode of a single layer graphene and its performance in the detection of the vibration spectrum of gas molecular,,Detection and identifications - Eigenmode analysis - Single molecular layers - Theoretical foundations - Transmission intensity - Transmission mode - Transmission spectrums - Vibration spectra,64,
RSC Adv.,"Early diagnosis and the timely treatment of cancer are key to improving patient survival rates at present. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consisting of infinite crystalline lattices with metal clusters and organic linkers may provide opportunities for the detection of cancer cells which have remained undiagnosed. Herein, we report that Fe-MIL-101 possesses an intrinsic enzyme mimicking activity similar to that found in natural horseradish peroxidase and shows highly catalytic activity even at neutral pH. The Michaelis constant (Km) of Fe-MIL-101 with H2O2as the substrate is about 616-fold (at pH 4.0) and 20-fold (at pH 7.0) smaller than free natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP), indicating a much higher affinity for H2O2than HRP and most of the peroxidase mimetics. Moreover, Fe-MIL-101 was successfully used to detect cancer cells by conjugating folic acid onto Fe-MIL-101 without any surface modification. The detection limit of the method for HeLa cells was estimated to be 50 cells and the reaction colour produced with 10 cells could also be observed by the naked eye.

The resistivity and minority carrier lifetime of multicrystalline silicon wafers were investigated by four-point probe resistivity tester and μ-PCD, respectively. Annealing temperature, atmosphere and cooling rate were researched. It was found that copper contaminants have a greater impact on the electrical properties of multicrystalline silicon. Research results showed that copper impurities tend to exist at defect sites at high temperature, and high annealing temperature, argon atmosphere and slow cooling conditions make more impact on the electrical properties of multicrystalline silicon than low annealing temperature, air atmosphere and fast cooling. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",,,20150600501778,,"Li, Jiao (1); Chen, Xiu-Hua (1); Ma, Wen-Hui (2); Zhang, Cong (2); Wei, Kui-Xian (2) ","(1) Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) The National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China ",MSFOEP,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 537.1 Heat Treatment Processes - 544.1 Copper - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 951 Materials Science,113089.0,"August 26, 2014 - August 28, 2014","Xi’an, China","2014 - China Functional Material Technology and Industry Forum, CFMTIF 2014",Annealing - Atmospheric temperature - Carrier lifetime - Cooling - Copper - Electric conductivity - Functional materials - Impurities - Polysilicon - Purification - Solidification,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Jiao(ljsilicon@163.com) ",10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.809-810.846,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783038353522.0,02555476,,2015,English,Silicon wafers,,13.0,846-851,1 of 1,2015,Trans Tech Publications Ltd,Materials Science Forum,China Functional Materials Society; Chongqing Materials Research Institute; National Instrument Functional Materials Engineering Technology Research Center,Effects of Cu contamination on the electrical properties of multicrystalline silicon purified by directional solidification route,,Annealing temperatures - Argon atmospheres - Copper contamination - Copper impurities - Four point probe - Minority carrier lifetimes - Multi-crystalline silicon - Multicrystalline silicon wafers,809-810,2014 - China Functional Materials Technology and Industry Forum
Neiranji Gongcheng,"Based on the measurements of the temperature field of piston and cylinder sleeve, the dynamic model of 2D25 diesel piston assembly was established. The effect of piston structural parameters on lube-oil consumption was analyzed by orthogonal experimental design method and conventional method respectively. The results indicate that the radial clearance between piston skirt and cylinder inner wall is the greatest impact on the lube-oil consumption, then the piston head radial clearance and the piston pin offset. The convex position of piston skirt profile, and the stiffness and ovality of piston skirt have little impact on the oil consumption. The lube-oil consumption is independent from the radial clearance between piston skirt and inner wall within the range from 0.06 mm to 0.09 mm, but increases rapidly with the increase of the radial clearance between piston skirt and inner wall within the range from 0.09 mm to 0.15 mm. The lube-oil consumption has a little increment with an increase of the piston head radial clearance. The lube-oil consumption has the lowest value when the piston pin offset to main bearing surface is 0.5 mm, and increases with the increase of the piston pin offset but in a small range of variation. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Internal Combustion Engines.

Electrochim Acta,"The practical commercialization of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) requires persistent exploration of cost-effective counter electrodes (CEs). Aiming at increasing the active sites and accelerating charge transfer of a CE electrocatalyst, cobalt sulfide decorated aniline complexes are synthesized by a reflux technique and subsequently in-situ polymerized for Pt-free polyaniline-cobalt sulfide (PANi-CoS) electrocatalysts in liquid-junction DSSCs. The preliminary results suggest that an enhanced electrocatalytic activity for I3-reduction is ascribed to the fast electron-transfer ability of PANi and the high catalytic activity of CoS. The optimized DSSC device based on PANi-7 wt% CoS yields an impressive power conversion efficiency up to 8.55% under an illumination of air mass 1.5 global simulated solar light, which is much higher than 5.65% and 5.79% for the solar cells with pure PANi and pristine Pt CEs, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Mater. Res. Innov.,"This paper evaluates the in-plane mechanical behaviour of masonry walls strengthened by basalt fibre-reinforced polymer composite material. Based on the seismic performance tests of three masonry walls without any strengthening scheme and three walls with basalt fibre-reinforced polymer strengthening directly under increasing cyclic lateral loading and constant vertical compression loading, the damage characteristics of each specimen were observed. Besides, the ultimate shear strength and deformation performance, ratio of residual deformation, hysteretic behaviour, energy dissipation behaviour, degradation characteristics of bearing capacity and stiffness, fibre strain were analysed. The study results show that the strengthening technique of bonding basalt fibre-reinforced polymer composite material can effectively improve the ultimate shear strength and deformation performance, and the improvement extent of the latter is much larger than that of the former. Those basalt fibre-reinforced polymer-strengthened masonry walls show a distinct slowdown degradation of bear capacity and stiffness, and have better energy dissipation capacity as well as deformation recovery capability. © W.

Math. Probl. Eng.,"This paper makes a discussion on the ranking problem of complex objects where each object is composed of some patterns described by individual attribute information as well as the relational information between patterns. This paper presents a fuzzy collaborative clustering-based ranking approach for this kind of ranking problem. In this approach, a referential object is employed to guide the ranking process. To achieve the final ranking result, fuzzy collaborative clustering is carried on the patterns in the referential object by using the collaborative information obtained from each ranked object. Since the collaborative information of ranking objects is represented by cluster centers and/or partition matrices, we give two forms of the proposed approach. With the aid of fuzzy collaborative clustering, the ranking results can be obtained by comparing the difference of the referential object before and after collaboration with respect to ranking objects. One can find that this proposed ranking approach is totally different from the previous ranking methods because of its completely collaborative clustering mechanism. Moreover, some synthetic examples show that our proposed ranking algorithm is valid. © 2015 Shihu Liu et al.",,Open Access,20153401202615,495829,"Liu, Shihu (1); Chen, Xiaozhou (2); Moughal, Tauqir Ahmed (3, 4); Yu, Fusheng (4) ","(1) School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Key Laboratory of IOT Application Technology of Universities in Yunnan Province, Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming; 650031, China (3) Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Allama Iqbal Open University, Islamabad; 44000, Pakistan (4) School of Mathematical Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing; 100875, China ",,,,,,,Mathematical techniques,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Shihu(liush02@126.com) ",10.1155/2015/495829,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15635147,,,,1024123X,,2015,English,Engineering,,40.0,,,2015,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,Fuzzy collaborative clustering-based ranking approach for complex objects,,Attribute information - Cluster centers - Collaborative clustering - Collaborative information - Ranking algorithm - Ranking approach - Ranking problems - Ranking process,2015,
J. Org. Chem.,"Competing reaction mechanisms, substituent effects, and regioselectivities of Ni(PPh3)2-catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] carboryne-alkyne cycloadditions were characterized by density functional theory using the real chemical systems and solvent effects considered. A putative mechanism involving the following steps was characterized: (1) exothermic carboryne-catalyst complexation and nucleophilic attack by the first alkyne; (2) insertion of the second alkyne, the rate-determining step (RDS) in all four reactions studied; (3) isomerization of reactant-bound complexes; and (4) product elimination and catalyst regeneration. The RDS in three reactions is mediated by free energy barriers of 27.2, 31.1, and 36.6 kcal·mol-1, representative of the corresponding experimental yields of 67, 54, and 33%, respectively. A fourth reaction with 0% experimental yield showed representative RDS free energy barriers of 60.4 kcal·mol-1, which are difficult to surmount even at 90 °C. Alternative pathways leading to differing isomers were similarly characterized and successfully reproduced experimentally determined product regioselectivities. Kinetic data derived from free energy barriers are in quantitative agreement (-1) of the experimental times, affirming the theoretical results as representative of the real chemical transformations. Complementary determinations show the use of truncated models (Ni(PMe3)2, Ni(PH3)2) causes the RDS to vary from step 2 (alkyne insertion) to step 1 (alkyne attack), highlighting the need to employ real chemical systems in modeling these reactions. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20153901300809,,"Mu, Wei-Hua (1); Xia, Shu-Ya (1); Li, Ji-Xiang (1); Fang, De-Cai (2); Wei, Gang (3); Chass, Gregory A.

Energy,"Thermodynamic analyses of regenerative ORC (organic Rankine cycle) driven by low-temperature flue gas waste heat are performed. The heat transfer and flow analyses of a regenerator are also analyzed. A simplified optimal design method to optimize main thermodynamic parameters is proposed for the regenerative ORC driven by flue gas waste heat under different temperature conditions. Results reveal the existence of two characteristic temperatures, namely, Tw1(1) and Tw1(2). If the flue gas inlet temperature Tw1is lower than Tw1(1), then the regenerator should not be equipped, the optimal pinch point temperature difference is the lowest limit value, and the optimal evaporation temperature increases with the increasing flue gas inlet temperature. If Tw1(1) ≤ Tw1≤ Tw1(2), then the regenerator should be equipped, the optimal regenerator effectiveness increases with the increasing flue gas inlet temperature, the optimal pinch point temperature difference is the lowest limit value, and the optimal evaporation temperature is the highest limit value.

Environ. Eng. Sci.,"To evaluate environment hazards of tetracyclines (TCs) on different soils from the north of China, desorption hysteresis index and partition coefficients (Kd) were obtained by sorption-desorption experiments. Five different soils, including black soil (BLA), cinnamon soil (CIN), cultivated loessial soil (CUL), castanozems, and brown soil (BRO), were collected to test the sorption-desorption properties of oxytetracycline (OTC). Molecular properties of TC, chlortetracycline (CTC), and OTC were acquired by quantum chemistry calculations to explain the sorption-desorption differences on CUL. Among the five soils, BLA exhibits strongest adsorption of OTC and the adsorption follows the order of BLA>CIN≈BRO>CUL≈CAS, and the hysteresis index (HI) has an opposite trend at low contamination levels. Among the TCs investigated, sorption follows the order of CTC>TC>OTC on CUL, which is determined by both molecular polarity and steric hindrance. The order of HI is OTC>TC>CTC on CUL. It was found that CUL is most sensitive to TCs' contamination among the five soils and OTC is most labile to induce environment hazards considering its lower Kdthan CTC and TC. This work will help researchers in identifying the most sensitive soil to TCs' contamination, the most dangerous compound among TCs, and the origin of sorption difference, and thus to ameliorate or avoid potential environment hazards of TCs. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,,20154101353842,,"Li, Ye (1); Pan, Tao (1); Miao, Deren (2); Chen, Zhenhe (1); Tao, Yunhai (3) ","(1) National Engineering Research Center of Urban Environmental Pollution Control, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing; 100037, China (2) Department of Chemical Science and Technology, Kunming University, Kunming, China (3) School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",EESCF5,461.6 Medicine and Pharmacology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Antibiotics - Desorption - Hazards - Hysteresis - Plants (botany) - Quantum chemistry - Soil testing - Soils,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Zhenhe(chenzhenhe@cee.cn) ",10.1089/ees.2014.0325,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15579018,,,,10928758,10,"October 1, 2015",English,Soil pollution,,41.0,865-871,,2015,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,Environmental Engineering Science,,Sorption-desorption of typical tetracyclines on different soils: Environment hazards analysis with partition coefficients and hysteresis index,,Contamination levels - Desorption hysteresis - Desorption properties - Molecular properties - Oxytetracyclines (OTC) - Partition coefficient - Quantum chemistry calculations - tetracyclines,32,

Eng. Geol.,"In order to investigate the failure processes and mechanisms of jointed rock slopes, Distinct Element Method (DEM) was applied with a novel bond contact model. The bond contact model is validated by a series of numerical direct shear tests on jointed models and the comparisons to laboratory test results. DEM jointed rock slope models were then generated and two arrangements of joint sets and two types of slope surface were chosen to test the capabilities of the bond contact model. The slope models were destabilized progressively by the critical gravity approach, and both the failure onset and the slope collapse process were analyzed. Microscopic information reveals that the initiation of slope failure can be divided into three phases and is induced from stress concentration within the rock bridges, occurrence of tension cracks, and their propagation and coalescence. The slope surface properties reflected by different damping affect both post-failure configuration and propagation distance of the rock slope.

Soil Tillage Res.,"Effect of synthetic and natural water absorbing soil amendments on soil physical properties, fresh tuber yield and size of potato production was investigated in a field experiment in a semi-arid region in northern China in 2010-2012. Treatments included two different synthetic water absorbing amendments (potassium polyacrylate-PAA, polyacrylamide-PAM) and one natural amendment (humic acid-HA), both as single amendments, and compound amendments (natural combined with a synthetic) and a no amendment control. Soil amendments had highly significant effect (P≤0.01) on soil water holding capacity, soil cone penetration resistance and soil aggregate size fractions, but had no significant effect (P> 0.05) on soil bulk density. Soil amendments increased fresh tuber yield by 4.2-32.9%, increased the proportion of tuber size category 1 (>150. g) and decreased size category 3 ( © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20150200407994,,"Xu, Shengtao (1, 2); Zhang, Lei (3); McLaughlin, Neil B.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"The headspace and the molecular recognition of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) were used to research volatiles of rakkyo and Chinese chive. Their volatiles SERS spectra were obtained using nano-silver colloid as the substrate$ Then, volatiles SERS spectra of rakkyo and Chinese Chive were compared respectively with the volatiles SERS spectra of liquid allyl methyl sulfide, 1-propanethiol, diallyl disulfide and all possible pairings of the three compounds. The results showed that the repeatability of volatiles SERS spectra of rakkyo and Chinese Chive were all good. The volatiles SERS spectrum of rakkyo was basically consistent with the volatiles SERS spectrum of the mixture of liquid allyl methyl sulfide and 1-propanethiol. The volatiles SERS spectrum of rakkyo included both characteristic peaks at 626 and 674 cm-1in volatiles SERS spectrum of allyl methyl sulfide and characteristic peaks at 702, 893, 1024, 1085, 1215 and 1320 cm-1in volatiles SERS spectrum of 1-Propanethiol. The volatiles SERS spectrum of Chinese chive was basically consistent with the volatiles SERS spectrum of the mixture of liquid allyl methyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide. The volatiles SERS spectrum of Chinese chive included both characteristic peak at 674 cm-1in volatiles SERS spectrum of allyl methyl sulfide and characteristic peaks at 407, 577, 716, 1189, 1291 and 1401 cm-1in volatiles SERS spectrum of diallyl disulfide. These illustrated that volatiles of rakkyo contained allyl methyl sulfide and 1-Propanethiol and volatiles of Chinese chive contained allyl methyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide. The volatiles of rakkyo and Chinese chive were different, but they all contained allyl methyl sulfide. All of the above have revealed that the headspace combined with molecular recognition of SERS can be directly used to study volatiles of rakkyo and Chinese chive. The technology under room temperature, can guarantee the volatiles obtained were the primitive constituents in plant volatiles. By comparison with the standard sample, the constituents in plant volatiles can be determined. ©, 2014, Science Press.

Gongcheng Lixue,"For the purposes of rural road concrete pavement slab size optimization, the reduction of slab thickness has the advantage of lowering construction cost. This paper studied the slab size and thickness under positive and negative temperature gradients, and the most adverse locations in slabs where the traffic load is applied. This study conducted the finite element analysis for slabs on Winkler foundation. The research results show that: the slab size influences the maximum tensile stress developed in the slabs more than the thickness, and the thickness can be reduced by decreasing the slab size; small-bay slabs are those slabs that are only subject to the wheel loads, and the critical size of small-bay slab is 2.0 m×2.0 m; the modulus of subgrade reaction has minor impact on the maximum tensile stress of the small-bay slab; for the small-bay slab, when fatigue damage is considered, the critical thickness is 19 cm and 16 cm under positive and negative temperature gradients (15 and -15), respectively. The results may provide a reference to the rural road pavement structure optimization design, which leads to cost saving. ©, 2015, Tsinghua University.

Ind. Crops Prod.,"Seed oil has long been recognized as an important source of food, industry and biodiesel. In biological aspect, seed oil fatty acid composition (FAC) affects lipid fluidity and cellular metabolism, depending on temperature. Hence, the variation of FAC in seeds may reflect adaptive strategies for seed survival and seedling establishment under contrasting climate conditions. In this study, we investigated the relative effects of phylogeny and climate on seed oil FAC, testing the hypothesis that the degree of fatty acid unsaturation increases in colder climates. A large seed oil FAC dataset representing 747 species from 207 sites across China was compiled and a general linear model was used to partition total variance in FAC into taxonomic ranks (family, genus and species) and environmental components. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the relative effects of mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Phylogenetically independent contrast (PIC) analysis was used to test the evolutionary association of FAC with climate at the family level. The results showed that seed oil FAC varied considerably across plant species, with phylogeny explaining a greater proportion of variance than environment; however, FAC showed obvious large-scale spatial patterns. Total unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content increased with increasing latitude. The degree of fatty acid unsaturation, as indicated by the ratio of UFA to saturated fatty acids and iodine value, was negatively correlated with MAT and to a lesser extent with MAP. The PIC results indicated that at the family level, nearly all significant phenotypic correlations of FAC with spatial and climatic variables were evolutionarily convergent. These results indicate that despite strong phylogenetic constraints on FAC, fatty acid unsaturation in seed oil appears to evolve as an adaptive strategy in colder climates. The affiliation of phylogenetic and climate in seed oil FAC may assist in the search of potential oil plants with particular FAC for food and fuel needs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20150600505844,,"Zhang, Jiao-Lin (1); Zhang, Shi-Bao (2); Zhang, Yi-Ping (1); Kitajima, Kaoru (3, 4) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Tropical Forest Ecology, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mengla, Yunnan; 666303, China (2) Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan; 650201, China (3) Division of Forest and Biomaterials Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto; 606-8502, Japan (4) Department of Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville; FL; 32611, United States ",ICRDEW,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 821.4 Agricultural Products - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,,,,,Biology - Climate change - Regression analysis - Saturated fatty acids - Seed - Unsaturated fatty acids,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Jiao-Lin(zjl@xtbg.org.cn) ",10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.10.045,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: XTBG-F01, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: XTBG-T01, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: 2012HB039, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: 31270453, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31470470, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on this manuscript and the researchers who measured the data compiled in this study.

Theor Comput Sci,"We consider a version of parallel machine scheduling with rejection. An instance of the problem is given by m identical parallel machines and a set of n independent jobs, with each job having a processing time and a penalty. A job may be accepted to be processed or be rejected at its penalty. The objective of the problem is to partition the set of jobs into two subsets, the subset of accepted and the subset of rejected jobs, and to schedule the set of accepted jobs such that the makespan is minimized under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected jobs is no more than a given bound. In this paper, we present a 2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time for the problem. We also present a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time is O(nmO(1/Ε2)+mn2) for the problem. Moreover, for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant m, our results lead to a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the problem. Our result is fairly good in the sense that in a reasonable size of jobs, our FPTAS improves previous best running time from O(nm+2/Εm) to O(1/Ε2m+3+ mn2). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20155201730893,,"Li, Weidong (1); Li, Jianping (1); Zhang, Xuejie (1); Chen, Zhibin (2) ","(1) Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",TCSCDI,912.2 Management - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Approximation algorithms - Business machines - Scheduling,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Chen, Zhibin(chenzhibin11@gmail.com) ",10.1016/j.tcs.2015.10.007,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 61170222, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11461081, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11126315, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11301466, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11101193, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2014FB114, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2011FZ065, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; ","We are grateful to the anonymous referees for numerous helpful comments and suggestions which helped to improve the presentation of our work.

For. Ecol. Manage.,"We were interested in how forest type and complexity of vegetation influence the diversity of canopy spiders in the rainforest of Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. We sampled spiders by fogging tree canopies in four replicate sites of five different forest types once in the middle of the rainy season, forest types were tropical seasonal rainforest; monsoon forest; mountain rainforest; Aporusa yunnanensis forest; and rubber plantation. From a total of 20 sites and 1000m2projected area we collected 4999 adult spiders of 472 species. Vegetational structure (number of plant forms, such as herbs, shrubs, trees, epiphytes and lianas), tree coverage, shrub coverage, grass coverage, tree height and elevation characterize the environmental conditions in different types of forest. Species richness and mean abundance differed significantly between rubber plantations and natural habitats. Rubber plantations harbored only 42.6-50% of the spider species in the natural forests, and 63.8% of the species in the A. yunnanensis forests. Spider guild composition also differed among forest types. Sheet-line weavers dominated the spider assemblages in natural forests with complex vegetational structure, such as tropical seasonal rainforests and monsoon forests. In contrast, cursorial hunters dominated forests with a more simple structure, such as rubber plantations and A. yunnanensis forest. These results show that intensive management practices in rubber plantations decrease the complexity of the vegetation and, so, strongly influence the diversity and composition of canopy spider assemblages. A lower intensity of management and the restoration of native vegetation may help balance the opposing needs of economic development and biodiversity conservation in this region. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20150200404857,,"Zheng, Guo (1, 2); Li, Shuqiang (1); Yang, Xiaodong (3) ","(1) Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100101, China (2) College of Life Science and Chemistry, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang; 110034, China (3) Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yunnan; 666303, China ",FECMDW,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454 Environmental Engineering - 818.1 Natural Rubber,,,,,Atmospheric thermodynamics - Biodiversity - Conservation - Fog dispersal - Rubber - Rubber plantations - Vegetation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Shuqiang ",10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.031,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: LJQ2012094, Acronym: NCET, Sponsor: Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Number: 31372157, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31372224, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 31025023, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: NSFC-31172121, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","We thank Hong Wang from Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden for identification of plants.

Nano Energy,"Silicon nanowire (SiNW) shows striking light-concentration ability and thus holds promising application potentials in photonic devices. However, its narrow working waveband strongly affects its performance over the entire visible spectrum. Here, a silver capped SiNW structure (Ag-cap/SiNW) is presented to broaden the working waveband of the pure SiNW. Discrete dipole approximation simulations show that, by this structure, the light-concentration waveband can be significantly broadened from 440-620. nm (pure SiNW) to 300-620. nm. Thus, using the Ag-cap/SiNW in the solar cell, the ideal photocurrent density can be enhanced 16% compared with that using pure SiNW. Furthermore, the concentrated light shows the feature of the strong near-surface distribution around the Ag-cap/SiNW. This distribution feature gives a reasonable explanation for the huge superiority of the radial junction SiNW solar cells to axial junction SiNW solar cells from optical aspect. Additionally, due to the intrinsic waveguide property of SiNW, this Ag-cap/SiNW also has great potential applications in photonic devices such as nanoscale optical biosensors and light-integrated-chips. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20150500477064,,"Li, Yingfeng (1); Li, Meicheng (1, 2); Song, Dandan (1); Liu, Hong (3); Jiang, Bing (1); Bai, Fan (4); Chu, Lihua (1) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University, Beijing; 102206, China (2) Su Zhou Institute, North China Electric Power University, Suzhou; 215123, China (3) State Key Laboratory of Crystal Materials, Shandong University, Jinan; 250100, China (4) Yunnan Institute of Products Quality Inspection, Yunnan; 650000, China ",,547.1 Precious Metals - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 702.3 Solar Cells - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Nanowires - Photonic devices - Quantum efficiency - Silicon - Silicon compounds - Silicon solar cells - Silver - Silver compounds - Solar cells,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Meicheng ",10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.054,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 20120036120006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20110036110006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20130036110012, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: SYG201215, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Suzhou University of Science and Technology; Number: 50972032, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51202067, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61204064, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 91333122, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51172069, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51402106, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51372082, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","IThis work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 51402106 , 51372082 , 51172069 , 50972032 , 61204064 , 51202067 and 91333122 ), Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant nos. 20110036110006 , 20120036120006 , 20130036110012 ), Science and Technology Program Foundation of Suzhou City ( SYG201215 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities .

Chem. Phys. Lett.,"Theoretical studies examining a series of binuclear transition metal pentazolides Rh2(N5)4predict paddle wheel type structures with very short metal-metal distances. Natural bonding orbital analysis indicated that the bonding between the metal atom and the five-membered ring is predominantly ionic for Rh2(N5)4species, and a high-order metal-metal multiple bonding exists between the two metal atoms. In addition, the presence of the delocalized π orbital plays an important role in the stabilization of Rh2(N5)4.

Anal. Chim. Acta,"Partial least squares (PLS) is one of the most widely used methods for chemical modeling. However, like many other parameter tunable methods, it has strong tendency of over-fitting. Thus, a crucial step in PLS model building is to select the optimal number of latent variables (nLVs). Cross-validation (CV) is the most popular method for PLS model selection because it selects a model from the perspective of prediction ability. However, a clear minimum of prediction errors may not be obtained in CV which makes the model selection difficult. To solve the problem, we proposed a new strategy for PLS model selection which combines the cross-validated coefficient of determination (Qcv2) and model stability (S). S is defined as the stability of PLS regression vectors which is obtained using model population analysis (MPA). The results show that, when a clear maximum of Qcv2 is not obtained, S can provide additional information of over-fitting and it helps in finding the optimal nLVs. Compared with other regression vector based indictors such as the Euclidean 2-norm (B2), the Durbin Watson statistic (DW) and the jaggedness (J), S is more sensitive to over-fitting. The model selected by our method has both good prediction ability and stability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",,,20152000842112,,"Deng, Bai-Chuan (1, 2); Yun, Yong-Huan (2); Liang, Yi-Zeng (2); Cao, Dong-Sheng (3); Xu, Qing-Song (4); Yi, Lun-Zhao (5); Huang, Xin (2) ","(1) Department of Chemistry, University of Bergen, Bergen; N-5007, Norway (2) School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (3) School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (4) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, Changsha; 410083, China (5) Yunnan Food Safety Research Institute, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China ",ACACAM,921.6 Numerical Methods,,,,,Chemical analysis - Forecasting - Stability,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liang, Yi-Zeng(yizeng_liang@263.net) ",10.1016/j.aca.2015.04.045,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18734324,"Number: 81402853, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21075138, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21175157, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21275164, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21465016, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21105129, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: </GN1>, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","This work is financially supported by the National Nature Foundation Committee of P.R.

Biotechnol. Biotechnol. Equip.,"A major problem in the treatment of breast cancer at present is the lack of more sensitive and specific tumour biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were first discovered as important regulators of development in Caenorhabditis elegans, and their functions have been widely investigated. miR-155 is an oncogenic miRNA which has been explored mainly in leukaemia but is also known to play an important role in the progression of breast cancer. There is an accumulating body of evidence about additional roles of miR-155 in the development of breast cancer. In this mini-review, we provide an overview and update of miR-155 expression and its roles in breast cancer. We also attempt to summarize the current understanding of miR-155 regulation networks and speculate on the potential of miR-155 as a putative accessory parameter for diagnosis of breast cancer. © 2015 The Author(s).

Nanoscale,"We report the observation of random lasing from Eu3+doped borate glass ceramic films embedded with Ag nanoparticles through three-photon absorption at room temperature. Under 1179 nm ultrashort femtosecond pulse excitation, discrete sharp peaks with linewidth ∼0.4 nm emerge randomly from a broad emission band with peak wavelength at ∼612 nm. In addition, the number of sharp peaks increases with the increase of excitation power. We also show that the emission spectrum varies with different observation angles and the corresponding lasing threshold is dependent on the excitation area. Hence, we verify unambiguously that the Eu3+doped borate glass ceramic film supports random lasing action via three-photon absorption excitation.

The main factors including Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering in path radiance, as well as the other satellite image parameters (such as height modification, slope distance and azimuth), ware considered in the algorithm. The algorithm consists of three steps. First, starting band haze values are selected using histogram of a single image. Then predicted haze values were calculated using a known scattering model and the multispectral normalized gains and offset values. Finally, final predicted haze values are obtained by the predicted haze values and haze values.

Food Res. Int.,"Ophiocordyceps sinensis (DCXC) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine that exhibits various health-promoting effects. However, counterfeits and mimics of DCXC are frequently found in markets. In the present study, we examined the potential of quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) coupled with ultrafast liquid chromatography (UFLC) for use in the authentication of DCXC. Metabolite fingerprinting was obtained and subjected to multivariate statistical analysis. Discrimination of genuine DCXC, its counterfeits, cultured mycelia, and mimics was carried out by principal component analysis-discriminant analysis (PCA-DA). Furthermore, 18 characteristic markers efficiently distinguishing DCXC and its adulterants were selected by creation of profile plots displaying the abundances of markers. Determination of molecular formulae and tentative identification of marker compounds were conducted using elemental formula calculation and online database searches based on accurate MS mass and MS/MS fragmentation information. These results suggested that UFLC-QTOF-based metabolomics has great potential for the rapid detection of DCXC adulteration. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20153001061836,,"Zhang, Jiukai (1); Wang, Ping (1); Wei, Xun (2); Li, Li (1); Cheng, Haiyan (3); Wu, Yajun (1); Zeng, Wenbo (4); Yu, Hong (4); Chen, Ying (1) ","(1) Agro-Product Safety Research Center, Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing; 100123, China (2) China Rural Technology Development Center, Beijing; 100045, China (3) AB Sciex (China) Co.

Internet People Assoc. Symp./Workshops, UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP","In order to improve the energy efficiency, delivery ratio and latency, this paper presents WAT (Wakeup Adapting Traffic), a novel receiver-initiated duty cycle protocol for wireless sensor networks. WAT reduces sensor nodes' duty cycle by enabling a receiver to choose a wakeup interval adapted to traffic, and then produce the next wakeup time randomly. WAT introduces an efficient duty cycle schedule and retransmission mechanism to achieve low collisions and high efficiency retransmission. We evaluate WAT in simulation and compare it to the prior duty cycle protocols of RI-MAC and X-MAC. Under the scenarios with a 7×7 grid network and the scenarios with a random network with 50-nodes, WAT significantly outperforms X-MAC.

Open Civ. Eng. J.,"Underground oil pipelines are made of pressurized pipes, and when damage occurs, the consequences can be disastrous. Pipeline accidents caused by stress can be attributed to material corrosion, impractical design, manufacturing defect, environmental damage, and man-made destruction. In this study, by utilizing the stress analysis software CAESAR II, the stress of pipelines in high and steep slope areas was analyzed under the same operating conditions and different piping technologies. Comparing the different simulation consequences of each pipeline technology, an optimized laying process was proposed to reduce the stress of underground oil pipelines in high and steep slope areas; this process was named Sectional Pipe Laying Process. According to the results of CAESAR II, the stress and movement of underground oil pipelines in high and steep slope areas were drastically reduced and the safety greatly enhanced. © Huang et al.",,Open Access,20163902849755,,"Huang, Kun (1); Wu, Jin (1); Hu, Meilin (2); Xiang, Han (3); Zhang, Zhihao (1) ","(1) School of Petroleum Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China (2) PetroChina Kunlun Gas Ltd. of Yunnan, Kunming, China (3) Chengdu E Ga Petroleum Engineering Technology Co., LTD of Sichuan, Chengdu, China ",,"619.1 Pipe, Piping and Pipelines - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Petroleum pipelines - Stress analysis - Stresses,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Jin(casiou@163.com) ",10.2174/1874149501509010477,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18741495,,,,,1,2015,English,Pipelines,,9.0,477-483,,2015,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V., P.O.

"Proc. Int. Workshop Robot Motion Control, RoMoCo","Normally regarding control of robotics one studies how to control the robot, for example, how to plan and control its motions; however, in the current paper we pretend to teach the robot how to control people. Nowadays humanoid robots are being harnessed to new kinds of tasks unknown before, such as amusement, a function that was intended for pets, for example. One of the practical uses of robots-humanoids might be in guiding blind people, thereby substituting for guide dogs. The guided-humanoids would have algorithms that plan motion, GPS built-in sensors, and video cameras. The proposed system will be controlled by a smart-phone monitor and will be voice-controlled. On the other hand, the CBT - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a relatively new psychotherapy methodology, has become a more prevalent practice, justifying its computerization. These interdisciplinary considerations led to additional progress, resulting in trained robots, namely, robots that communicate according to the CBT methodology, by also using another conversation mode: gesturing. This methodology is based on computer-assisted (now extended to humanoid-assisted) cognitive behavioral therapy methodology (CBT). CBT was originally developed for psychological treatment and is often used to reveal and treat personality disorders. This methodology can also be used to evaluate the reliability of a witness. CBT methodology assumes that the cognitive thoughts of people are expressed by their language. In the literature, about ten categories of thoughts have been determined, and so-called distorted thoughts indicate a behavioral deviation. Based on the above assumption, it is possible to map thoughts, including distorted thoughts and analyze them methodically with the help of linguistic tools. Thus, these tools will be able to scan the mapping of an individual's thoughts and discover distorted thoughts as classified by the CBT method. We will use extreme situations as examples to illustrate distorted thoughts. The mentioned situations will refer to time description (always, never), location (everywhere, nowhere), quantity (everything, nothing, nobody), possibility (must, forced, incapable), among others. These types of expressions leave no doubt as to their meaning. The social-robot's role is to find some textual forms (distorted thoughts) and replace them by other textual forms (corrected, proposed texts). The theoretical background and its implementation will be demonstrated herein. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20164502991601,7219735,"Ophir, D.

Dianli Xitong Zidonghue,"In a small hydropower (SHP) enriched area, accurate forecast of SHP generation is very important for ensuring power grid safety and coordinating SHP generation with other power sources. Different from the generation forecast of large hydropower, most SHP stations are located in remote mountainous areas where information gathering is hard and management weak, making it nearly impossible to make use of the locally available forecast methods. By considering the actual situation of SHP stations, and with the SHP stations of an area as the object, a SHP generation forecast method is proposed. This method uses the improved BP neural network as the forecast model and partial mutual information to select remarkable input variables. In the power forecast stage, climate forecast system (CFS) data is used to get the precipitation of the target area and as the input of the model to forecast SHP generation.

By combining the IGVMG method and Chen’s extrapolation formula, a new extrapolation multiscale multigrid (EXMMG) method for a second order elliptic problem is constructed. Then the IGVMG method is used to solve the solutions for coarse grid and finest grid, respectively. Chen’s extrapolation formula is applied to update the approximate solution of coarse grid, and the cubic interpolation operator is applied to provide a better initial value on fine grid from coarse grid.

Hanjie Xuebao,"The fatigue crack propagation rate with probability (P) for welded by joints of ADB610 steel were investigated through fatigue crack propagation experiments. The joints were welded using shielded metal arc welding method. Twice seven data fitting method was adopted to calculate fatigue crack propagation rate of each sample in a series of same crack length. And it was calculated for the standard deviation of logarithmic fatigue crack propagation rate, and fatigue crack propagation rate with P=50%, P=90%, P=95%, P=99%, P=99.9% of base material(BM), heat affected zone (HAZ) and welded material (WM). The results show that the dispersibility of fatigue crack propagation in BM is the least, and the one in WM is the maximum. And when the probability is in the same, the speed of crack propagation in BM is the quickest and the one in WM is the slowest during the early stage of fatigue crack propagation, but during the last stage of fatigue crack propagation the difference of crack propagation speed in BM, HAZ and WM is not significant. And with the probability increase, it is decreased for the crack length corresponding to the insignificant difference for the three zones. ©, 2015, Harbin Research Institute of Welding.

Silicon,"The boron removal from metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) was studied using a K2CO3-CaO-SiO2molten slag refining technique. The variation trend of boron concentration in the refined MG-Si was obtained experimentally under different content of K2CO3in a ternary slag and under different refining times. The results showed that the boron concentration in MG-Si was minimally reduced from 22 ppmw to 1.8 ppmw with a slag composition of 20 % K2CO3-36 % CaO-44 % SiO2and a slag/MG-Si ratio (mass) of 1:1. The boron concentration was reduced with the prolongation of refining time and the increase of K2CO3concent in calcium silicate slag. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of mixed and refined K2CO3-CaO-SiO2-B2O3slag showed that the generated negative ion (BO3)3−will be combined into complex salts K2O⋅2B2O3and K2O⋅4B2O3instead of CaO⋅B2O3in refined slag. The kinetic experiments showed that the total mass transfer coefficient of boron removal using 5 % K2CO3-43 % CaO-52 % SiO2, 10 % K2CO3-40 % CaO-50 % SiO2, 15 % K2CO3-38 % CaO-47 % SiO2and 20 % K2CO3-36 % CaO-44 % SiO2slag refining, respectively, is 7.8×10−6m⋅s−1, 8.3×10−6m⋅s−1, 20.5×10−6m⋅s−1and 25.2×10−6m⋅s−1.

Dianli Xitong Zidonghue,"With large-scale integration of wind farms and photovoltaic plants into the power system, it becomes necessary to take the wind power and photovoltaic power uncertainty into consideration during optimal power flow (OPF) calculation. The traditional Monte Carlo simulation method cannot be used for the thousands of stochastic simulations required to achieve a rational result. Hence the digital nets (DN) method with equivalent distribution sample values is proposed to improve the sample value coverage of random variable input spaces. And the method is used in the OPF calculation of power system containing wind farms and photovoltaic plants. The accuracy and validity of the proposed method tested on an IEEE 30-bus system and the simulation results show that the proposed method has the advantages of fast computation and high accuracy while capable of estimating the probability distribution of the output random variables and dealing with the uncertainties in the electricity market. Then the DN method is applied to an IEEE 300-bus system to study the influence of different capacities of photovoltaic plants on the location marginal price. Furthermore, a comparison between the wind farm/photovoltaic plant hybrid system and single wind farm system has led to the conclusion that the location marginal price, net loss and branch active power of the former are less volatile. ©2015 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press",,,20151800797329,,"Pan, Xiong (1, 3); Zhang, Long (2); Huang, Jiadong (4); Wang, Lili (4); Wu, Ruihua (1) ","(1) Grid Planning & Research Center, Yunnan Power Grid Corporation, Kunming; 650011, China (2) Electric Power Research Institute, State Grid Henan Electric Power Company, Zhengzhou; 450003, China (3) Postgraduate Workstation of Yunnan Power Grid Company, North China Electric Power University, Kunming; 650217, China (4) State Key Laboratory for Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University, Baoding; 071003, China ",DXZIE9,"615.8 Wind Power (Before 1993, use code 611 ) - 706.1 Electric Power Systems - 723.4 Artificial Intelligence - 752.4 Acoustic Generators - 921 Mathematics - 922.1 Probability Theory - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics - 961 Systems Science",,,,,Acoustic generators - Electric load flow - Electric power system interconnection - Electric utilities - Hybrid systems - Intelligent systems - Photovoltaic cells - Probability distributions - Random variables - Stochastic models - Stochastic systems - Uncertainty analysis - Wind power,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Long(zhanglong4ever@163.com) ",10.7500/AEPS20141008012,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10001026,7,"April 10, 2015",Chinese,Monte Carlo methods,,17.0,35-40,,2015,Automation of Electric Power Systems Press,Dianli Xitong Zidonghua/Automation of Electric Power Systems,,Probabilistic optimal power flow calculation based on digital nets method,,PhotoVoltaic plant - Probabilistic optimal power flows - Quasi Monte Carlo methods - Van der Corput sequence - Wind farm,39,

First, relying on EEMD's high ability against modal aliasing, we decomposed the original signals based on the size of frequency range, then identified the IMF containing the dominant mode by using the weight of signal energy, finally analyzed the IMF using Prony algorithm and thus obtained the modal parameters of low-frequency oscillation signals.

Biotechnol. Lett.,"Objectives: As activin/nodal signaling plays a key role in definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation, we have explored activin A-induced differentiation of DE from human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells (hPESCs). Results: Administration of 5 ng activin A/ml had no effect on the expression of markers of DE differentiation. However, higher concentrations of activin A (50 and 100 ng/ml) upregulated Sox17 and Cxcr4, as well upregulating the mesendodermal precursor marker, Brachyury. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that low dose activin A can maintain the undifferentiated potency of hPESCs, whereas higher doses induce DE differentiation; 50 ng/ml is the optimal concentration for inducing DE from hPESCs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,20151600749076,,"Wang, Zhiqiang (1); Li, Wenliang (1); Chen, Tianxing (2); Yang, Jun (1); Wen, Zhengqi (1); Yan, Xinmin (3); Shen, Tao (3); Liang, Rui (2) ","(1) Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming; 650032, China (2) Department of Pathology, The First People’s Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650032, China (3) Institute of Basic Medicine of the First People’s Hospital of Yunnan Province, Center of Clinical Molecular Biology of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650032, China ",BILED3,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 921.2 Calculus,,,,,Cell culture - Cell signaling - Differentiation (calculus) - Glycoproteins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liang, Rui(ruiliang131@hotmail.com) ",10.1007/s10529-015-1829-x,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15736776,,,,01415492,8,"August 1, 2015",English,Stem cells,,18.0,1711-1717,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Biotechnology Letters,,Activin A can induce definitive endoderm differentiation from human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells,,Activin A - De-differentiation - Definitive endoderm - Embryonic stem cells - Low dose - Optimal concentration,37,
Soc. Netw. Analysis Min.,"With the increasing popularity of social networks, it is becoming more and more crucial for the decision makers to analyze and understand the evolution of these networks to identify for example, potential business opportunities. Unfortunately, understanding social networks, which are typically complex and dynamic, is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose an effective and practical approach for simulating social networks. We first develop a social network model that considers growth and connection mechanisms (including addition and deletion) of social networks. We consider the nodes’ in-degree, inter-nodes’ close degree which indicates how close the nodes are in the social network, which is limited by the in-degree threshold. We then develop a graph-based stratified random sampling algorithm for generating an initial network. To obtain the snapshots of a social network of the past, current and the future, we further develop a close degree algorithm and a close degree of estimation algorithm. The degree distribution of our model follows a power-law distribution with a “fat-tail”. Experimental results using real-life social networks show the effectiveness of our proposed simulation method. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,,20180604761294,6,"Zeng, Rui (1); Sheng, Quan Z.

J. Liq. Chromatogr. Relat. Technol.,"Herbal medicines have been shown to change chemical constituents upon different processing approaches, which might lead to different pharmacological activities and therapeutic effects. In this study, raw and processed Gentiana rigescens (wine-, vinegar-, and salt water-processed) were extracted and profiled by ultra-fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) and Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR). Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) based on FT-MIR revealed potential relationships between raw and processed samples, while the processed sample displayed chemical variation. Partial least-squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was used for screening the marker metabolites. The results indicated that UFLC-UV-MS/MS and FT-MIR fingerprints with chemometrics could effectively evaluate the quality of G. rigescens under different processed approaches. Eight compounds were selected as potential marker metabolites for contributing to the most effective classification of raw and processed samples. In addition, these potential marker metabolites were tentatively identified by matching mass information with the fragmentation patterns of the published literature or standard compounds. These results revealed that UFLC-UV-MS/MS and FT-MIR methods coupled with chemometrics could provide an effective platform for monitoring quality variations of G. rigescens under different processed approaches. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,20153301162337,,"Pan, Yu (1, 2); Zhang, Ji (1); Shen, Tao (3); Zhao, Yan-Li (1); Zuo, Zhi-Tian (1); Wang, Yuan-Zhong (1); Li, Wan-Yi (1, 2) ","(1) Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 2238, Beijing Road, Panlong District, Kunming; 650200, China (2) College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China (3) College of Resources and Environment, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi, China ",JLCTFC,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 801 Chemistry - 801.2 Biochemistry - 913.3 Quality Assurance and Control - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 961 Systems Science",,,,,Biomolecules - Cluster analysis - Drug products - Hierarchical systems - Infrared devices - Infrared spectroscopy - Least squares approximations - Liquid chromatography - Mass spectrometry - Metabolites,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yuan-Zhong(boletus@126.com) ",10.1080/10826076.2015.1053912,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),1520572X,"Number: 2013FC006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013FD050, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2014FD068, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013FD066, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013FZ150, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 81260608, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81260608); the Key Project of Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2013FC006); and the Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2013FZ150, 2013FD050, 2013FD066, and 2014FD068).",,10826076,14,"August 27, 2015",English,Quality control,,43.0,1407-1416,,2015,"Taylor and Francis Inc., 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800, Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States",Journal of Liquid Chromatography and Related Technologies,,Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry Combined with Fourier Transform Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy and Chemometrics for Comparative Analysis of Raw and Processed Gentiana rigescens,,Chemometrics - FT-MIR - LC-MS/MS - markermetabolites - processed Gentiana rigescens - qualityvariations,38,

Int. J. Coal Geol.,"The Lincang Neogene high-Ge coal deposit in Yunnan, southwestern China, is one of the major coal-hosted Ge deposits in the world. This study reports new data on the petrological, mineralogical, and geochemical compositions of 57 samples (including coal bench samples, roofs, floors, partings, and batholith granite) of three high-Ge coal seams (S3, Z2, and X1) from the Dazhai Mine, Lincang Ge ore deposit, and provides new insights into the origin and modes of occurrence of the minerals and elements present.The coals have huminite random reflectances in the 0.33-0.48% range. On a mineral-free basis, the coal samples are dominated by huminite-group macerals, all having more than 88.5% total huminite. Ulminite and attrinite generally dominate the huminite macerals. Structured inertinite is rare, with funginite being the most abundant inertinite form. The minerals in the coals are mainly composed of quartz, and, to a lesser extent, kaolinite, illite, and mica. A hydrous beryllium sulfate phase (BeSO4·4H2O) is present in the low temperature ashes of several coal samples.Compared to average values for world low-rank coals, beryllium (up to 2000 μg/g and 343. μg/g on average), Ge (up to 2176 μg/g and 1590 μg/g on average), and W (up to 339 μg/g and 170. μg/g on average) are unusually enriched in the Lincang coals, with a concentration coefficient >. 100 (CC = ratio of element concentration in investigated coals vs. world low-rank coals); elements As (156. μg/g on average), Sb (38. μg/g), Cs (25.2 μg/g), and U (52.5 μg/g) are significantly enriched (10 2-bearing and volcanogenic CO2-bearing fluids, which led to the enrichment of trace elements, not only including assemblages of Ge-W and Be-Nb-U (both leached from granite and the deposited in the peat), but also As-Sb (from volcanogenic solution), as well as the alteration and argillization of the batholith granites, and the formation of carbonate and quartz-carbonate metasomatites. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20150300419692,,"Dai, Shifeng (1); Wang, Peipei (1); Ward, Colin R.

Under different current conditions, the three kinds of contact materials properties of arc duration, arc energy, welding force, contact resistance were investigated. The results show that, with the increase of CuO content, the breaking arc duration of AgCuO electrical contact material increases. AgCuO (10) is more stable than the other samples of breaking arc duration. With the increase of current, the welding force of AgCuO electrical contact materials increases in different degrees. When the current is less than 20A, AgCuO (12) in the fusion welding performance is better than others. When the current is greater than 20A, AgCuO (10) in the fusion welding performance is more excellent.

Anal. Methods,"This research has developed an enolisation-silylation with accelerated solvent extraction (ASE)-automated gel permeation chromatography (GPC)-solid phase extraction (SPE)-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analytical method for the simultaneous determination of twelve steroidal and phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in water, sediment and biological samples. The parameters of ASE have been optimized as follows: ethyl acetate as the extraction solvent, a static extraction time of 5 min, and 3 extraction cycles at 80 °C and 60°C for sediment and biological samples, respectively. Clean-up of extracts was carried out by GPC with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. The target compounds were eluted in the fraction from 7-14 min retention time, and then the extracts were obtained by solid phase extraction with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges after elution with 15 mL ethyl acetate.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","Novel twin-layered SnO2well-oriented nanorods arrays have been synthesized by a substrate-free hydrothermal route of using sodium stannate and sodium hydroxide at 190 °C for 48 h. The characteristic results of the morphology and structure show that the synthesized nanoarray can be well indexed to tetragonal phase SnO2nanorods with a diameter of 20 nm and length of several hundred nanometers. The twin-layered SnO2nanorods array was tightly combined together by two layers of nanrods array with an apparent interface in the center. The results of the gas-sensing characteristics for various volatile organic compounds show that the sensor based on layered SnO2nanoarray exhibits the highest gas sensitivity, very fast response and recovery to isopropanol at the operating temperature of 250 °C, and good gas-sensing performances to ethanol and acetone have also been found at the operating temperature of 278 and 300 °C, respectively. The enhanced response is attributed to the numbers of the gas transport channels increasement leading to more effective surface areas and the additional modulation of the sensor resistance due to the potential barrier at nanorod/nanorod junctions of twin-layered SnO2well-oriented nanorods array. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Struct. Health Monit Integr. Mgmt. - Proc. Int. Conf. Struct. Health Monit Integr. Mgmt. ICSHMIM,"Because of the complex geological structure of mountains and the variable climate, geological disasters such as landslides or subsidence often occur. For the strong electromagnetic interference of substations and other factors, the Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain pile can be used to monitor the strain on mountain slope substations and to reflect the stability of slopes. According to the actual slope situation of the Chuxiong Yaozhan 220 kV substation, we made self-locking end FBG strain sensors and bored them in the north slope of the substation by drilling and perfusion in order to set up the fiber Bragg grating strain pile. When a slope landslide or subsidence occurs, the sliding soil drives the strain pile to be strained and the strain force is passed to the strain sensor; the sensor center wavelength variation may reflect the stability of the slope. Monitoring results showed that during the period from May 9 to June 7 the maximum strain of the strain pile was 420μΕ, appearing in the 1 m place of the first strain pile. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,20155101690876,,"Wang, Hong-Liang (1); Peng, Li (2); Zhao, Zhen-Gang (2); Li, Ying-Na (2); Li, Chuan (2); Peng, Qing-Jun (3); Liang, Shi-Bin (3); Chen, Xian-Fu (3); Wang, Da-Da (4) ","(1) Postdoctoral Workstation of Yunnan Power Grid Corporation, Kunming, China (2) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China (3) Electric Power Research Institute of Yunnan Electric Power Test and Research Institute Group Limited, Kunming, China (4) Yunnan Power Grid Corporation Training Center, Kunming, China ",,408.2 Structural Members and Shapes - 422 Strength of Building Materials; Test Equipment and Methods - 481.1 Geology - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 701 Electricity and Magnetism,140979.0,"September 24, 2014 - September 26, 2014","Nanjing, China","2nd International Conference of Structural Health Monitoring and Integrity Management, ICSHMIM 2014",Electromagnetic pulse - Fiber Bragg gratings - Geology - Landforms - Landslides - Locks (fasteners) - Structural health monitoring - Subsidence,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781138027763.0,,,2015,English,Piles,"Structural Health Monitoring and Integrity Management - Proceeding of the 2nd International Conference of Structural Health Monitoring and Integrity Management, ICSHMIM 2014",14.0,379-384,1 of 1,2015,CRC Press/Balkema,"Structural Health Monitoring and Integrity Management - Proceeding of the 2nd International Conference of Structural Health Monitoring and Integrity Management, ICSHMIM 2014",,On the application of Fiber Bragg grating strain piles for monitoring the slope of mountain substations,,Center wavelength - FBG strain sensors - Geological disaster - Geological structures - Maximum strains - Monitoring results - Stability of slopes - Stability of the slopes,,
Chem. Eng. Res.

The stoichiometry of the complex formation reaction between La and H2A2has been evaluated. The extraction kinetics data have been analyzed in terms of pseudo-first order constants. From the effects of stirring speed, temperature and specific interfacial area on the extraction rate, it is found that the extraction process is a diffusion-controlled kinetics process with an interface reaction.

J. Sep. Sci.,"This study was conducted to investigate the chemical differences between Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma and Acori Calami Rhizoma using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry and chemometric methods. Quantitative fingerprints were established. A total of 90 volatile compounds were identified and quantified using heuristic evolving latent projection and retention index. An efficient model based on partial least squares-discriminant analysis coupled with variable iterative space shrinkage approach was developed to distinguish Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma from Acori Calami Rhizoma. The correct rate was 95.83%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 100%. Finally, three volatiles, namely, camphor, longicyclene, and δ-cadinene, were selected as key discrimination factors between Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma and Acori Calami Rhizoma.

Acta Geophys. Sin.,"The object of this paper is to compare the relocation results between the catalog data and the cross-correlation data of the Yiliang earthquake sequence occurred in September 2011, then discuss the impact on the location of different velocity models and confirm the seismogenic fault structures. We adopted double difference algorithm for earthquake hypocenter relocation by using catalog data and cross-correlation data respectively. We proposed the time domain multi-channel correlation detection function and used it to calculate waveform cross-correlation travel time difference data. In general, the number of the waveform cross-correlation data is less than the catalog data, so the number of relocation earthquakes is small. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we used the catalog data to supplement the waveform cross-correlation data and set the weight of catalog data less than the waveform cross-correlation data. To ensure that the relocation results were stable and reliable, we used multiple criteria to filter the travel time difference data. The proportion of two kinds of data was about 17.5:1 in our cross-correlation data used in relocation. In order to find the most suitable velocity model for the regional crust structure and ensure the relocation results were reliable, we used four velocity models and chose the best results. Among the 944 ML≥1.0 earthquakes of Yiliang earthquake sequence from September 7 to October 7, 2012, we obtained 652 relocation events. The location of MS5.7 main earthquake was 27.516°N, 103.951°E, and 6.9 km in the depth. The location of MS5.6 main earthquake was 27.543°N, 104.023°E, and 7.27 km in the depth. The Yiliang earthquake sequence was located between Zhaotong-Ludian fault and Yiliang-Huize fault which were both NE trending, and the two main earthquakes occurred at opposite ends of the sequence. Relocation results show that the earthquake sequence was more concentrated along the nearby fault, the seismic strip extended for less than 20 km, the depth distribution became shallower than before and was mainly located between 5 km and 8 km depth and the cluster was slightly tilted. The average relative errors of east-west direction, south-north direction, depth and origin time ware 55.2 m, 43.0 m, 186.7 m and 0.01 s, the travel time residual was 16 ms. We used bootstrap method to evaluate the location errors and the correlations of the four source parameters. The results show that the location errors of the results of cross-correlation data were smaller than catalog data and the location accuracy was more than an order of magnitude higher compared to catalog locations. The cross-correlation data can also reduce the correlations of the source parameters. The location results of different velocity models show that there were significant correlations between focal depth and velocity model and we should choose the velocity model carefully. Based on the distribution of the earthquake sequence and regional modern tectonic stress field, we confirmed that Yiliang-Huize fault was the seismogenic structure of Yiliang earthquake sequence. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue,"Rural sewage treatment is an important task of the New Rural Construction in China, which also plays a key role in improving the rural ecological environment. In this study, using system dynamic (SD) model and Powell optimization model, a SD-Powell coupled model with simulation and optimization function was set up to simulate and predict the amount of pollutant discharge, and to establish the functional relationship of pollutant reduction and cost. Taking Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province as a case study, the calculated results indicate that COD and ammonia emissions will reach up to 16583 t and 2551 t in 2020 respectively, increased by 4.60% and 4.59% compared to 2008.The 51 towns in Changzhou City were divided into four categories of control units using clustering method. The treatment cost functions for COD and ammonia in different control units were obtained, with the treatment cost in four units varying from 348 kg to 413 kg per ten thousand Yuan RMB for COD, and 54 kg to 65 kg per ten thousand Yuan RMB for ammonia. The total cost will be 168.7 million RMB Yuan if the pollutant reduction rate in the whole area reaches 100%. The results show that the pollutant reduction rate by cost optimization was better than the cost average allocation. Compared to average allocation results, the method used in this study could increase reduction effectiveness of the two pollutants COD and ammonia by 6.4% and 7.4%, respectively. The optimal treatment cost was between 10and 168.7 million RMB per year under different reduction rates and the treatment cost for priority unit was in the order of I>IV>II >III. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences.

Wood Res.,"In this paper, the effects of dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment at atmospheric pressure on wettability, aging behavior and adhesion properties on a Yunnan pine wood surface were investigated. Contact angle, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy measurements were used to study the changes of surface energy and chemical elements in the wood surface due to dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatments. An increase in the surface energy, in the proportion of-OH, -CO and-COOH functional groups and in the shear bond strength of wood bonded with Urea-formaldehyde, Melamine-formaldehyde and Melamine-Urea-formaldehyde adhesives after plasma treatment were observed. The results indicated that the wood surface hydrophilic character, wettability and adhesion properties were improved.

Int. J. Heat Mass Transf.,"This work is concerned with the size effects of Ag nanowires on thermal conductivity and rheological behavior of EG-based suspensions. The influences of inclusion concentration and temperature on the thermophysical properties of specimens containing three types of Ag nanowires were also investigated. It was shown that the measured thermal conductivity of EG-based suspensions increased with the rising temperature and loading. Besides, the relative enhancement in thermal conductivity exhibited a linear relationship with respect to the specific surface area of Ag nanowires. A theoretical approach was developed to predict the effective thermal conductivity of suspensions containing nanowires by introducing liquid layer into account. The Ag nanowires/EG interface thermal resistances were extracted from the experimental results, which ranged from 2.0 × 108to 5 × 108m2K/W. Furthermore, a comparative study revealed the excellent performance of Ag nanowires used in present work on improving thermal conductivity compared with the reported studies. Finally, the presence of Ag nanowires with the highest aspect ratio (250) was concluded as the main explanation of a noticeable rise in dynamic viscosity and non-Brownian fluid behavior of EG-based suspensions at the highest loading (10 mg/mL). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20144700224742,,"Fang, Xin (1, 2); Ding, Qing (1); Fan, Li-Wu (1); Lu, Hai (3, 4); Yu, Zi-Tao (1) ","(1) Institute of Thermal Science and Power Systems, School of Energy Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang; 310027, China (2) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta; GA; 30332, United States (3) Electric Power Research Institute, Yunnan Electric Power and Research Institute (Group), Kunming, Yunnan; 650217, China (4) Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Brinellvägen 23, Stockholm; 10044, Sweden ",IJHMAK,547.1 Precious Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.1 Mechanics - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Aspect ratio - Ethylene - Ethylene glycol - Nanowires - Rheology - Silver - Specific surface area - Thermal conductivity - Thermodynamic properties,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yu, Zi-Tao ",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2014.10.043,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,00179310,,February 2015,English,Thermal conductivity of liquids,,38.0,554-562,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,,Effects of inclusion size on thermal conductivity and rheological behavior of ethylene glycol-based suspensions containing silver nanowires with various specific surface areas,,Ag nanowires - Dynamic viscosities - Effective thermal conductivity - Interface thermal resistance - Linear relationships - Rheological behaviors - Rising temperatures - Theoretical approach,81,
IEEE Trans Dielectr Electr Insul,"Estimation of the degree of aging and the remaining lifetime of composite insulators is an important issue. In this paper, one shed of a 500 kV AC composite insulator that has operated for three years on a transmission line was studied. The insulator shed was cut longitudinally into four layers from the upper surface to the bottom surface and tested by the thermally stimulated current (TSC) method, and each layer was also tested by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results show that the first layer has fewer trap charges than the other layers in the TSC test, but it also has the highest trap level, and the trap depth of the first layer is deeper than that of the other layers. The trap levels and the quantities of shallow traps decrease successively from the second to the fourth layer.

Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue,"In the process of ecological restoration using submerged vegetation, green filamentous algae Cladophora will be blooming with decreased nutrients and increased water transparency. To determine the effects of light intensity and phosphorus concentration on growth of C. oligoclona, the growth and photosynthetic activity of C. oligoclona cultured in BBM medium at different concentrations of phosphorus (0.005, 0.02, 0.1, 0.6 mg/L) and light intensities [10, 30, 50 μmol/(m2·s)] for 16 days was examined. The results showed that at the light intensity of 10 μmol/(m2·s), the fresh weight of C. oligoclona increased by about 0.05 g at the phosphorus concentrations of 0.1 mg/L or above. However, the fresh weight of C. oligoclona decreased under other conditions. The greatest fresh weight loss was observed (about 0.49 g) at the highest light intensity of 50 μmol/(m2·s) and the lowest phosphorus concentration of 0.005 mg/L. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters Fv/Fm values inversely related to light intensity, the value of Fv/Fm decreased as the light intensity increased. Fv/Fm value was 0.75 at 10 μmol/(m2·s) whereas Fv/Fm value was only 0.3 at 50 μmol/(m2·s). Under the same light intensity, the different concentrations of phosphorus had no significant effects on the Fv/Fm values. These data showed that light intensity exerted more effects on the growth of C. oligoclona than phosphorus concentration. However, higher light intensity was detrimental to the growth of C. oligoclona. ©, 2015, Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science.

Anal. Chem.,"Fluorescent probe 1, the first inorganic phosphate (Pi) targeted colorimetric and fluorescent probe to detect endogenous Pi in hemichannel-closed cells, has been developed. Probe 1 undergoes a unique Pi induced hydrolytic reaction in DMSO-HEPES (V/V = 9:1) buffered (0.02 M, pH 7.4) solutions that produces a colorimetric change associated with a 62 nm red-shift in the UV-vis absorption maximum and up to a 780-fold enhancement in the fluorescence intensity. The mechanistic proposal that these spectroscopic changes are associated with reaction Pi with 1 to form coumarin gains support from the results of theoretical calculations and mass spectrometry studies. Observations made in fluorescence imaging studies with HeLa cells and C. elegans show that 1 can be employed to monitor Pi production in vivo caused by apyrase-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, probe 1 was utilized to show that apoptosis of hemichannel-closed Sf9 cells is caused by Inx3 promoted dephosphorylation of Akt (RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase), leading to an elevation of the concentration of Pi. Overall, the study has produced the first fluorescent sensor 1 for endogenous inorganic phosphate. Moreover, the utility of 1 for measuring Pi release in vitro has been demonstrated and utilized to elucidate the mechanism of Inx3 action in hemichannel-closed Sf9 cells. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,,20150700515015,,"Guo, Lin E.

In building dimensional sentiment applications, affective lexicons with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but are still very rare. Therefore, this study proposes a weighted graph model that considers both the relations of multiple nodes and their similarities as weights to automatically determine the VA ratings of affective words. Experiments on both English and Chinese affective lexicons show that the proposed method yielded a smaller error rate on VA prediction than the linear regression, kernel method, and pagerank algorithm used in previous studies. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,,20154201394877,,"Yu, Liang-Chih (1, 3); Wang, Jin (2, 3, 4); Lai, K.

J. Sep. Sci.,"Metal-organic frameworks are promising porous materials. Chiral metal-organic frameworks have attracted considerable attention in controlling enantioselectivity. In this study, a homochiral metal-organic framework [Co2(D-cam)2(TMDPy)] (D-cam = d-camphorates, TMDPy = 4,4′-trimethylenedipyridine) with a non-interpenetrating primitive cubic net has been used as a chiral stationary phase in high-performance liquid chromatography. It has allowed the successful separation of six positional isomers and six chiral compounds. The good selectivity and baseline separation, or at least 60% valley separation, confirmed its excellent molecular recognition characteristics. The relative standard deviations for the retention time of run-to-run and column-to-column were less than 1.8 and 3.1%, respectively. These results demonstrate that [Co2(D-cam)2(TMDPy)] may represent a promising chiral stationary phase for use in high-performance liquid chromatography. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

J Phys Chem B,"Whereas many membrane-destabilization modes have been suggested for membrane-spanning antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), few are available for those too short to span membrane thickness. Here we show that ORB-1, a 15-residue disulfide-bridged AMP that is only ∼20 Å long even when fully stretched like a hairpin, may act by inducing small anion-selective transmembrane 'holes' of negative mean curvature. In model membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, ORB-1 induces chloride transmembrane transport and formation of transmembrane channels of negative mean curvature, whereas the inactive analogue, ORB-N, does not, suggesting a correlation between antibacterial activity and ability to induce transmembrane channels. Given that ORB-N is the C-terminus amidated form of ORB-1, our results further suggest that formation of membrane-spanning dimers may be required to initiate the observed channel induction. Moreover, ORB-1 renders model bacterial membranes permeable to anions with effective hydration diameters of -and NO3-), but not cations of similar sizes (e.g., H3O+), indicative of anion-selective transmembrane channels with an effective inner diameter of ≤1 nm. In addition, negative-intrinsic-curvature (NIC) lipids such as phosphoethanolamine (PE) may facilitate the membrane-destabilization process of ORB-1. Our findings may expand current understandings on how AMPs destabilize membranes and facilitate the pharmaceutical development of ORB-1. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20152901034063,,"Hu, Kan (1, 2); Jiang, Yunjiang (1, 2, 6); Xie, Yuntao (1, 2); Liu, Hui (1, 2); Liu, Rui (5); Zhao, Zhi (3); Lai, Ren (5); Yang, Lihua (2, 4) ","(1) CAS Key Laboratory of Materials for Energy Conversion, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; Anhui; 230026, China (2) Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; Anhui; 230026, China (3) Hefei National Laboratory on Physics on Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; Anhui; 230026, China (4) Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; Anhui; 230026, China (5) Biotoxin Units of Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; Yunnan; 650223, China (6) Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Colorado School of Mines, 1500 Illinois Street, Golden; CO; 80401, United States ",JPCBFK,461.9 Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Bacteria - Chlorine compounds - Negative ions - Peptides - Polypeptides - Sulfur compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lai, Ren(rlai@mail.kiz.ac.cn) ",10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b03133,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205207,,,,15206106,27,"July 9, 2015",English,Membranes,,68.0,8553-8560,,2015,American Chemical Society,Journal of Physical Chemistry B,,Small-Anion Selective Transmembrane 'holes' Induced by an Antimicrobial Peptide Too Short to Span Membranes,,Anti-bacterial activity - Antimicrobial peptide - Gram-negative bacteria - Membrane destabilization - Pharmaceutical development - Phosphoethanolamine - Transmembrane channels - Transmembrane transport,119,

However, the restarting of DC converter station needs to meet certain constraints. Thus, the optimal recovery path of the DC converter station is studied in this paper. The objective is to minimize the restoration time of the DC converter station, with constraints of starting DC converter station, traditional generators that are reactive power, self-excitation and start power, and power flow constraints of the grid considered.

Guangxue Xuebao,"Fe60 alloy coating is fabricated on 45 steel surfaces using mechanical vibration assisted synchronous powder feeding laser cladding process. The microstructure of Fe-based cladding coating and bonding interface, phase composition, element distribution characteristic and diffusion behavior at the interface are investigated by optical microscope (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), respectively. The results show that the bonding interface are complete to cellular dendritic crystal growth, the main phases are composed of (Fe, Cr) solid solution and a small amount of (Fe, Cr)7C3, Fe2B and Fe0.9Si0.1compound. Mechanical vibration energy causes dendrite Fe0.9Si0.1discrete from dendrite internal to interdendrite, and a large amount of (Fe, Cr) solid solution remains in the dendrite internal. Higher mechanical vibration energy leads to better element diffusion in laser molten pool. Meanwhile, the effect of vibration amplitude and frequency on the elements distribution and grain refining at the bonding interface front are also different. Increase the frequency is beneficial to the directional dendrite growth and increase the amplitude is beneficial to the dendritic dispersed distribution at the bonding interface front 40 μm scope.

Fire Mater,"Hydroquinone bis(diphenyl phosphate) (HDP) has been adopted to prepare acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS)/HDP/novolac phenol (NP) composites. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) of ABS/HDP/NP composites is tested in this paper. The LOI value first grows with increasing ratio of HDP to NP, after reaching its maximum it decrease with further increasing ratio. The synergistic effect of HDP and NP exerted on the microstructure and the flame retardancy of ABS/HDP/NP composites are carefully analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), cone calorimeter (CCT), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results of CCT show that the synergistic action of HDP and NP reduces its heat release rate and smoke production rate. The results of TGA and SEM demonstrated that the introduction of NP and HDP is conducive to the improvement of the thermal stability and the formation of the intumescent char with homogeneous cavities and holes. The EDS results indicate that the introduction of NP could help retain phosphorus in the chars. As a result, the synergistic action of HDP and NP is favorable to the enhancement of flame retardancy of ABS/HDP/NP composites.

J. Biosci. Bioeng.,"An exo-inulinase gene was cloned from Arthrobacter sp. MN8, a cold-adapted bacterium isolated from lead-zinc-rich soil. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The resultant 505-residue polypeptide (InuAMN8) showed the highest identity (81.1%) with the putative levanase from Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans Sphe3 (ADX73279) and shared 57.8% identity with the exo-inulinase from Bacillus sp. snu-7 (AAK00768). The purified recombinant InuAMN8 (rInuAMN8) showed an apparently optimal activity at 35°C, and 75.3%, 39.4%, and 15.8% of its maximum activity at 20°C, 10°C, and 0°C, respectively. After pre-incubation for 60min at 50°C and 55°C, the rInuAMN8 exhibited 69.8% and 17.7% of its initial activity, respectively. The apparent Kmvalues of rInuAMN8 towards inulin were 2.8, 1.5, 1.2, 5.3, and 8.2mM at 0°C, 10°C, 20°C, 30°C, and 35°C, respectively. Inulin and Jerusalem artichoke tubers were effectively hydrolyzed to release fructose by rInuAMN8 at 0°C, 10°C, and 35°C. Compared with its hyperthermophilic and thermophilic counterparts, the exo-inulinase had less aromatic amino acid F and more hydrophobic amino acid A. In addition, the purified rInuAMN8 retained 127.9%-88.4% inulinase activity at 3.5%-15.0% (w/v) NaCl concentrations. Zn2+and Pb2+at 10mM exhibited little or no effect on the enzyme activity. This paper is the first to report a cold-active and/or NaCl-tolerant exo-inulinase from the genus Arthrobacter. The exo-inulinase rInuAMN8 shows a potential for use in the production of fructose at low temperatures. © 2014 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.",,,20150800540008,,"Zhou, Junpei (1, 2, 3); Lu, Qian (2); Peng, Mozhen (2); Zhang, Rui (1, 2, 3); Mo, Minghe (4); Tang, Xianghua (1, 2, 3); Li, Junjun (1, 2, 3); Xu, Bo (1, 2, 3); Ding, Junmei (1, 2, 3); Huang, Zunxi (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Sustainable Development and Utilization of Biomass Energy, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) College of Life Sciences, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (3) Key Laboratory of Yunnan for Biomass Energy and Biotechnology of Environment, Yunnan Kunming; 650500, China (4) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources of the Ministry of Education, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",JBBIF6,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Amino acids - Bacteriology - Cloning - Escherichia coli - Fructose - Genes - Lead compounds - Polysaccharides - Purification - Sodium chloride - Zinc compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Zunxi(huangzunxi@163.com) ",10.1016/j.jbiosc.2014.08.003,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),13474421,"Number: 2013Y432, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013BAD10B01, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2013FZ045, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 31160229, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the Key Technologies Research and Development Program of China (No. 2013BAD10B01 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31160229 ), Applied and Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (No. 2013FZ045 ), and Science Research Foundation of Yunnan Provincial Education Committee (No. 2013Y432 ).",,13891723,3,"March 1, 2015",English,Enzyme activity,,43.0,267-274,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering,,Cold-active and NaCl-tolerant exo-inulinase from a cold-adapted Arthrobacter sp.

J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol.,"An appropriate interaction between implanted materials and the surrounding tissue is essential for successful implantation. Titanium (Ti) and some of its alloys have been used in dentistry and orthopedics as a substitutive material for hard tissue, such as teeth or natural bone. Nevertheless, metal ions released from titanium and alloy implants have adverse biological effects on biological tissues or cells. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) promotes cell migration, proliferation and wound healing. FAK and ERK1/2 signaling regulate cell adhesion and proliferation for cell survival. This study evaluated the potential of SLPI as a molecule to increase the cell adhesion on the Ti surface. Compared with the untreated cells, SLPI increased the adhesion of MC3T3-E1 cells to Ti discs, formation of actin stress fibers, paxillin expression and the phosphorylation of FAK. Moreover, SLPI enhanced the level of Grb2 and Ras expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the MC3T3-E1 cells on Ti discs. These results suggest that SLPI can increase the interaction between the implanted Ti material and surrounding bone in orthodontic and dental surgery, making an effective nanomolecule for successful implantation.

Binggong Xuebao,"The electron multiplication gain needs to be corrected during operation of the EMCCD camera. According to the structural characteristics of the electron multiplying CCD and the charge multiplication of the single stage multiplier, the limitation of the existing multiplication model has to be analyzed in practical application. For TI EMCCD devices, the key parameters, including the operation voltage and temperature of EMCCD, of original multiplication model can be derived by simulation, a mathematical equation of the parameters is also presented by multiple regression analysis. And then the equation is introduced into the model, and a new method for determining the EMCCD gain is obtained, which is universal and simpler. It expands the application range of the original multiplication model. The simulation results of the model agree well with the actual data of EMCCD device. It shows that, the gain model is convenient for calculating the electron multiplier average gain as the charge multiplication gate voltage is changed. ©, 2015, China Ordnance Society.

Tiedao Xuebao,"Based on Terzaghi-Rendulic two-dimensional consolidation theory, soil is regarded as saturated elastic medium. With the semi infinite space area that contains circular ring(tunnel) being mapped to a circular ring region using conformal mapping method, the control equation for dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the soil around the tunnel was established in the case of impermeable lining. The method of separation of variables was applied to solve the control equation, to obtain the analytical solution for dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the soil around the tunnel that is situated in saturated elastic soil. Combined with the calculation, an analysis was performed on the time-varying excess pore water pressure at the top of tunnel and horizontal level under different depth of tunnel, as well as on the change law of excess pore water pressure in the soil above the tunnel. The results showed that the deeper the tunnel was, the slower the dissipating speed of excess pore water pressure in the surrounding soil. The dissipating speed of excess pore water pressure was faster at the beginning, while it became slower gradually with the passage of time. The dissipating speed of horizontal excess pore water pressure in the soil around the tunnel was faster than that of verticle excess pore water pressure. The closer the soil above the tunnel is to the tunnel, the faster the dissipating speed of excess pore water pressure. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi,"In the present paper, the authors studied fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) phenomenon between silver triangular nanoplates and bovine serum albumin (BSA)/Rhodamine 6G fluorescence complex, and established a fluorescence method for the detection of cobalt ions. We found that when increasing the silver triangular nanoplates added to certain concentrations of fluorescent bovine serum albumin (BSA) /Rhodamine 6G complex, the fluorescence of Rhodamine 6G would be quenched up to 80% due to the FRET between the quencher and donor. However, in the presence of cobalt ions, the disassociation of the fluorescent complex from silver triangular nanoplates occurred and the fluorescence of the Rhodamine 6G recovered. The recovery of fluorescence intensity rate (I/I0) has a good relationship with the cobalt ion concentration (cCO2+) added. Thus, the authors developed a fluorescence method for the detection of cobalt ions based on the FRET of silver triangular nanoplates and Rhodamine 6G. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao,"The button contact resistance measurement is difficult under dynamic conditions due to large external high frequency noise and Gaussian white noise under industrial environment, the harmonic analysis method and AC comparison method are investigated, which are applied to the button dynamic measurement instrument. The AC comparison method can effectively improve the signal to noise ratio and eliminate zero drift and temperature drift. The harmonic analysis is used to process the resistance value, which can filter quantization noise generated by A/D, and reduce the measurement interference because of high-frequency noise and Gaussian white noise.

Moreover, we investigate numerically the behavior of the model on a real scale-free social site with the exponent γ=1.08. We find that weak ties between nodes play an important role in information dissemination process.

Guangxue Xuebao,"To obtain the blue light emitting materials which exhibit high emission efficiency, good balanced electron and hole injection and good hole transport ability, a set of firefly enol-form oxyluciferin analogs with pyrrole, thiophene, furan, imidazole, oxazole instead of thiazole ring in benzothiazole fragment of enol-form oxyluciferin is designed. A systematic investigation into them is carried out with the density functional theory and timedependent density functional theory. The calculated ionization potentials show that introducing pyrrole, thiophene, furan and imidazole can largely enhance the hole transport ability. By analyzing the hole and electron reorganization energies, it is found that the balance between the hole-transfer and electron-transfer is good. Five novel firefly enol-form oxyluciferin analogues in which the benzothiazole ring is replaced with indole (EIN), benzothiophene (ETH), benzofuran (EFU), benzimidazole (EIM) and benzoxazole (EOX) can all be used as blue light-emitting materials. ©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

"Int. Conf. Serv. Syst. Serv. Manag., ICSSSM","Face recognition presents the difficulty of occlusion. The occlusion is generally endowed a little weight to weaken its influence on recognition performance. On the basis of this idea, many existing algorithms used the reconstruction error or projection error as the probability estimation for occlusion image. These methods require iterative computation, which may lead to the difficulty of threshold selection and high time complexity. To solve these problems, this paper proposed a novel method for occlusion face recognition by using an error detection method. First, a face image is divided into four regions and we extract feature and detect error for each region. Second, we use the logarithmic transform error operator to calculate the weight value of each region. The experiments based on the AR database demonstrate that the proposed algorithm for occlusion face recognition achieves high efficiency and good robustness and outperforms the existing methods for certain occlusion recognition. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20154801624846,7170323,"Chen, Xiaolin (1); Wang, Shunfang (1); Liu, Weibo (2) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,723.5 Computer Applications - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,115762.0,"June 22, 2015 - June 24, 2015","Guangzhou, China","12th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management, ICSSSM 2015",Computer graphics - Error detection - Iterative methods - Principal component analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Shunfang(wangsf_66@hotmail.com) ",10.1109/ICSSSM.2015.7170323,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479983285.0,,,"July 28, 2015",English,Face recognition,"2015 12th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management, ICSSSM 2015",12.0,,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2015 12th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management, ICSSSM 2015",,Face recognition based on error detection under partial occlusion,,Detection methods - Iterative computation - Logarithmic transforms - Partial occlusions - Probability estimation - Reconstruction error - Threshold selection - Weight values,,

J Mater Sci,"Poly(lactic acid)/poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PLA/PTMC) films incorporated with cinnamaldehyde (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 wt%) were prepared by solvent casting and characterized by physical, mechanical, and antimicrobial properties. SEM analysis revealed that the surface of film became rougher with certain porosity when cinnamaldehyde was incorporated into the PLA/PTMC blends. Cinnamaldehyde acted as plasticizers which reduce the intermolecular forces of polymer chains, thus improving the flexibility and extensibility of the films. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the crystallinity of PLA phase decreased by the presence of cinnamaldehyde in the composite films. Water vapor permeability of films increased with the increase of cinnamaldehyde loading. However, the active PLA/PTMC/cinnamaldehyde composite films showed adequate barrier properties for food packaging application. Incorporation of cinnamaldehyde to the PLA/PTMC polymer matrix improved the antimicrobial activity of active packaging films. These results indicated that the best compromise between mechanical, barrier, thermal, and antimicrobial properties could be achieved by the addition of 9 wt% cinnamaldehyde into PLA/PTMC blends. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20144700226090,,"Qin, Yuyue (1); Yang, Jiyi (1); Xue, Jing (2) ","(1) Institute of Yunnan Food Safety, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650550, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu; 610041, China ",JMTSAS,461.9 Biology - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1 Polymeric Materials - 944.6 Temperature Measurements,,,,,Chemical bonds - Differential scanning calorimetry - Lactic acid - Microorganisms - Polymer films - Solvents,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Qin, Yuyue ",10.1007/s10853-014-8671-8,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15734803,,,,00222461,3,2015,English,Composite films,,40.0,1150-1158,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Journal of Materials Science,,Characterization of antimicrobial poly(lactic acid)/poly(trimethylene carbonate) films with cinnamaldehyde,,Active packaging - Anti-microbial activity - Anti-microbial properties - Barrier properties - Inter-molecular forces - Poly lactic acid - Trimethylene carbonate - Water vapor permeability,50,
Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"Both aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) and nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) bacteria can play an important role in mitigating the methane emission produced in anoxic sediment layers to the atmosphere. However, the environmental factors regulating the distribution of these methane-oxidizing microorganisms in lacustrine ecosystems remain essentially unclear. The present study investigated the distribution of aerobic MOB and n-damo bacteria in sediments of various freshwater lakes on the Yunnan Plateau (China). Quantitative PCR assay and clone library analysis illustrated the spatial variations in the abundances and structures of aerobic MOB and n-damo bacterial communities. Type I MOB (Methylosoma and Methylobacter) and type II MOB (Methylocystis) were detected, while type I MOB was more abundant than type II MOB. Lake sediments n-damo bacterial communities were composed of novel Methylomirabilis oxyfera-like pmoA genes. Lake sediments in the same geographic region could share a relatively similar aerobic MOB community structure. Moreover, Pearson’s correlation analysis indicated that n-damo pmoA gene diversity showed a positive correlation with the ratio of organic matter to total nitrogen in lake sediment. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,20144400138849,,"Liu, Yong (1); Zhang, Jingxu (2); Zhao, Lei (3); Li, Yuzhao (1); Yang, Yuyin (2); Xie, Shuguang (2) ","(1) Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences (Ministry of Education), College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (2) State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing; 100871, China (3) Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pollution Process and Management of Plateau Lake-Watershed, Kunming; 650034, China ",AMBIDG,461 Bioengineering and Biology - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 483 Soil Mechanics and Foundations - 801.2 Biochemistry - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Aerobic bacteria - Genes - Lakes - Methane - Oxic sediments - Polymerase chain reaction - Sediments - Water,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Xie, Shuguang ",10.1007/s00253-014-6141-5,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),14320614,,,,01757598,5,"February 19, 2015",English,Anoxic sediments,,42.0,2371-2381,,2015,Springer Verlag,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,,Aerobic and nitrite-dependent methane-oxidizing microorganisms in sediments of freshwater lakes on the Yunnan Plateau,,Anaerobic methane oxidations - Anoxic sediment layer - Environmental factors - High Latitudes - Lacustrine ecosystems - Methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB) - Methane oxidizing bacterium - Positive correlations,99,
"Int. Conf. Control, Autom. Inf. Sci., ICCAIS","The nominal linear subsystem state-space model having nonlinear couplings are used in this work. The quadratic dissipativity constraint approach, previously introduced and developed for the model predictive control of interconnected systems, is deployed herein with a static state-feedback strategy. We re-use the derivation for a quadratic bound on the nonlinear coupling in a newly derived stability condition for the decentralized excitation control of multiple-machine power systems. The state feedback gains are pre-computed from the LMI optimization problems formulated from this stability condition in combination with the open-loop dissipative condition for the global system and the closed-loop dissipative condition for subsystems. Inheriting the property of the non-monotonic decreasing Lyapunov function, the proposed decentralized static state-feedback approach is promising with non-conservative behaviours. The resulting static state-feedback gain can be used in the feedback policy for a distributed model predictive control scheme, when it is required to push the system towards tighter constraints for various economic objectives. © 2014 IEEE.",,,20150900577581,7020563,"Tran, Tri (1) ","(1) Cambridge Centre for Advanced Research in Energy Efficiency in Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Yunnan Garden Campus, Singapore, Singapore ",,731.1 Control Systems - 921 Mathematics - 961 Systems Science,110276.0,"December 2, 2014 - December 5, 2014","Gwangju, Korea, Republic of","3rd International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences, ICCAIS 2014",Feedback control - Lyapunov functions - Model predictive control - State feedback - State space methods,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Tran, Tri(tcTran@ieee.org) ",10.1109/ICCAIS.2014.7020563,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479972043.0,,,"January 23, 2014",English,System stability,,23.0,30-35,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2014 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences, ICCAIS 2014",BK21 Plus; Global Frontier Project - Center for Integrated Smart Sensors; ICT R and D DeepView Project,State feedback control of explicitly-bounded nonlinearly-coupled interconnected systems,,Decentralized excitation controls - Dissipative condition - Distributed Model predictive Control - Nonlinearly coupled - Stability condition - State - space models - State feedback gain - Static state feedback,,

Mater. Sci. Forum,"This work investigates the removal of B in Si by the addition of Zr in the electromagnetic solidification refinement of silicon-aluminum melts. As Zr has a strong affinity for B and can form the thermodynamically stable compound of ZrB2, the B content of lower-grade Si is expected to be effectively removed by adding a small amount of Zr to the Si-55 at% Al melt. The results show that Zr is strongly responsible for the decrease in B content of refined Si. The removal fraction of B significantly increased from 60.2% to 97.3% by adding a small amount of Zr (0 to 3500 ppmw). In addition, the removal fraction of Zr from Si was found to be as high as 98.6%; however, its residual content in the refined Si was significantly larger than its solid solubility in Si, possibly due to the non-equilibrium solidification occurring during the refining process. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",,,20160201796495,,"Lei, Yun (1, 2); Ma, Wen Hui (1, 2); Wei, Kui Xian (1, 2); Wu, Ji Jun (1, 2); Lv, Guo Qiang (1, 2); Dai, Yong Nian (1, 2); Morita, Kazuki (3) ","(1) National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) Key Laboratory for Nonferrous Vacuum Metallurgy of Yunnan Province, Engineering Research Center for Silicon Metallurgy and Silicon Materials of Yunnan Provincial Universities, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Department of Materials Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku; Tokyo; 113-8656, Japan ",MSFOEP,549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical Operations,156589.0,"November 30, 2014 - December 3, 2014","Xiamen, China","9th International Forum on Advanced Material Science and Technology, IFAMST9 2014",Aluminum compounds - Boron - Refining - Silicon - Solidification - Zirconium - Zirconium compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.833.97,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9783038355960.0,02555476,,2015,English,Boron compounds,Applied Materials and Technologies,10.0,97-100,1 of 1,2015,Trans Tech Publications Ltd,Materials Science Forum,,Effect of zirconium on boron removal in electromagnetic solidification refinement of silicon from Si-Al melt,,Boron removal - Non-equilibrium solidification - Residual content - Si-Al melt - Silicon-aluminum melt - Solid solubilities - Thermodynamically stable - ZrB2,833,

By reconstructing the system equation, the time-varying delay is combined into an unknown periodic time-varying vector which is estimated by a periodic adaptive mechanism. The proposed control scheme includes a differential-difference mixed-type adaptive law used to estimate the unknown time-varying parameters and an adaptive repetitive learning control.

"Sens Actuators, B Chem","A chemosensor 3-[(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-amino]-1H-pyridin-2-one (HL) for multi-ions was synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. HL is a turn-on fluorescence chemosensor for Al3+, F-, and CN-ions in DMSO. F-and CN-anions could be further distinguished by the ratiometric absorption spectrometry method. Job plot and1H NMR data showed that the binding stoichiometries of HL with Al3+, F-, or CN-all were 1:1. Further observations of1H NMR titration and ESI-MS showed that the possible fluorescent species of Al3+with HL was [AlL(OH)(DMSO)2]+in DMSO. The spectroscopic observations of the Al(III) complex showed that the two oxygen atoms and one imine nitrogen atom of HL were coordinated to the Al(III) ion. While the crystal structure of the Ni(II)-L complex confirmed the tridentate coordination mode of HL in the complexes. The experimental results revealed that HL and F-ion formed hydrogen bond in DMSO, while CN-attacked the carbon atom at -CN of HL to undergo a nucleophilic addition. The theoretical calculations confirmed that HL showed very weak fluorescence because of the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT).

"IEEE Int. Conf. Signal Process., Commun. Comput., ICSPCC","The single-phase grounding fault is the most common fault in the distribution network of resonant grounding. By analyzing the algorithm of arc suppression coil grounding, this paper presents a comprehensive selection algorithm based on mathematical morphology. The proposed algorithm carries out filters preprocessing of the line selection data by using two parallel composite structural elements morphological filters. Then, a method that combines morphological spectrum analysis and morphological peak and valley detection is applied to detect the fault. Results gained from verifying the algorithm by using MATLAB show that when a single-phase grounding fault occurs in the distribution network, this kind of algorithm is not affected by the system operation mode, time and distance of the fault, transition resistance, and the fault inception angle, which in turn proves that the algorithm has high anti-interference capability, adaptability and reliability. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161202131946,7338904,"Li, Ruowei (1); Liu, Zengli (1) ","(1) Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China ",,706.1.2 Electric Power Distribution - 716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 921 Mathematics,118377.0,"September 19, 2015 - September 22, 2015","Ningbo, Zhejiang, China","5th IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing, ICSPCC 2015",Electric power distribution - MATLAB - Signal processing - Spectrum analysis,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICSPCC.2015.7338904,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781479989188.0,,,"November 25, 2015",English,Mathematical morphology,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing, ICSPCC 2015",6.0,,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing, ICSPCC 2015",IEEE Hong Kong Section; IEEE Xi'an Section; Ningbo University; Northwestern Polytechnical University,Faulty line detection for distribution network based on mathematical morphology,,Anti-interference - Morphological filtering - Morphological spectrum - Single phase grounding - Valley detections,,

Geotecton. Metallog.,"The Jiudingshan granite complex in the western Yunnan province is located at the intersection of the NW trending Jinshajiang-Red River fault and NS trending Chenghai fault, where the South-East China diwa region joins western Yunnan diwa region. The complex consists of porphyritic granite, syenite porphyry, granite porphyry, alkali-feldspar granite porphyry and lamprophyre, occurring as stock, dike, dyke or sill. To constrain its petrogenesis, we carried out geochronological and geochemical studies on the Jiudingshan complex. The results show the syenite granite was formed at 34.6±0.7 Ma, which is consistent with the Eocene diwa stage and Cenozoic alkali-rich magmatic activity (45-30 Ma) in West Yunnan. The syenite porphyry contains SiO2>56%, K2O=3.38%-8.92%, ALK= 8.15%-11.15%, and MgO400×10-6), and low Y (-6) and Yb (-6) contents, which is the similar to those of the 'C-Type' adakite. The Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes indicate that the magma was resulted from crust-mantle (EMII-type) interaction. All the evidence listed above suggests that the left-slip shear extrusion of the Jinshajiang-Red River fault, promoted high felsic magma emplacement, as a result of the collision-subduction between India palte and Asia plate. ©, 2015, Science Press.

J. Exp. Nanosci.,"In this paper, we report that gold nanorods with different aspect ratios are controllably synthesised by a facile modified seed-mediated growth procedure. The growth rate of gold nanorods is lowered by adding H2SO4, and the yield of gold nanorods is improved. Increasing the concentration of AgNO3yields gold nanorods with different aspect ratios that differed from 1.83 to 5.04. To prevent aggregation of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped gold nanorods and investigate the sensitivity to the solution refractive index, surface modification is carried out. After assembling poly (sodium-p-styrensulfonate) onto the surface of gold nanorods, the samples can disperse well in water and dimethyl sulfoxide. The localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength of the as-prepared gold nanorods redshifts with increasing the refractive index of the solvent and a good linear relationship between LSPR peaks and refractive index is achieved. © 2013, Taylor & Francis.",,,20143600052137,,"Feng, Lili (1, 2, 3); Xuan, Zhenwen (1, 2); Ma, Jiebing (3); Chen, Jun (3); Cui, Daxiang (3); Su, Changwei (1, 2); Guo, Junming (1, 2); Zhang, Yingjie (1, 2) ","(1) Engineering Research Center of Biopolymer Functional Materials of Yunnan, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Key Laboratory of Ethnic Medicine Resource Chemistry, State Ethnic Affairs Commission & Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming; 650500, China (3) Research Institute of Micro/Nano Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai; 200240, China ",,547.1 Precious Metals - 741.1 Light/Optics - 761 Nanotechnology - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 933 Solid State Physics,,,,,Aspect ratio - Dimethyl sulfoxide - Gold - Nanorods - Plasmons - Surface plasmon resonance - Surface treatment,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Feng, Lili ",10.1080/17458080.2013.824619,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17458099,,,,17458080,4,"March 4, 2015",English,Refractive index,,24.0,258-267,,2015,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Journal of Experimental Nanoscience,,Preparation of gold nanorods with different aspect ratio and the optical response to solution refractive index,,Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide - Dielectric sensitivity - Gold nanorod - Linear relationships - Localised surface plasmon resonance - Optical response - Seed mediated growth - Synthesised,10,
Opt Eng,"An efficient multifocus image fusion scheme in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain is proposed. Based on the property of optical imaging and the theory of defocused image, we present a selection principle for lowpass frequency coefficients and also investigate the connection between a low-frequency image and the defocused image. Generally, the NSCT algorithm decomposes detail image information indwells in different scales and different directions in the bandpass subband coefficient. In order to correctly pick out the prefused bandpass directional coefficients, we introduce multiscale curvature, which not only inherits the advantages of windows with different sizes, but also correctly recognizes the focused pixels from source images, and then develop a new fusion scheme of the bandpass subband coefficients. The fused image can be obtained by inverse NSCT with the different fused coefficients. Several multifocus image fusion methods are compared with the proposed scheme. The experimental results clearly indicate the validity and superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of both the visual qualities and the quantitative evaluation. © 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",,,20153201116012,141900,"Li, Xiaosong (1); Li, Huafeng (1); Yu, Zhengtao (1); Kong, Yingchun (1) ","(1) Kunming University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Chenggong Campus, Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650500, China ",OPEGAR,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 741.1 Light/Optics,,,,,Image enhancement - Inverse problems - Optical properties,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Li, Huafeng ",10.1117/1.OE.54.7.073115,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15602303,,,,00913286,7,"July 1, 2015",English,Image fusion,,47.0,,,2015,SPIE,Optical Engineering,,Multifocus image fusion scheme based on the multiscale curvature in nonsubsampled contourlet transform domain,,defocused image - Frequency coefficient - Multi-scale curvatures - Multifocus image fusion - Non subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) - Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms - Quantitative evaluation - Subband coefficients,54,

Compared to conventional CPE and DLLME, the extraction patterns were changed and improved by the effect of ultrasound. As novel methods, their applications were expanded and the analytical performance of spectrophotometric determination for copper was considerably improved. The influence factors of UA-CPE and UA-DLLME were studied in detail. Under the optimal conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) for copper were 0.7 μg L-1of UA-CPE and 0.8 μg L-1of UA-DLLME with sensitivity enhancement factors (EFs) of 17 and 16. The developed methods were applied to the determination of trace copper in real water samples with satisfactory analytical results. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

RSC Adv.,"Pterostilbene (PS) is an effective antitumor drug, but its clinical development has been hampered due to its poor solubility and relatively short half-life. To deal with this predicament, an eight-arm-polyethylene glycol-PS (8arm-PEG-PS) prodrug was synthesized by linking PS with eight-arm-polyethylene glycol (8arm-PEG). The obtained 8arm-PEG-PS prodrug possesses high solubility (∼147 fold of free PS) and relatively high drug-binding capacity (∼7.06 wt%). An in vitro cytotoxicity test demonstrated the excellent anticancer activities with a potency similar to that of free PS. In addition, the PS prodrugs significantly improved the therapeutic effect on the inhibition of tumor growth with lower systemic toxicity compared to the native PS. Compared to the group treated by the free PS, the tumor volume of the groups treated by the PS prodrugs decreased dramatically by more than 2 fold or 3 fold in the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor-bearing mouse model. On the basis of these results, the 8arm-PEG-PS prodrugs have great promise toward cancer therapy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,20152500960093,,"Liu, Ke-Feng (1); Li, Chun-Xiao (1); Dai, Lin (1); Liu, Jing (1); Wang, Lu-Ying (1); Lei, Jian-Du (1); Guo, Li-Qun (2) ","(1) Beijing Key Laboratory of Lignocellulosic Chemistry, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing; 100083, China (2) Yunnan Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd, Kunming; 650106, China ",RSCACL,461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers,,,,,Polyethylene glycols - Polyethylenes - Solubility - Tumors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lei, Jian-Du ",10.1039/c5ra06253e,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),20462069,,,,,64,2015,English,Drug delivery,,41.0,51592-51599,,2015,Royal Society of Chemistry,RSC Advances,,"Design, synthesis and in vivo antitumor efficacy of novel eight-arm-polyethylene glycol-pterostilbene prodrugs",,Anti-tumor efficacy - Anticancer activities - Clinical development - Inhibition of tumor growth - Lewis lung carcinomata - Poor solubilities - Systemic toxicities - Therapeutic effects,5,
Hydrometallurgy,"The Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based leaching efficiency of impurity boron from metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) by HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4was investigated. The boron-doped Si(110) surface was selected as the interaction interface, and respective interactions of Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-with boron were performed. The principle of boron removal by hydrometallurgy was discussed in the context of a theoretical model and a comprehensive explanation for changes in the density of states (DOS) and bond population was provided. Based on the analysis of the effect of interactions on the electronic structure and properties of the boron-doped Si(110) surface, it was found that all three types of acid ions interact strongly with boron and NO3-registers the strongest interaction. The analysis of the bond population of Si-B showed that these bonds are more easily broken by NO3-than by either Cl-or SO42-, and the formation of B -O bonds is promoted. Furthermore, the effects of the three types of acid agents on the removal of boron from MG-Si were discussed.

Opt. Express,"The small size of plasmonic nanostructures compared to the wavelength of light is one of their most distinct and defining characteristics. It results in the strong compression of an incident wave to intense hot spots which have been used most remarkably for molecular sensing and nanoscale lasers. But another important direction for research is to use this ability to design miniaturized interconnects and modulators between fast, loss-less photonic components. Here we show that despite their high absorption, conductors are still the best materials to reach the sub-wavelength regime for efficient antennae when compared to polar crystals and high-index dielectrics, two classes of material which have shown a lot of potential recently in nanophotonic applications. By identifying the relevant dimensionless properties for the three materials considered, we present an unified understanding of the behaviour of sub-wavelength components which are at the heart of current photonic research and cast the upper achievable limits for radiative antennae crucial to the development of real-life implementation. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,,20150800538118,,"Francescato, Yan (1, 2); Yang, Jingjing (1); Huang, Ming (1); Maier, Stefan A.

Mater Lett,"Influence of nitrogen fractions[Nf=N2/(N2+Ar2)] on the structural and magnetic properties of Mn3NiNxthin films prepared on quartz substrates using magnetron sputtering have been studied. The N/Ni ratio increased (N/Ni=0.3-1.1) while the peak (200) shifted to lower angles with increasing Nf. It revealed that there was significant variation in the preferred orientation and Néel temperature (TN) for the films with increasing Nf. Strong indication for a frozen state is found, determined from the difference between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetizations. The ac susceptibility measurements show a peak position shifting as a function of the driving frequency f and magnetization value does not saturate in the field range. These findings consistently demonstrate that Mn3NiNxthin films exhibit a spin-glass state at low temperature. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TMS Annu Meet,"LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C composite was prepared by an improved solid-state method and the effect of calcination temperature on properties of the obtained materials was investigated. The results showed that increasing calcination temperature from 600 to 700 ° C improved the performance of the LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C due to enhanced crystallinity and increased conductivity, but further increase in calcination temperature to 800 °C led to degraded performance due to particle growth and decrease in porosity. Therefore, the LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C composite prepared at 700 °C exhibited the best electrochemical performance, and could deliver a high capacity of 152 mAh g-1at 0.1 C, 147 mAh g-1at 1 C and 114 mAh g-1at 10 C. In addition, the performance of the LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C and LiMn0.8Fe0.19Mg0.01PO4/C was compared when they were obtained at the optimum calcination temperature.

Astron. Astrophys.,"Context. Photometric monitoring of the variability of brown dwarfs can provide useful information about the structure of clouds in their cold atmospheres.The brown-dwarf binary system Luhman 16AB is an interesting target for such a study, because its components stand at the L/T transition and show high levels of variability. Luhman 16AB is also the third closest system to the solar system, which allows precise astrometric investigations with ground-based facilities. Aims. The aim of the work is to estimate the rotation period and study the astrometric motion of both components. Methods. We have monitored Luhman 16AB over a period of two years with the lucky-imaging camera mounted on the Danish 1.54 m telescope at La Silla, through a special i + z long-pass filter, which allowed us to clearly resolve the two brown dwarfs into single objects. An intense monitoring of the target was also performed over 16 nights, in which we observed a peak-to-peak variability of 0.20 ± 0.02 mag and 0.34 ± 0.02 mag for Luhman 16A and 16B, respectively. Results. We used the 16-night time-series data to estimate the rotation period of the two components. We found that Luhman 16B rotates with a period of 5.1 ± 0.1 h, in very good agreement with previous measurements. For Luhman 16A, we report that it rotates more slowly than its companion, and even though we were not able to get a robust determination, our data indicate a rotation period of roughly 8 h. This implies that the rotation axes of the two components are well aligned and suggests a scenario in which the two objects underwent the same accretion process. The 2-year complete data set was used to study the astrometric motion of Luhman 16AB. We predict a motion of the system that is not consistent with a previous estimate based on two months of monitoring, but cannot confirm or refute the presence of additional planetary-mass bodies in the system. © ESO, 2015.",,Open Access,20155001664500,A104,"Mancini, L.

Czech J. Food Sci.,"Macrocybe gigantea (Massee) Pegler & Lodge is a species of edible mushrooms which has important nutritional, medicinal, and economic values. Discrimination of M. gigantea with different storage periods is helpful to guarantee the authenticity and to promote marketing of this species. We focused on the establishment of the fingerprints based on UV spectroscopy to discriminate the wild-grown M. gigantea samples stored for different years and to distinguish the wild-grown and cultured samples which were stored for the same years. The analyses of the data were performed by multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). UV spectral fingerprints showed that the major composition and content of the main components were significantly variable over time. All the M. gigantea samples which were stored for different years could be successfully grouped by PCA and CA.

Rengong Jingti Xuebao,"In order to further improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of GaAs multi-junction solar cells, Al2O3/SiO2/Nano-SiO2(n=1.1) three-layer antireflection coatings with wide spectrum (350-1800 nm) were designed. The effects of each layer's thickness and refractive index on the effective reflectance of film system were analyzed. The results show that when the optimal physical thickness of Al2O3, SiO2and nano-SiO2is 88.21 nm, 113.42 nm and 163.38 nm respectively by programming calculation the minimum effective reflectance is 3.97%. The reflectance decreases as the the refractivity of SiO2decreasing or the refractivity of Al2O3proportionally increasing. In addition, the Al2O3/SiO2/nano-SiO2triple-layer antireflection coatings (no window layer) were prepared on GaAs substrate. The test and TFC simulation results show that the average effective reflectivity of the measured reflected spectrum is 11.04% at all wavelength, and the measured reflected spectrum is close to theoretical reflected spectrum with the range of 350-800 nm.

Dyes Pigm.,"Abstract Two coumarin-based fluorescence probes, 1 and 2, containing a methoxy oxalyl group as a reaction site were developed. These two novel probes displayed an instant turn-on fluorescence response specific towards Pi without interference from ATP and PPi. A selective 23-fold increase in fluorescence for 1 (in DMSO-HEPES) and a 20-fold increase for 2 (in DMSO) were observed. The proposed sensing mechanism for these compounds is Pi-triggered acetamide bond cleavage leading to release of the blue fluorophore coumarin, which was supported by1H NMR and mass spectrometry data. Probe 1 was successfully used to image endogenous and exogenous Pi in living cells and to trace Pi released from ATP by apyrase in Caenorhabditis elegans. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20152000853063,4753,"Wang, Huan (1); Guo, Lin E.

Chin. J. Geochem.,"The Langdu skarn copper deposit in the Zhongdian area, Yunnan Province, China, has an average Cu grade of 6.49 %. The deposit is related to a porphyry intrusion (~216 Ma), which was emplaced in the Upper Triassic sedimentary rocks of the Tumugou and Qugasi Formations. At the Langdu skarn copper deposit, carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of fresh limestones (δ18O = 3.0–5.6 ‰ relative to V-SMOW; δ13C = 24.5–25.7 ‰ relative to PDB) and partly altered limestones (δ18O = 27–7.2 to −1.9 ‰; δ13C = 11.8–15.2 ‰) indicated that the deposit was a typical marine carbonate source. Oxygen and carbon isotope values for calcites formed at different hydrothermal stages are −9.1 to 0.2 and 10.1–16.3 ‰, respectively. Moreover, the carbon–oxygen isotopic composition of an ore-forming fluid (δ18O = 5.0–9.5 ‰, δ13C = −7.3 to −5.3 ‰) suggested the presence of magmatic water, which most likely came from the differentiation or melting of a homologous magma chamber. The deposition of Calcite I may arise from metasomatism in an open system with a progressively decreasing temperature. Later, the minerals chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, quartz and Calcite II were precipitated due to immiscibility.

Ceram Int,"Meso- and macroporous coral-like Co3O4 was synthesized via a facile self-sustained decomposition using the complexes of metallic salts and organics (metal-organic complexes). Porous Co3O4 material was characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) to examine the morphology and microstructure to find out the cause. Co3O4 with the meso- and macroporous structure consisting of nanoparticles has a coral-like shape with a size of tens of micrometers and exhibits the hierarchically porous morphology, in which the walls of the macropores contain smaller mesopores. The gas-sensing characteristics of the porous Co3O4 for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were investigated. The gas response to 1000 ppm n-butanol reaches a maximum of 27.7 at an operating temperature of 120 °C, and about five times of the Co3O4 particles. The porous Co3O4 also exhibits certain selectivity and response/recovery time. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",,,20152100877725,,"Deng, Shaojuan (1); Chen, Nan (1); Deng, Dongyang (1); Li, Yuxiu (1); Xing, Xinxin (1); Wang, Yude (1, 2) ","(1) School of Physical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Yunnan Province Key Lab of Micro-Nano Materials and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",CINNDH,741.3 Optical Devices and Systems - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 914.1 Accidents and Accident Prevention - 932.1 High Energy Physics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Gas detectors - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Organometallics - Porous materials - Scanning electron microscopy - Synthesis (chemical) - Transmission electron microscopy - Volatile organic compounds - X ray powder diffraction - X rays,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wang, Yude(ydwang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.045,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: ZD2013006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department; Number: XT412003, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: 2011FA001, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 51262029, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51262029), the Key Project of the Department of Education of Yunnan Province (ZD2013006), Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University (XT412003), and the Department of Science and Technology of Yunnan Province via the Key Project for the Science and Technology (Grant No. 2011FA001).",,02728842,9,November 2015,English,X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,,36.0,11004-11012,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Ceramics International,,Meso- and macroporous coral-like Co3O4 for VOCs gas sensor,,Co3O4 - Flash synthesis - Gas sensing characteristics - Macroporous structures - Metal-organic complexes - Response/recovery time - Sensing performance - X ray photoelectron spectra,41,
Appl. Soft Comput. J.,"Processing lineages (also called provenances) over uncertain data consists in tracing the origin of uncertainty based on the process of data production and evolution. In this paper, we focus on the representation and processing of lineages over uncertain data, where we adopt Bayesian network (BN), one of the popular and important probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), as the framework of uncertainty representation and inferences. Starting from the lineage expressed as Boolean formulae for SPJ (Selection-Projection-Join) queries over uncertain data, we propose a method to transform the lineage expression into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) equivalently. Specifically, we discuss the corresponding probabilistic semantics and properties to guarantee that the graphical model can support effective probabilistic inferences in lineage processing theoretically. Then, we propose the function-based method to compute the conditional probability table (CPT) for each node in the DAG. The BN for representing lineage expressions over uncertain data, called lineage BN and abbreviated as LBN, can be constructed while generally suitable for both safe and unsafe query plans. Therefore, we give the variable-elimination-based algorithm for LBN's exact inferences to obtain the probabilities of query results, called LBN-based query processing. Then, we focus on obtaining the probabilities of inputs or intermediate tuples conditioned on query results, called LBN-based inference query processing, and give the Gibbs-sampling-based algorithm for LBN's approximate inferences. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Vacuum,"In this paper, a transient numerical model was applied to simulate the vacuum directional solidification (VDS) process of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) under different pulling-down rates, and the evolution of temperature distribution, thermal stresses and shape of solid/liquid (s/l) interface were simulated and analyzed. The experiments, such as the content and distribution of metal impurity, the crystal growth orientation and quality of mc-Si ingot were investigated to evaluate and validate the relationship between the thermal stresses and shape of s/l interface with simulation results. The results show that thermal stress, shape of interface s/l and temperature distribution in the silicon is determined by the thermal conditions in the furnace during the VDS process, and the crystal growth quality of mc-Si ingot relates closely to these factors. An appropriate pulling-down rate can satisfy thermal conditions to provide ideal temperature gradient in the silicon with lower thermal stresses and suitable s/l interface. We found that the mc-Si ingot produced by VDS process with pulling-down rate of 10 μm s-1had a larger grain size, a vertical columnar structure and an ideal efficiency of the impurity removal. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20151400709598,,"Lv, Guoqiang (1, 3); Chen, Daotong (1, 3); Yang, Xi (1, 2, 3); Ma, Wenhui (1, 2, 3); Luo, Tao (1, 2, 3); Wei, Kuixianai (1, 2, 3); Zhou, Yang (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (2) State Key Laboratory of Complex Nonferrous Metal Resources Cleaning Utilization in Yunnan Province, National Engineering Laboratory for Vacuum Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650093, China (3) Engineering Research Center for Silicon Metallurgy, Silicon Materials of Yunnan Provincial Universities, Kunming; 650093, China ",VACUAV,"534.2 Foundry Practice - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 641.1 Thermodynamics - 723.5 Computer Applications - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal Lattice - 933.1.2 Crystal Growth",,,,,Computer simulation - Crystal growth - Crystal impurities - Grain boundaries - Ingots - Numerical models - Polysilicon - Removal - Solidification - Temperature distribution - Thermal stress,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ma, Wenhui(mwhsilicon@163.com) ",10.1016/j.vacuum.2015.03.009,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2014J020, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; Number: KKZ3201352011, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology; Number: U1137601, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51466005, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013Z122, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Yunnan Provincial Department of Education; ","This work is supported by NSFC project (Nos. 51466005 and U1137601 ), the Key project of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education ( 2013Z122 ), the Graduate project of Yunnan Provincial Department of Education ( 2014J020 ), and the talent training Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology ( KKZ3201352011 ).",,0042207X,,"June 1, 2015",English,Crystal orientation,,26.0,96-103,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Vacuum,,Numerical simulation and experimental verification of vacuum directional solidification process for multicrystalline silicon,,Columnar structures - Distribution of metal - Growth orientations - Impurity removal - Multi-crystalline silicon - Multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) - Simulation and experimental verifications - Thermal condition,116,

Proc. Int. Conf. Comput. Sci. Netw. Technol.,"The efficiency research about protein sub-cellular localization has become a hot topic recently. Feature extraction plays an important role in the accurate classification or location of proteins. Since the contribution of each feature dimension is different, this paper enlarges the contribution of feature dimensions which have great effect on classification by weighting with its Fisher linear discriminant rate. Then k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used to classify the testing sample. The result shows that, compared to direct use of KNN algorithm, KNN with LDA dimensional reduction improves the predicting accuracy rate, and the proposed KNN based on Fisher's linear discriminant rate weighting method with LDA dimensional reduction can further reduce the redundance impact and enhance the accuracy of protein localization. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20163002647848,7490765,"Li, Wenjia (1); Wang, Shunfang (1); Xu, Dongshu (1) ","(1) School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650504, China ",,804.1 Organic Compounds - 921.5 Optimization Techniques - 922 Statistical Methods,122350.0,"December 19, 2015 - December 20, 2015","Harbin, China","4th International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, ICCSNT 2015",Computer networks - Discriminant analysis - Learning algorithms - Motion compensation - Proteins,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/ICCSNT.2015.7490765,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 11171293, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 11261068, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China (11261068, 11171293).",9781467381727.0,,,"June 13, 2016",English,Nearest neighbor search,"Proceedings of 2015 4th International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, ICCSNT 2015",19.0,342-346,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings of 2015 4th International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, ICCSNT 2015",Dalian Jiaotong University; Northeast Normal University; Shaanxi Normal University,Weighted feature dimensions according to Fisher's linear discriminant rate and its application on protein sub-cellular localization,,Dimensional reduction - Fisher linear discriminants - Fisher's linear discriminant - K nearest neighbor algorithm - K-nearest neighbor classifier - Protein localization - Sub-cellular - Weighted features,,

"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf. Syst., Man, Cybern., SMC","New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) possesses a world-class solar telescope which observes the sun by high resolution image instruments and multi-wave spectrometer in visible and near infrared bands. NVST has gathered millions of Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files since it has been for the routine observation and thousands of files are generated in a day. To search efficiently for a subset of these extremely large and linearly increasing FITS files with low latency and response time goes beyond traditional database systems. In this paper, We present an NVST indexing and querying framework (NIQF) based on an implementation of word-Aligned hybrid bitmaps to deal with the issue, and design several simple and useful APIs, which are convenient for integrating with NVST data archiving system and meet the requirements of fast data indexing of massive data processing in NVST. We study the performance of NIQF by comparing with MySQL. The results demonstrate that the performance of NIQF is more efficient than MySQL in a huge amount of solar data set. This study indicates potential performance and feasibility of NIQF for large astronomical data indexing and querying in NVST. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161802324946,7379409,"Liu, Ying-Bo (1, 2); Dai, Hui-Mei (1); Wang, Feng (1, 2); Dai, Wei (1, 2); Deng, Hui (1) ","(1) Computer Technology Application Key Lab of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; 650500, China (2) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming; 650011, China ",,723.2 Data Processing and Image Processing - 903.1 Information Sources and Analysis,119045.0,"October 9, 2015 - October 12, 2015","Kowloon Tong, Hong kong","IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC 2015",Cybernetics - Indexing (materials working) - Indexing (of information) - Infrared devices - Query processing - Telescopes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/SMC.2015.277,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,"Number: 11263004, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: U1231205, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1231205 and 11263004),9781479986965.0,,,"January 12, 2016",English,Data handling,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC 2015",28.0,1567-1572,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC 2015",IEEE SMC Society; K C Wong Foundation,Efficient Indexing and Querying of Massive Astronomical Data Using Compressed Word-Aligned Hybrid Bitmap,,Astronomical data - Fastbit - High resolution image - NoSQL - Solar telescope - Transport systems - Visible and near infrared - Word-Aligned Hybrid Bitmap,,

"IEEE CITS - Int. Conf. Comput., Inf. Telecommun. Syst.","In a passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) system, tag collision is generally resolved on medium access control (MAC) layer. However, some of collided tag signals could be recovered on physical (PHY) layer and thus enhance the identification efficiency of the RFID system. For the recovery on the PHY layer, channel estimation is a critical issue. Good channel estimation will help to correctly recover the collided signals. Existing channel estimates work well under the environment of two collided tags. When the number of collided tags is beyond two, however, the existing estimates have higher estimation errors. In this work, we propose a novel channel estimate for the UHF RFID system. The proposed estimate uses the information of preambles which is a-priori known for a reader and applies a least-square (LS) criterion. From numerical results, the proposed estimate has lower estimation errors than the existing estimates under the environment of more than two collided tags. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20155101683331,7297723,"Duan, Hanjun (1); Wu, Haifeng (1); Zeng, Yu (1) ","(1) School of Electrical and Information Technology, Yunnan University of Nationalities, Kunming, China ",,"716.1 Information Theory and Signal Processing - 716.3 Radio Systems and Equipment - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications",116341.0,"July 15, 2015 - July 17, 2015","Gijon, Spain","International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, IEEE CITS 2015",Medium access control - Network layers - Radio frequency identification (RFID) - Recovery - Signal reconstruction,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/CITS.2015.7297723,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9781467369459.0,,,"October 12, 2015",English,Channel estimation,"IEEE CITS 2015 - 2015 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",8.0,,1of1,2015,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE CITS 2015 - 2015 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems",Gijon Convention Bureau; Gijon Polytechnic School of Engineering and the Department of Informatics of the University of Oviedo,Channel estimation for recovery of UHF RFID tag collision on physical layer,,Estimation errors - Least Square - Least square criterion - Medium access control layer - Numerical results - Signal separation - Tag collision - Ultra High Frequency (UHF),,
Int J Hydrogen Energy,"To provide hexagonal Ca3Co2O6with better electrochemical performance as cathode material for solid-oxide fuel cell, Ca-doped LaCoO3perovskite is introduced as the second phase to achieve hetero-structured (1-x)Ca3Co2O6/x(La0.6Ca0.4)2Co2O6dual-phase composites. The composites are successfully synthesized via a simple one-pot method. They behave as thermal-activated semiconductors in the temperature range from 300 to 800 °C, and the electrical conductivity is progressively enhanced with increasing x. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the composite electrodes exhibit reduced area specific resistance, and the x = 0.5 composite cathode shows the lowest polarization behavior. A power density as high as 620 mW cm-2is attained at x = 0.5 measured at 800 °C on an electrolyte-supported single cell with pure H2as fuel. The improved performance in the dual-phase composite cathode can be ascribed to the enhanced conductivity and enlarged triple-phase boundary region for electrode reaction due to the presence of second phase. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.Published by Elsevier Ltd.

No significant difference is observed between the calculated optical and mechanical properties of the considered four crystal structures. The calculated results are in agreement with available reported experimental data. According to the calculated results, the fundamental band gap of Cu2ZnSnS4 is mainly determined by the bandwidth of the isolated conduction band. The effective-mass of carriers of Cu2ZnSnS4 are very small, especially the effective-mass of electrons on the bottom of the conduction band of zincblende-derived Cu2ZnSnS4.

J. Mater. Chem. A,"We herein report a novel noble-metal-free photocatalytic H2-production system by immobilizing CdS nanocrystals on ultrathin Co0.85Se/graphene nanosheets. The well-designed composite material was prepared by a simple solvothermal method and achieved a dramatically enhanced H2-evolution performance when compared with other bulk counterparts. Under optimal conditions, the H2-evolution efficiency can reach up to 17.60 μmol mg-1h-1after 10 h of LED visible light irradiation, which is comparable to that of noble Pt nanoparticles (18.60 μmol mg-1h-1). It is proposed that the unusual catalytic rate arises from the special nanostructure of Co0.85Se and a positive synergetic effect between Co0.85Se and graphene.

Trans. on Edutainment XI,"In order to improve the speed of texture synthesis, we propose an improved synthesis algorithm according to the Image Quilting algorithm in this paper. In this algorithm, the L-overlap region is replaced by r-overlap region to reduce the amount of the pixels used to compute the error of Sum-of-Squared Differences (SSD) and to lower the calculation redundancy. Parallel calculation is adopted to search the best synthesis patch from texture sample image and make further improvement on the synthesis speed. In addition, the area used for looking for the minimal cost path is enlarged from one patch to more patches that belong to the same row to retain or improve the synthesis effect. The experiment results show the proposed method has faster synthesis speed and lower algorithm complexity than the Image Quilting algorithm. © SSIEM and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

The generation mechanism of initial population and initial probability distribution model were proposed to make probability distribution model accumulate the high quality solutions' information properly, which could improve the search ability of AHEDA at the initial stage of evolution. To enhance AHEDA's global search ability, the adaptive update scheme based on information entropy was designed for probability distribution model, and the new population generation method was also constructed to keep excellent and good pattern. An Insert-based neighbor search was introduced to improve the local search ability. The effectiveness of the presented AHEDA was verified by computational experiments and comparisons. ©, 2015, CIMS.

According to the two-level periodical renewing information, each node can achieve real-time and comprehensive network traffic load status, and then the node adjusts backoff window properly to maximize the channel utilization. In order to avoid packet congestion, backoff window of each node shrinks linearly rather than exponentially as traffic load is sensed light, which can make transmission probability of nodes fluctuate around the optimal probability for p-persistent CSMA model.

Int. J. Bifurcation Chaos,"In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for HIV-1 infection with three time delays. The model examines a viral-therapy for controlling infections by using an engineered virus to selectively eliminate infected cells. In our model, three time delays represent the latent period of pathogen virus, pathogen virus production period and recombinant (genetically modified) virus production period, respectively. Detailed theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the values of three delays can affect the stability of equilibrium solutions, can also lead to Hopf bifurcation and oscillated solutions of the system. Moreover, we give the conditions for the existence of stable positive equilibrium solution and Hopf bifurcation. Further, the properties of Hopf bifurcation are discussed. These theoretical results indicate that the delays play an important role in determining the dynamic behavior quantitatively. Therefore, it is a fact that delays are very important, which should not be missed in controlling HIV-1 infections. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,,20154001337794,1550132,"Zhao, Lingyan (1); Liu, Haihong (1); Yan, Fang (1) ","(1) Department of Mathematics, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",,461.9 Biology - 713 Electronic Circuits - 921 Mathematics - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 961 Systems Science,,,,,Convergence of numerical methods - Diseases - System stability - Time delay - Viruses,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Liu, Haihong(lhhmath@aliyun.com) ",10.1142/S0218127415501321,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Bairen Program of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013Z014, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Chongqing Municipal Education Commission Foundation; Number: 2014FB138, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 2015FB140, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ",The author expresses gratitude to the anonymous referee for his/her helpful suggestions and the partial support of the Foundation of Education Commission (2013Z014) and Science Foundation (2014FB138 and 2015FB140) of Yunnan Province.,,02181274,10,"September 1, 2015",English,Hopf bifurcation,,13.0,,,2015,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Vacuum,"AlN chlorination route, in the present work, was proposed to extract Aluminum from aluminum nitride under vacuum. Density functional theory (DFT) were implemented to study the interaction of AlCl3molecule and AlN (101¯0) surface. The results of DFT indicate that chemisorbed AlCl3adsorption configuration was observed on the clean AlN (101¯0) surface after structure optimization, and adsorbed AlCl molecules were generated after 1 ps dynamic simulation time. The phase and composition of condensate were examined by means of XRD and EDS. It was found that 97.76 wt% of Al metal was obtained in the experiment B (in the presence of AlCl3), however, no condensate was collected in the experiment A (without AlCl3) at 1760 K under pressure of average 60 Pa.

Mater Charact,"Crystallographic orientation (CO) variation of magnetic-induced pearlite (MIP) during its microstructure evolution in 19.8 T was investigated by electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD). It is closely related to the isothermal temperatures (ITs) and the applied magnetic time (MT) during the process of MIP formation. The easy magnetization direction in MIP colonies is strengthened with the MT within the certain transformed fraction of MIP (fMIP) at the relatively lower IT (983 K) above the eutectoid temperature but below the magnetically shifted upward eutectoid temperature, while this special CO tends to be weakened at a relatively higher IT (995 K). For the same MT, the higher the IT, the relatively larger is the proportion in orientation for MIP colonies at the early growth stage. These results have demonstrated that the change of orientation of MIP is closely related to the growth rate of pearlite ferrite (PF), and strengthened mainly at early transformation stage. When fMIPreaches some value, the growth rate of MIP at other COs, such as , even at the hard magnetization direction, turns to present speed-up. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,20151900814686,,"Meng, Lan (1); Zhou, Xiaoling (1); Chen, Jianhao (1) ","(1) Faculty of Material Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan; 650093, China ",MACHEX,531.2 Metallography - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Backscattering - Diffraction - Isotherms - Magnetic fields - Magnetization - Microstructure - Pearlite - Pearlitic transformations,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Xiaoling(zxl2004z@tom.com) ",10.1016/j.matchar.2015.04.002,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 50971067, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: -, Acronym: NHMFL, Sponsor: National High Magnetic Field Laboratory; ","The experiments have been carried out at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.

Atmos. Environ.,"A regional climate model, RIEMS-POM, was used to study the direct radiative forcing (DRF) of sea salt on precipitation, sea surface temperature (SST) and summer circulation over East Asia with aerosol dataset from GOCART. The simulations predicted negative DRFs of-0.87Wm-2at the surface and-1.40Wm-2at the top of the atmosphere by sea salt. Results from the simulations suggest the forcing of sea salt produces a slight positive temperature anomaly and a reduction in precipitation over Southern China, accompanied by an opposite trend north of 40°N in Northern and Northeastern China. The tendency of wetting in North and drying in South by sea salt was mainly determined by the wind field, the vertical motion, as well as the local evaporation anomalies. The impacts of sea salt on SST suggest that the net surface shortwave radiative flux and the changes in convective cloud are important in forming the decreased SST throughout the year, while the northward oceanic heat transport anomaly and the other heat flux anomalies contribute relatively smaller. The feature by sea salt on SST imposes an extra force from the atmosphere to the ocean. The sea salt could also diminish the land-sea temperature contrast (LSTC) in summer and therefore the climatological summer circulation over East Asia, leading to reduced precipitation in Southern China. All these climatic feedbacks, such as LSTC and precipitation anomaly, will be attenuated when the SST is fixed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20150700528280,,"Guo, Jun (1); Yin, Yan (1, 2); Wu, Jian (3); Zhao, Deming (4) ","(1) Key Lab. for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration (CMA), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing; 210044, China (2) Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing; 210044, China (3) Department of Atmospheric Science, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (4) Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; 100029, China ",AENVEQ,"443 Meteorology - 443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 444.1 Surface Water - 471.1 Oceanography, General - 641.2 Heat Transfer - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 921 Mathematics - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Aerosols - Atmospheric radiation - Atmospheric temperature - Climate models - Heat flux - Precipitation (chemical) - Submarine geophysics - Surface properties - Surface waters - Wetting,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Wu, Jian(wujian@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.01.074,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),18732844,"Number: CXLX12_0498, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 20113228110002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 41275162, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 40975092, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 91337101, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This study was jointly supported by the National Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 91337101 , 40975092 , and 41275162 ), the Special Fund for Doctorate Programs in Chinese Universities (grant no. 20113228110002 ), and the Program for Postgraduate Research and Innovation in the Universities of Jiangsu Province, China (grant no.

Chem. Eng. Process.: Process Intensif.,"The clean utilization of the CuCl residue containing chloride produced from zinc hydrometallurgy residue is very important for the recycling of valuable metals. In order to strengthen the process of dechlorination, a new method of microwave roasting under the atmosphere of steam and oxygen was put forward. It was demonstrated that the dechlorination rate of CuCl residue by microwave roasting was higher than that of conventional roasting by tubular resistance furnace under the same conditions (temperature, holding time and atmosphere). After roasting at a temperature of 450. °C for 80. min under a gas flow rate of 150. mL/min in microwave filed, the dechlorination rate of CuCl residue was as high as 97%, increasing 18% compared to that of conventional roasting using tubular resistance furnace. The chatacterization of phases variation of CuCl residue in microwave field by means of XRD, SEM-EDS and Raman spectroscopy indicated that the process of dechlorination by microwave roasting under the atmosphere of steam and oxygen was much more efficient than conventional roasting. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20151700777519,,"Guo, Zhan-yong (1, 2, 3); Lei, Ting (4); Li, Wei (1, 2, 3); Luo, Hui-long (1, 2, 3); Ju, Shao-hua (1, 2, 3); Peng, Jin-hui (1, 2, 3); Zhang, Li-bo (1, 2, 3) ","(1) Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intensification Metallurgy, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (2) National Local Joint Laboratory of Engineering Application of Microwave Energy, Equipment Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (3) Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China (4) Kunming Metallurgy College, Kunming, Yunnan; 650093, China ",CENPEU,531.1 Metallurgy - 631.1.2 Gas Dynamics - 711 Electromagnetic Waves - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products Generally,,,,,Calcination - Chlorine compounds - Dechlorination - Electric furnaces - Flow of gases - Hydrometallurgy - Microwaves - Ores - Oxygen - Strengthening (metal),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ju, Shao-hua(shj_200801@126.com) ",10.1016/j.cep.2015.03.024,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: -, Acronym: MOST, Sponsor: Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of Bangladesh; Number: 51104073, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 2013HA002, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; ","The authors gratefully acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 51104073) and Technology of People’s Republic of China, Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents scheme–Technological Leading Talent (No. 2013HA002) for funding this work.",,02552701,,"June 01, 2015",English,Copper compounds,,31.0,67-73,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Chemical Engineering and Processing - Process Intensification,,Clean utilization of CuCl residue by microwave roasting under the atmosphere of steam and oxygen,,CuCl residue - Dechlorination rate - Holding time - Microwave field - Resistance furnaces - SEM-EDS - Valuable metals - Zinc hydrometallurgy,92,
J. Organomet. Chem.,"Abstract A series of structurally novel organometallic compounds (3a-g) based on 1-biaryl-3-ferrocenylprop-2-en-1-one, were synthesized by the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction for applications as nonlinear optical (NLO) and liquid crystal (LC) materials. Notably, a single crystal of this class of compounds was obtained for the very first time, and it was found that the two phenyl rings of the chalconyl group were nearly coplanar to one of the cyclopentadienyl rings of ferrocene. Due to the high degree of conjugation, all the chalcone analogues of ferrocenyl biaryl derivatives displayed strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response (0.45-0.60 × 10-30esu, 3-4 times greater that of potassium dideuterophosphate (KDP)). The density functional theory (DFT) was employed to calculate the main molecular orbital energies and compositions of 3d, based on its crystallographic structure. Compound 3d was found to exhibit excellent NLO properties due to its low Egapand superior charge transfer ability within the conjugated system. This work presents a new approach for the preparation of this class of ferrocenyl biaryl derivatives, which may have potential applications as NLO materials. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,,20152600971677,19085,"Teng, Ming-Yu (1); Zhang, Jie (3); Huang, Guo-Li (1); Liu, Bo (1); Li, Xiao-Mei (1); Rong, Mei-Zhu (1); Shen, Tian-Hua (2); Song, Qing-Bao (2) ","(1) Facult of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China (2) State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, School of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou; 310014, China (3) School of Pharmmaceutical and Chemical Engineering, Taizhou University, Taizhou; 318000, China ",JORCAI,741.1 Light/Optics - 741.1.1 Nonlinear Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 922.1 Probability Theory - 933.1 Crystalline Solids,,,,,Charge transfer - Chemical bonds - Chemical reactions - Density functional theory - Harmonic generation - Iron compounds - Liquid crystals - Molecular orbitals - Optical properties - Organometallics - Potassium compounds - Single crystals,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Song, Qing-Bao ",10.1016/j.jorganchem.2015.05.044,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,0022328X,,"June 24, 2015",English,Nonlinear optics,,43.0,298-302,,2015,Elsevier B.V.,Journal of Organometallic Chemistry,,Synthesis and nonlinear optical properties of novel chalcone analogues of ferrocenyl biaryl derivatives,,Chalcones - Crystallographic structure - DFT study - Ferrocenyl derivatives - NLO materials - Non-linear optical properties - Organometallic compounds - Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction,791,
"Asia-Pacific Pow. Energy Eng. Conf., APPEEC","The vibration of power transformer is closely related to the mechanical condition of transformer and current when the external short circuit occurs. In this paper, the vibration sensors based on piezoelectric effect are attached to the oil tank of transformer to acquire the vibration signals in short circuit condition, and then the transfer function is applied to study the relationship between the vibration and short- circuit current under multiple short circuit shocks. Compared with traditional frequency domain or time- frequency domain analysis, this method can normalize the vibration in different short circuit condition and clearly illustrate the relationship between vibration and current. The conclusion shows that this method is feasible to evaluate the mechanical condition of transformer by using the correlation analysis of amplitude- frequency characteristic of transfer function in different short circuit condition. © 2015 IEEE.",,,20161902366898,7381064,"Zhang, Fan (1); Ji, Shengchang (1); Qian, Guochao (2); Zou, Dexu (2); Xu, Xiaowei (2) ","(1) State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China (2) Electric Research Institute, Yunnan Power Technology Branch, Kunming, China ",,523 Liquid Fuels - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 703.1.1 Electric Network Analysis - 704.2 Electric Equipment - 706.2 Electric Power Lines and Equipment - 713.4 Pulse Circuits - 921 Mathematics - 921.3 Mathematical Transformations - 922.2 Mathematical Statistics,119093.0,"November 15, 2015 - November 18, 2015","Brisbane, QLD, Australia","IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC 2015",Correlation methods - Electric network analysis - Frequency domain analysis - Oil filled transformers - Oil tanks - Piezoelectricity - Power transformers - Timing circuits - Transfer functions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1109/APPEEC.2015.7381064,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),21574847,,,9781467381321.0,21574839,,"January 12, 2016",English,Vibration analysis,"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC 2015",11.0,,1of1,2015,IEEE Computer Society,"Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC",Energex; ERGON Energy; NOJA Power; Powerlink,The study on vibration characteristic of power transformer in short circuit by transfer function,,Amplitude frequency characteristics - Correlation analysis - Multiple short circuits - Short circuit shocks - Short-circuit conditions - Time-frequency domain analysis - vibration - Vibration characteristics,2016-January,
Int. J. Food Prop.,"The aroma characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon wines from five different altitudes (Xidang-2110, Dari-2249, Jiunongding-2330, Adong-2610, and Jiangpo-2788, respectively) in the plateau of Yunnan (China) were detected by headspace solid phase micro-extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The results showed that the numbers of volatile compounds increased with altitude rising, while the concentration of the total volatiles decreased with the exception of Xidang-2110. Alcohol and esters accounted for more than 97% of the total volatile compounds. Ten out of thirty-six components (22%) identified and quantified in five wines were found at concentrations higher than their corresponding threshold values (OAVs > 1). Ethyl hexanoate, ethyl butyrate, and 1-octen-3-ol were the three most powerful odorants in wine from Xidang-2110; but odor activity values and relative odor contribution of 1-octen-3-ol were higher than ethyl hexanoate and ethyl butyrate in the wines from Dari-2249 and Adong-2610; meanwhile β-damascenone, ethyl hexanoate, and 1-octen-3-ol were the three most powerful odorants in wines from Jiunongding-2330 and Jiangpo-2788. © Copyright 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Open Access,20151600765826,,"Yue, Tai-Xin (1, 2, 3); Chi, Ming (1, 2); Song, Chang-Zheng (1, 2); Liu, Mei-Ying (1, 2); Meng, Jiang-Fei (1, 2); Zhang, Zhen-Wen (1, 2); Li, Mei-Hua (4) ","(1) College of Enology, Northwest AandF University, Yangling, Shaanxi; 712100, China (2) Shaanxi Engineering Research Center for Viti-Viniculture, Northwest AandF University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China (3) Baotou Light Industry Vocational Technical College, Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China (4) Planning and Construction Service Center, Peoples Government of Beigu, Beigu, Yunnan, China ",IJFPFO,801 Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 822.3 Food Products,,,,,Gas chromatography - Mass spectrometry - Odors - Volatile organic compounds,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Zhen-Wen(zhangzhw60@nwsuaf.edu.cn) ",10.1080/10942912.2014.923442,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15322386,"Number: -, Acronym: CAU, Sponsor: China Agricultural University; Number: CARS-30-zp-9, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Agriculture Research System of China; ","The author’s would like to acknowledge the assistance from Ke-Xu Cui, Jian-Hong Cao, and Jia-Kui Wang of Shangri-La Winery Company Limited for providing the grape samples.

Optik,"Unlike the previous design method in which one must know the transformation function beforehand, an inverse design method is proposed to build a metamaterial concentrator in this paper. The required material parameters are independently obtained and expressed as functions of the introduced generator. Scattering magnifying ability of the concentrator and two applications for antenna miniaturization and military camouflage are also investigated. Moreover, to remove the anisotropic parameters and simplify the practical realization of the concentrator, a fan-shaped layered concentrator composed of only alternating isotropic materials is presented based on the effective medium theory. Full-wave simulation results are provided for verification. This work paves a new way for designing metamaterial devices without the need to know the underlying transformation function, and has great guiding significance for the fabrication and application of the concentrator. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.",,,20152000849154,,"Li, Tinghua (1); Huang, Ming (1); Yang, Jingjing (1); Liang, Yan (1); Yuan, Gang (1) ","(1) Wireless Innovation Lab, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, No. 2 North Cuihu Road, Kunming, Yunnan; 650091, China ",,404.1 Military Engineering - 484 Seismology - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Anisotropic media - Antennas - Concentration (process) - Inverse problems - Metamaterials - Military applications - Seismic waves,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Huang, Ming(huangming@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.03.028,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2011FB018, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 2013M531989, Acronym: -, Sponsor: China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Number: 2013FA006, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: -, Acronym: YNU, Sponsor: Yunnan University; Number: XT512004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 61261002, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 61161007, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 61161007 , 61261002 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (Grant no. 2011FB018 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant no. 2013M531989 ), Key Program of Natural Science of Yunnan Province (Grant no. 2013FA006 ), and the Fostering Foundation (Grant no.

Int J Hydrogen Energy,"Cobalt-free perovskite oxides NdBaCu2O5+δ(NBCO) and NdBa0.5Sr0.5Cu2O5+δ(NBSCO) has been investigated as cathode materials in intermediate-temperature solid fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). The crystal structure, thermal expansion, electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), dilatometer, four-probe dc method, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cathodic polarization examinations. The average thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) values of NBCO and NBSCO are 13.0 × 10-6/°C and 14.5 × 10-6/°C, which are more desirable on combining with the electrolytes than cobalt-based cathodes. The partly substitution of Sr on B-site increases the electron hole concentration and improves the conductivity. The polarization resistances values of NBSCO are 0.205 Ωcm2, 0.200 Ωcm2and 0.135 Ωcm2, whereas the polarization resistances values of NBCO are 8.61 Ωcm2, 3.18 Ωcm2and 0.83 Ωcm2at 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C, respectively.

J Alloys Compd,"As promising solar cell absorb materials, detailed density functional theory calculations of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)4alloys with different crystal structures (including: zincblende-derived kesterite, zincblende-derived stannite, wurtzite-derived kesterite, and wurtzite-derived stannite) over the whole range of Se composition from x = 0 to x = 1 were systematically investigated in the present work. The calculated results revealed that the lattice constants variation of Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)4alloys obey the Vegard's law; and the wurtzite-derived alloys have better alloy solubility and component-uniform compared with zincblende-derived alloys. In the whole range of x, the calculated lattice constants, band gaps, dielectric constants, and refractive index are nearly linear varying with Se compositions. Using the fitting functional relationships, one not only designs suitable Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)4alloys as absorber materials for solar cells, but also determines the composition of Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)4alloys by conventional optical measurements in practice. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of the condensation conditions, including the temperature, temperature gradient and pressure, on the recovery efficiency of Mg vapor was investigated with X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results show that the pressure, condensation temperature and temperature gradient, strongly affect the recovery efficiency of Mg vapor and microstructures of Mg condensate. To be specific, in the 30~100 Pa range and with a fixed temperature gradient, a temperature close to the dew-point of Mg vapor resulted in high Mg recovery efficiency; at the optimized condensation temperature and pressure, a decreased temperature gradient increased the compactness and grain-size of the 90.05% pure Mg-condensate. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Sci. Total Environ.,"Background: Diurnal temperature range (DTR) is an important meteorological indicator that reflects weather stability and is associated with global climate change and urbanization. Previous studies have explored the effect of DTR on human health in coastal cities with small daily temperature variations, but we have little evidence for high plateau regions where large DTRs usually occur. Using daily mortality data (2007-2013), we conducted a time-series analysis to assess the effect of DTR on daily mortality in Yuxi, a high plateau city in southwest China. Methods: Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate DTR effects on daily mortality, controlling for daily mean temperature, relative humidity, sunshine duration, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, day of the week, and seasonal and long-term trends. Results: The cumulative effects of DTR were J-shaped curves for non-accidental, cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular mortality, with a U-shaped curve for respiratory mortality. Risk assessments showed strong monotonic increases in mortality starting at a DTR of approximately 16. °C. The relative risk of non-accidental morality with extreme high DTR at lag 0 and 0-21. days was 1.03 (95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.11) and 1.33 (0.94-1.89), respectively.

Can. J. Earth Sci.,"Based on the geomagnetic field model NGDC-720-V3 (National Geophysical Data Center), the distribution of crustal magnetic anomalies and the Curie surface beneath Tarim Basin, China, and its adjacent area were investigated. The results show that the spatial distribution of the magnetic anomalies in Tarim Basin coincides with the regional tectonic structure, i.e., a basin sandwiched between mountain ranges. Shallow parts of the Curie surface are located in uplifted zones of the basin and correspond well to high values of heat flow. In contrast, deep parts of the Curie surface, having low values of heat flow, are distributed along the depression zones of the basin. The Curie point depth is consistent with the measured heat flow value, with a correlation coefficient of 0.65. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

Stoch. Environ. Res. Risk Assess.,"Understanding the relationships between hydrological regime and climate change is important for water resources management. In this study, the streamflow response to climate change was investigated in the Lake Dianchi watershed, which is one of the most important eutrophic lakes in China. Daily time-series of temperature and precipitation in the future periods (2020, 2050 and 2080s) were projected from HadCM3 model. Statistical downscaling model (SDSM) and the previously calibrated and validated Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model were used to quantify the impacts of climate change on streamflow in this watershed. The results showed that SDSM can well capture the statistical relationships between the large scale climate variables and the observed weather at regional scale. The downscaled results showed that annual average maximum and minimum temperature would rise by 4.28 (3.25) and 4.71 °C (3.33 °C) in the 2080s under A2 (B2) scenario. Annual average precipitation would decrease within the range between 20.34 and 74.12 mm under both scenarios in the future. Based on SWAT model simulation, annual average streamflow would decrease in the future by the declination of −7.12 to −21.83 % and −6.34 to −17.09 % under A2 (B2) scenarios in the outlet of this watershed. The frequency of drought and extreme rainfall events would increase in the future, which is not beneficial to protect Lake Dianchi.

Rendiconti Lincei,"Soil is a major carbon sink or source on terrestrial ecosystems. Despite their great importance, humus forms, which constitute the small portion above the soil, have been often neglected in local studies and in international research projects. In the present work we evaluated the organic carbon stocked in the different humus forms in a Mediterranean lowland forest, to highlight the carbon concentration in different vegetation types, particularly between evergreen and deciduous woodlands. Results showed that the carbon stock stored in the organic and organo-mineral horizons of humus and soil, expressed in Tons/Ha, had a wide range for each vegetation type, reflecting the high diversity of the forest vegetation and the variability within each type. The vegetation with the highest value of carbon stock despite its small extension was represented by humid woodlands dominated by Fraxinusoxycarpa, a relic forest type occurring in the dune slacks within the study area, which gives, therefore, an important contribution to the climate warming reduction. We demonstrated as the humus forms play a role in the carbon sequestration in a forest ecosystem; therefore, it may be important to add the evaluation of carbon stock when carbon concentration is evaluated for the soil and above and plants below ground biomass. © 2014, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.",,,20144900300883,,"Cicuzza, Daniele (1); De Nicola, Cristina (2); Testi, Anna (2); Pignatti, Sandro (2); Zanella, Augusto (3) ","(1) Center for Integrative Conservation, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla; Yunnan; 666303, China (2) Department of Environmental Biology, La Sapienza, Botanical Garden, Largo Cristina di Svezia 24, Rome, Italy (3) Department Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry (TESAF), University of Padua, Viale dell’Università 16, Legnaro; Padova; 35020, Italy ",,443.1 Atmospheric Properties - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 804.1 Organic Compounds,,,,,Ecosystems - Global warming - Organic carbon - Soils - Vegetation,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","De Nicola, Cristina(cristinamariapilar.denicola@uniroma1.it) ",10.1007/s12210-014-0352-7,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),17200776,,,,20374631,,"November 1, 2015",English,Forestry,,64.0,403-411,,2015,Springer-Verlag Italia s.r.l.,Rendiconti Lincei,,Which is the contribution to the carbon sequestration of the forest ecosystems in the Castelporziano Reserve?

Mater Chem Phys,"One-dimension (1D) Co3O4/ZnO core/shell nanorods (NRs) were synthesized on nickel foil substrate by means of a two-step synthetic strategy. Co3O4NRs were initially fabricated by a facile hydrothermal reaction and then ZnO was coated via a simple thermal decomposition. The results verified that the surface of the p-type Co3O4core was uniformly assembled by the n-type ZnO nanoparticles with approximate 20 nm thickness. Compared with pristine Co3O4NRs, Co3O4/ZnO core/shell NRs was exhibited to have a much higher photocatalytic properties in the decomposition of a model dye compound, methylene blue (MB), under ultraviolet irradiation. As confirmed by Photoluminescence (PL) spectra, the formation of p-n junction heterostructures gives rise to the enhanced photocatalystic performance of Co3O4/ZnO core/shell NRs. This study provides a general and effective method in the fabrication of 1D composition NRs with sound heterojunctions that show remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic performance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Math. Probl. Eng.,"Most classical search engines choose and rank advertisements (ads) based on their click-through rates (CTRs). To predict an ad's CTR, historical click information is frequently concerned. To accurately predict the CTR of the new ads is challenging and critical for real world applications, since we do not have plentiful historical data about these ads. Adopting Bayesian network (BN) as the effective framework for representing and inferring dependencies and uncertainties among variables, in this paper, we establish a BN-based model to predict the CTRs of new ads. First, we built a Bayesian network of the keywords that are used to describe the ads in a certain domain, called keyword BN and abbreviated as KBN. Second, we proposed an algorithm for approximate inferences of the KBN to find similar keywords with those that describe the new ads. Finally based on the similar keywords, we obtain the similar ads and then calculate the CTR of the new ad by using the CTRs of the ads that are similar with the new ad. Experimental results show the efficiency and accuracy of our method. © 2014 Zhipeng Fang et al.",,Open Access,20152500955629,818203,"Fang, Zhipeng (1); Yue, Kun (1, 2); Zhang, Jixian (1); Zhang, Dehai (2, 3); Liu, Weiyi (1) ","(1) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Key Laboratory of Software Engineering of Yunnan Province, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Department of Software Engineering, School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",,"723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory",,,,,Bayesian networks - Forecasting - Search engines,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Yue, Kun ",10.1155/2014/818203,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15635147,,,,1024123X,,2015,English,Barium compounds,,26.0,,,2015,"Hindawi Limited, 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb, New York, NY 10022, United States",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,Predicting Click-Through Rates of New Advertisements Based on the Bayesian Network,,Approximate inference - Click-through rate - Historical data - Real-world,2014,
Lect. Notes Comput. Sci.,"Community detection, a fundamental task in social network analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes in a network such that nodes within a group are much more connected to each other than to the rest of the network. The cooperative theory and non-cooperative game theory have been used separately for detecting communities. In this paper, we develop a new approach that utilizes both cooperative and non-cooperative game theory to detect communities. The individuals in a social network are modelled as playing cooperative game for achieving and improving group’s utilities, meanwhile individuals also play the non-cooperative game for improving individual’s utilities. By combining the cooperative and non-cooperative game theories, utilities of groups and individuals can be taken into account simultaneously, thus the communities detected can be more rational and the computational cost will be decreased. The experimental results on synthetic and real networks show that our algorithm can fast detect overlapping communities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,20153001068862,,"Zhou, Lihua (1); Yang, Peizhong (1); Lü, Kevin (2); Wang, Lizhen (1); Chen, Hongmei (1) ","(1) School of Information, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (2) Brunel University, Uxbridge; UB8 3PH, United Kingdom ",,"721.1 Computer Theory, Includes Formal Logic, Automata Theory, Switching Theory, Programming Theory - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 922.1 Probability Theory - 971 Social Sciences",119149.0,"July 6, 2015 - July 8, 2015","Edinburgh, United kingdom","30th British International Conference on Databases, BICOD 2015",Computation theory - Population dynamics - Social networking (online),"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Lü, Kevin(kevin.lu.brunel@gmail.com) ",10.1007/978-3-319-20424-6_7,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),16113349,,,9783319204239.0,03029743,,2015,English,Game theory,,22.0,62-73,1 of 1,2015,Springer Verlag,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Science; sicsa: The Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance; University of Edinburgh,A fast approach for detecting overlapping communities in social networks based on game theory,,Community detection - Computational costs - Cooperative and non-cooperative game theory - Cooperative game - Non-cooperative game theory - Noncooperative game - Overlapping communities - Overlapping community detections,9147,"Data Science - 30th British International Conference on Databases, BICOD 2015, Proceedings"

Multimedia Tools Appl,"A linear approach using three tangent circles is proposed for determining the intrinsic parameters of cameras. A projected circle can be used to compute the image coordinate of the centre of each tangent circle and to find the points in the image corresponding to the tangent points associated with the images of the centres of the projected circles. The vanishing point can be determined along the circle diameter according to the invariance of the cross-ratio. Solving the equations for the tangent lines produced a curve in the image of the tangent point and its corresponding point. The other vanishing point can be obtained from the intersection point of the two tangent lines. With vanishing points in two orthogonal directions, the intrinsic parameters can be linearly determined. The results of our experiments show that this approach is effective and highly precise. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,,20143600050987,,"Chen, Xu (1); Zhao, Yue (2) ","(1) Lijiang Tourism and Culture College, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China (2) School of Mathematics and Statistics, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China ",MTAPFB,605 Small Tools and Hardware - 723.5 Computer Applications - 742.2 Photographic Equipment,,,,,Hardware - Multimedia systems,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhao, Yue ",10.1007/s11042-014-1879-4,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15737721,,,,13807501,15,"February 6, 2015",English,Cameras,,16.0,5709-5723,,2015,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Multimedia Tools and Applications,,A linear approach for determining camera intrinsic parameters using tangent circles,,Camera intrinsic parameters - Circular points - Image coordinates - Intersection points - Intrinsic parameters - Orthogonal directions - Tangent circle - Vanishing point,74,
Rock Soil Mech,"According to the engineering geological characteristics of bedding rock slope in Puli-Xuanwei Expressway in Yunnan province, the structural planes are divided into four types based on their formation mode. A home-made loading device is used to test the compression strength and shear strength of structural planes under natural conditions; and strength parameter values are obtained by least square linear fitting method, structural surface shear strength parameter values are obtained. By contrasting the equivalent shear strength of Mohr-Coulomb method based on JRC-JCS, the results basically agree with each other; and the feasibility of the device is verified. Considering filling thickness, moisture content of filler and other factors based on different types of slope structural planes, the shear strength parameters is obtained through several shear tests. The results show that the values of shear strength parameters in saturated state are smaller than that in the state of nature, meanwhile c increases and ψ decreases gradually with the increase of filling thickness.

"Proc. - Int. Symp. Educ.

Based on the effects of individual characteristics on learning, a novel framework is proposed for designing an undergraduate-oriented recommender system of MOOCs in which the particular characteristics of the participants, such as cognitive level, knowledge background, personal expectation, learning interest, learning motivation and learning style are emphasized. More specifically, the particular characteristics of undergraduates are introduced into the discussion of the recommendation methods including contentbased recommendation and collaborative filtering recommendation.

A state-dependent two-level polling model was established to analyze the QoS performance of M2M under unsaturated condition and perfect channel in the IEEE 802.11. To improve the transmission effective of massive M2M service, machine without transmission requirement would be set in the idle state and only active machine could access in the network.

Cailiao Yanjiu Xuebao,"A new melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) resin was prepared with concentrated formaldehyde and degradated liquid of soy-protein as raw materials. The molecular structure and thermal mechanical properties of MUF resin were characterized by13C-NMR, FT-IR and DMA. The prepared MUF resins were used as bonding material to fabricate particleboards and then their bonding strength and modulus of rupture(MOR) as well as free formaldehyde content were also examined. The results show that with the MUF resin synthesized merely with concentrated formaldehyde (hereinafter named MUF resin-F), the bonding strength and MOR of the fabricated particleboard increased by 25% and 64%, and the free formaldehyde content decreased by 52%; however, with the MUF resin synthesized jointly with concentrated formaldehyde and degradated liquid of soy-protein (herinafter named MUF resin-FP), the bonding strength and MOR of the fabricated particleboard increased by 48% and 97% respectively, and the free formaldehyde content decreased by 56%. The FT-IR results indicated that the degradated liquid of soy-protein did react with MUF.13C-NMR and DMA results indicated that the MUF resin-F has high amount of ether bond and high condensation degree, high initial strength and low thermal stability; in the contrast, the MUF resin-FP has high condensation degree and high amount of methylene bridge bond, which can offset the instability induced by the fracture and rearrangement of ether bonds. In sum, the newly synthesized MUF resin-FP possesses good thermal mechanical properties, high strength and low free formaldehyde content. © All right reserved.",,,20155001671212,,"Wu, Zhigang (1, 2); Xi, Xuedong (2); Cao, Ming (3); Wang, Hui (2); Lei, Hong (2); Zhang, Bengang (2); Du, Guanben (2) ","(1) College of Matericals Science and Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing; 650224, China (2) Wood Adhesives and Glued Products Key Laboratory of Yunnan Province, Southwest Forestry University, Kunming; 650224, China (3) College of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing; 210037, China ",CYXUEV,"415.4 Structural Materials Other Than Metal, Plastics or Wood - 802.2 Chemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical Operations - 804.1 Organic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic Polymers - 951 Materials Science",,,,,Biosynthesis - Concentration (process) - Condensation - Diffusion bonding - Ethers - Formaldehyde - Liquids - Mechanical properties - Metabolism - Particle board - Proteins - Resins - Urea,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Du, Guanben(gongben9@hotmail.com) ",,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10053093,11,"November 25, 2015",Chinese,Urea formaldehyde resins,,27.0,814-820,,2015,Chinese Journal of Materials Research,Cailiao Yanjiu Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Materials Research,,Synthesis of a new melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin-preparation of MUF with degradated liquid of soy-protein and concentrated formaldehyde,,Condensation degree - Melamine urea formaldehydes - Melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin - Modulus of rupture - Organic polymer material - Soy protein - Structure characteristic - Thermal mechanical properties,29,
Zhongguo Youse Jinshu Xuebao,"The arsenic and antimony were removed from bismuth-rich lead anode slime by alkaline pressure oxidation leaching. The effects of factors including oxidant dosage, NaOH concentration, ratio of liquid to solid, leaching temperature and leaching time on the arsenic and antimony removal were investigated, and the optimal process conditions were determined by experiments. The results show that the leaching rate of arsenic and antimony can reach over 95% and 80%, respectively. The removal of antimony can be realized by adding hydrogen peroxide after the removal of crystal sodium arsenate and lead antimonate by cooling and filtration. The alkaline leaching solution is returned to the leaching process after adding quantitative sodium hydroxide, which achieves the recycling of alkaline solution and the effective separation of arsenic and antimony from other metals. ©, 2015, Central South University of Technology.

,"Dark septate endophytes (DSE) ubiquitously colonize the roots of plants growing in extreme heavy metals (HMs)-contaminated soils. Little is known about the overall molecular response of DSE to excessive HMs. Therefore, RNA-seq was performed through Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing based on two cDNA libraries of the DSE strain Exophiala pisciphila, cultured under cadmium (Cd)-free and Cd-stressed conditions, and 21,376 unigenes were generated. In total, 575 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. Approximately 40% of the DEGs (228 unigenes) were involved in 10 well-known HMs-tolerant pathways, conferring the extreme cadmium (Cd) tolerance of E. pisciphila, including metal ion binding and transportation, organic acid metabolism and transportation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, redox homeostasis, transcription factors production, sulfate assimilation, DNA repair and cell wall integrity maintenance, etc. Our results indicate that integral tactics associated with the collaboration of extracellular and intracellular mechanisms contribute to the enhanced HMs tolerance of this fungus.

Mater. Res. Innov.,"This research studied the effects of a triaxial stress thermal-hydromechanical coal-containing-gas permeameter on mechanical and gas seepage characteristics under different confining pressures, different initial axial stress and different unloading speeds of the confining pressure. The results showed that in the process of unloading the confining pressure before peak strength, the strain (permeability) could be divided into three stages. As the unloading speed was increased the duration of the initial axial stress time would decrease, along with the duration of the axial stress platform. The permeability was closely related to the unloading of the confining pressure and the initial axial stress, which, when increased, would lead to accelerated strain growth. Additionally, the results of the experiment that unloaded the confining pressure after peak strength showed that strain (permeability) could be divided into two stages, and when compared to the experiment done before peak strength, the duration of the axial stress platform was greatly shortened. © W.

Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue,"This study analyzed the effect of water pollution control charging policies (wastewater charging system, sewage treatment charging policy and staged water price policy) which were currently implemented in Dianchi Lake basin. And then the performance of water pollution control charging policies of Dianchi Lake basin from 2001 to 2012 were evaluated using the C2R model and BC2model. The results showed that the policies of wastewater charging system, sewage treatment charging policy and staged water price policy had played important roles for reducing waste water emissions and improving the water using efficiency in the Dianchi Lake basin. The technical efficiency level of water pollution control charging policy in Dianchi Lake basin were high with a mean value of 0.902. The main factor affecting the water pollution control charging policy of Dianchi Lake basin was the industrial added value per unit COD discharge, therefore the government of Dianchi Lake basin could raise the standards of corporate sewage charges or levy discharge taxes in order to reduce pollutants emissions. Adjusting the impose standards of different policies appropriately, as the important environmental economic policies, would help to improve the implementation efficiency level of policies. ©, 2015, Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences.

Int. J. Climatol.,"This study investigated spatial and temporal variations of extreme precipitation over Yunnan Province during 1960-2012. On the basis of a dataset from 120 meteorological stations covering the region, ten precipitation indices derived from daily precipitation were computed and analysed. Our results indicate the precipitation indices showed spatially complex trends. Most precipitation indices present increasing trends in western Yunnan and decreasing trends in eastern Yunnan. The western, southern and central regions experienced an increase in consecutive dry days (CDDs) and decrease in consecutive wet days (CWDs). In addition, a widespread increase was also found in precipitation intensity over Yunnan. On a region-wide scale, a weak decrease was observed in total precipitation, accompanied by an increase in precipitation intensity. CDDs tended to be prolonged while the CWDs tended to be shortened. The days with precipitation amounts totaling more than 10mm and maximum 5-day precipitation amount had decreasing but not significant trends. In contrast, insignificant increases were found for the maximum 1-day precipitation and annual total precipitation exceeding 95th and 99th percentiles. The contribution of extreme precipitation to total precipitation increased during 1960-2012. Overall, occurrences of extreme precipitation are more concentrated in time. The weakening of the Asian summer monsoon strength and local topography had contribution to the variations of extreme precipitation over Yunnan. However, the forcing mechanisms are very complicated and need to be studied in subsequent work. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.",,,20143600055534,,"Li, Yun-Gang (1, 2); He, Daming (1, 2); Hu, Jin-Ming (1, 2); Cao, Jie (3) ","(1) Yunnan Key Laboratory of International Rivers and Transboundary Eco-security, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (2) Asian International Rivers Center, Yunnan University, Kunming, China (3) Department of Atmospheric Science, Yunnan University, Kunming, China ",IJCLEU,443 Meteorology,,,,,Climatology - Earth atmosphere,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","He, Daming ",10.1002/joc.3977,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),10970088,,,,08998418,2,"February 1, 2015",English,Precipitation (meteorology),,57.0,245-258,,2015,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, United Kingdom",International Journal of Climatology,,"Variability of extreme precipitation over Yunnan Province, China 1960-2012",,China - Daily precipitations - Extreme precipitation - Trend analysis - Yunnan province,35,

Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,"Nicotine-degrading microorganisms (NDMs) are a special microbial group which can use nicotine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth. Since the 1950s, the bioconversion of nicotine by microbes has received increasing attention, and several NDMs have been identified, such as Arthrobacter nicotinovorans, Microsporum gypseum, Pellicularia filamentosa JTS-208, and Pseudomonas sp. 41. In recent years, increasing numbers of NDMs have been isolated and identified from tobacco plantation soil, leaf, and tobacco waste. Meanwhile, the metabolic pathway and degradation mechanism of nicotine have been elucidated in several NDMs, such as A. nicotinovorans, Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33, Aspergillus oryzae, and Pseudomonas putida S16. Moreover, several NDMs have been used in improving the quality of cigarettes, treating tobacco waste, and producing valuable intermediates of nicotine.

Rare Met.,"Titanium slag in this study was produced by subjecting titanomagnetite concentrate to direct reduction-electric furnace smelting. Processing mineralogy and mineral phase reconstruction behavior at high temperature and slow cooling treatment were examined by chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Anosovite solid solution is the main titanium product by the direct reduction and smelting process. Results of slow-cooling experiments show that crystal volume and size increase as cooling rate decreases.

J Vib Shock,"Using SHPB test device, a test method used in layered medium dynamic performance study and data analysis was established. By adjusting bullet speeds and testing repeatedly, the varyings of stress and strain of hard-soft layered medium composed of C30 concrete and foam concrete versus time under impact loading were measured. The test results showed that the plastic property of the hard-soft layered medium is much stronger than that of hard material; the elastic modulus of the hard-soft layered medium decreases gradually with increase in stress and strain, the energy absorption action of soft material can effectively protect hard material, so the hard-soft layered medium has a good ability of anti-high speed shock and anti-shock wave propagation. ©, 2015, Chinese Vibration Engineering Society.

J. Chin. Inst. Food Sci. Technol.,"A method was developed for determination of portopanaxdiol(Rb1, Re and Rd) and protopanaxtriol (Rg1, Re and Rf) type finsenosides in medicinal and edible plants (Ginseng, American Ginseng and Notoginseng) by ultrasonic extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatography detection. The optimal extraction conditions were 50% methanol as the extraction solvent, material-to-liquid ratio 1:80 (g/mL) and extraction time 30 min. The analyses were performed on UPLC using acetontrile and 0.05% phosphoric acid solution gradient elution and with a detection wavelength of 203 nm. The experimental results showed a good linear relationship in the concentration range from 5 μg/mL to 1 000 μg/mL (R2>0.999). The method detection limits of six ginsenosides were 22.5-51.0 mg/kg, the recoveries for them were 98.1%-105.5%. The results showed that the method is rapid, convenient, accurate and applicable for the determination of ginsenosides in medicinal and edible plants. Based on this method, Ginseng, American Ginseng and Notoginseng samples were investigated. The data indicated that the content of portopanaxdiol type finsenosides were higher than protopanaxtriol. In three types of samples, the content of Rg1 was the highest in Notoginseng, Re was the richest in American ginseng samples, Rf was only detected in Ginseng. ©, 2015, Chinese Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J. Commun.,"Internet worms, a great threat to the Internet infrastructure, can propagate horrendously through networks, and reduce network security and cause economic losses. In order to effectively defend against worms, this paper proposes a novel epidemic SVEIR model with partial immunization. In the SVEIR model, we obtain the basic reproduction number for determining whether the worm dies out completely. The global stabilities of infection-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium are proven using a Lyapunov function and a geometrical approach. The impact of different parameters of this model is studied. Simulation results show that the number of susceptible and infected hosts is consistent with theoretical analysis. The model provides a theoretical foundation for control and forecasting Internet worms. © 2015 Journal of Communications.",,,20151700791854,,"Wang, Fangwei (1); Yang, Yong (2); Zhao, Dongmei (1); Zhang, Yunkai (3) ","(1) College of Information Technology, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang; 050024, China (2) Network and Information Center, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China (3) Department of Information Engineering, Shijiazhuang Institute of Railway Technology, Shijiazhuang; 050091, China ",,"461.7 Health Care - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 911.2 Industrial Economics - 921 Mathematics",,,,,Computer worms - Immunization - Losses - Lyapunov functions,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Yunkai(zhyk@hebtu.edu.cn) ",10.12720/jcm.10.4.276-283,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,17962021,4,2015,English,Network security,,24.0,276-283,,2015,Engineering and Technology Publishing,Journal of Communications,,A worm defending model with partial immunization and its stability analysis,,Basic reproduction number - Endemic equilibrium - Geometrical approaches - Infection free equilibrium - Internet infrastructure - Internet worm - Stability analysis - Theoretical foundations,10,
ICIC Express Lett Part B Appl.,"The New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) is a 1-meter vacuum solar telescope aiming to observe the fine structures on the Sun. It produces several terabytes of huge unreduced solar data in a day, and we reconstruct these data in near real-time using speckle masking algorithm on a cluster with Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, much time was devoted to reconstructing solar subimages in such a speckle reconstruction. We design and implement a new parallel method for speckle masking reconstruction of solar subimage on General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU). We transfer the main time-consuming program of subimage reconstruction into GPGPU with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) developed by NVIDIA. The real tests are performed to validate the correctness of our codes on NVIDIA Tesla C2050. We describe parallel implementation details for several steps of solar subimage reconstruction, and realize significant improvements in the runtime of several steps. The performance speedup comparison of the single thread CPU and CUDA-based implementation is illustrated with different sizes of raw data, and a significant speedup of around 4-6 is achieved to reconstruct one solar subimage of 256×256 pixels. The new parallel method would be valuable and ported to a high performance GPU cluster, and contribute to the real-time reconstruction of an entire solar image. ©, 2015 ICIC Express Letters Office.All Rights Reserved.",,,20153701273828,,"Li, Xuebao (1); Wang, Feng (1, 2); Xiang, Yongyuan (1); Jin, Zhenyu (1); Deng, Hui (2); Zheng, Yanfang (1) ","(1) Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O.Box110, Kunming, China (2) Computer Technology Application Key Lab of Yunnan Province, Kunming University of Science and Technology, No. 727, Jingming South Road, Chenggong District, Kunming, China ",,"657 Space Physics - 722.4 Digital Computers and Systems - 723.1 Computer Programming - 723.5 Computer Applications - 741 Light, Optics and Optical Devices - 741.1 Light/Optics",,,,,Computer graphics - Message passing - Parallel processing systems - Program processors - Speckle - Telescopes,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,21852766,10,"September 1, 2015",English,Image processing,,15.0,2845-2850,,2015,ICIC Express Letters Office,"ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications",,A new parallel method for speckle masking reconstruction for new vacuum solar telescope,,Compute Unified Device Architecture(CUDA) - CUDA - Design and implements - General purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) - GPGPU - Message passing interface - Parallel implementations - Real-time reconstruction,6,

IEEE Signal Process Lett,"How to estimate the number of passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and the occurrence probability of capture effect is very important for a dynamic frame length Aloha RFID system with capture effect. The estimation would relate to setting an optimal frame length, which makes tag identification achieve higher efficiency. Under large-scale tags identification environment, the number of tags may be much greater than an initial frame length. In this scenario, existing estimates do not work well. In this letter, we propose a novel estimation method for the large-scale tags identification. The proposed method could adjust the initial frame length matched to the number of tags from only the first several slots in the frame. The advantage of the proposed method is to work better even when the number of tags is much greater. Numerical results show that, the proposed method has lower estimation errors under the large-scale tag identification.

"World Environ. Water Resour. Congr.: Floods, Droughts, Ecosyst. - Proc. World Environ. Water Resour. Congr.",Southwestern China has experienced an imbalance growth between power supply and load demand for last decade. Meanwhile the construction of transmission lines is far behind the power supply growth. They together contribute to multistage congestion problem which threaten the reliability and stability of the power grid in wet season. This paper presents a method for coordinating the generation schedules of hydropower system of a municipal power grid. The objective is to maximize the total energy consumed on condition that ensuring the reliability and stability of the power grid. This is achieved by conceptualizing power grid as a diagraph based on the graph theory. Depth-First-Search (DFS) and transmission-line security checking are used to analyze topology relations of the power grid and flag overload transmission lines which violate the electric power transmission restrictions. A multistage congestion coordination strategy is introduced to iteratively coordinate the initial generation schedules of power supplies sharing overload transmission lines. The proposed method has been implemented to the hydropower system of Yunnan Power Grid in since 2014. The case results show that the method is feasible and practical. © 2015 ASCE.,,,20152701007202,,"Chen, Fu (1); Li, Gang (1); Cheng, Chuntian (1); Li, Xiufeng (2) ","(1) Institute of Hydropower and Hydroinformatics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China (2) Yunnan Power Dispatching Center, Yunnan Province, Kunming, China ",,"444 Water Resources - 454.3 Ecology and Ecosystems - 611.1 Hydroelectric Power Plants - 706 Electric Transmission and Distribution - 912.2 Management - 921.4 Combinatorial Mathematics, Includes Graph Theory, Set Theory - 921.6 Numerical Methods",112350.0,"May 17, 2015 - May 21, 2015","Austin, TX, United states","World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2015: Floods, Droughts, and Ecosystems",Drought - Ecosystems - Electric lines - Electric power system stability - Electric power systems - Electric power transmission - Electric power transmission networks - Floods - Graph theory - Hydroelectric power - Iterative methods - Scheduling - Traffic congestion - Water resources,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1061/9780784479162.189,Engineering Village,Compendex,Conference article (CA),,,,9780784479162.0,,,2015,English,Electric power system security,"World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2015: Floods, Droughts, and Ecosystems - Proceedings of the 2015 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress",22.0,1932-1943,1of1,2015,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),"World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2015: Floods, Droughts, and Ecosystems - Proceedings of the 2015 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress",Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),Scheduling the hydropower system of a municipal power grid considering multistage congestion problems,,Congestion problem - Coordination strategy - Depth-First-Search (DFS) - Generation schedules - Generation scheduling - Power grids - Reliability and stability - Security checking,,
Ind. Crops Prod.,"Fiber hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a sustainable and high yielding industrial crop that can help to meet the high global demand for fibers. Hemp can be grown for fiber, seeds, and/or for dual purpose in a wide range of geographic zones and climates. Currently the main hemp producing regions in the world are China, Europe, and Canada. The number of new cultivars developed for each of these regions has gradually increased, with each region producing its own typical hemp cultivars for different purposes. In this article, the state of the art of fiber hemp breeding programs in Europe, China, and Canada are reviewed. The breeding strategies and tools used in the breeding of hemp cultivars are discussed. We also provide an overview of genetic diversity in hemp for different traits. In addition, the current knowledge of the main breeding goals for fiber hemp, which are an improvement of fiber quality and fiber yield, breeding for specific cannabinoid profiles, control of flowering behavior, male flowering control, and breeding of cultivars for specific environments are evaluated. Lastly, we discuss the inestimable value of next generation technologies to breed new hemp cultivars that are suitable for a biobased economy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,,20152000841605,,"Salentijn, Elma M.J.

J. Agric. Food Chem.,"Nematophagous fungi are globally distributed soil fungi and well-known natural predators of soil-dwelling nematodes. Pochonia chlamydosporia can be found in diverse nematode-suppressive soils as a parasite of nematode eggs and is one of the most studied potential biological control agents of nematodes. However, little is known about the functions of small molecules in the process of infection of nematodes by this parasitic fungus or about small-molecule-mediated interactions between the pathogenic fungus and its host. Our recent study demonstrated that a P. chlamydosporia strain isolated from root knots of tobacco infected by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita produced a class of yellow pigment metabolite aurovertins, which induced the death of the free-living nematode Panagrellus redivevus. Here we report that nematicidal P. chlamydosporia strains obtained from the nematode worms tended to yield a total yellow pigment aurovertin production exceeding the inhibitory concentration shown in nematicidal bioassays. Aurovertin D was abundant in the pigment metabolites of P. chlamydosporia strains. Aurovertin D showed strong toxicity toward the root-knot nematode M. incognita and exerted profound and detrimental effects on the viability of Caenorhabditis elegans even at a subinhibitory concentration. Evaluation of the nematode mutation in the β subunit of F1-ATPase, together with the application of RNA interference in screening each subunit of F1FO-ATPase in the nematode worms, demonstrated that the β subunit of F1-ATPase might not be the specific target for aurovertins in nematodes. The resistance of C. elegans daf-2(e1370) and the hypersensitivity of C. elegans daf-16(mu86) to aurovertin D indicated that DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in nematodes was triggered in response to the aurovertin attack. These findings advance our understanding of the roles of aurovertin production in the interactions between nematodes and the pathogen fungus P. chlamydosporia. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,,20153101104479,,"Wang, Yan-Li (1); Li, Lin-Fang (1); Li, Dong-Xian (1); Wang, Baile (1); Zhang, Keqin (1); Niu, Xuemei (1) ","(1) Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Key Laboratory for Microbial Resources of the Ministry of Education, Yunnan University, Kunming; 650091, China ",JAFCAU,483.1 Soils and Soil Mechanics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 951 Materials Science,,,,,Metabolites - Molecules - Soils - Strain,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Keqin(kqzhang@ynu.edu.cn) ",10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02595,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),15205118,,,,00218561,29,"July 29, 2015",English,Fungi,,46.0,6577-6587,,2015,American Chemical Society,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,,Yellow Pigment Aurovertins Mediate Interactions between the Pathogenic Fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia and Its Nematode Host,,aurovertins - Caenorhabditis elegans - Nematophagous fungi - Pochonia chlamydosporia - Root knot nematode,63,
Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao,"Fast power flow transferring simulation analysis under various anticipated faults is an important guarantee for the safety and stability of power grid. To solve the difficulties in power flow transferring analysis during dispatching work, this paper proposed a rapid and accurate parallel batch method based on commercial power system analysis tool. On the basis of parameter analysis, automatically fault set and results parsing, power flow transferring analysis is carried out in batch, in which the topology of network is checked by depth first search (DFS) algorithm and the reasonableness of power flow calculation is also determined automatically. Furthermore, in a parallel framework based on Fork/Join, the batch method is performed in a multi-core parallel way by dividing task into smaller subtasks recursively using 'divide-and-conquer' algorithm. Simulation results of New England test system and actual application in Yunnan Power Grid indicate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. © 2015 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.",,,20154801631964,,"Luo, Bin (1); Li, Gang (1); Miao, Shumin (1); Cheng, Chuntian (1); Wu, Chen (2); Wang, Sen (3) ","(1) Institute of Hydropower & Hydroinformatics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian; Liaoning Province; 116024, China (2) Yunnan Electric Power Dispatching & Control Bureau, Kunming; Yunnan Province; 650011, China (3) Rearl River Water Resource Scientific Research Institute, Guangzhou; Guangdong Province; 510611, China ",ZDGXER,706.1 Electric Power Systems - 706.1.1 Electric Power Transmission,,,,,Electric power transmission networks,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,10.13334/j.0258-8013.pcsee.2015.21.008,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,02588013,21,"November 5, 2015",Chinese,Electric load flow,,29.0,5446-5454,,2015,Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering,Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao/Proceedings of the Chinese Society of Electrical Engineering,,A parallel batch method for power flow transferring analysis in large-scale power systems,,Depth-First-Search (DFS) - Fork/Join framework - Multi-core parallels - Power flow transferring - PSD-BPA,35,
J Alloys Compd,"Abstract The present study investigated the effect of co-doping with elemental crystal Ge or/and GeO2on the TiO2-Ta2O5-BaCO3varistor ceramic. Results showed that with the doping content of Ta2O5and BaCO3of 0.3 mol% and 0.2 mol%, respectively, the optimum doping content of 0.4 mol% Ge and 1.2 mol% GeO2exhibited the highest α value (α = 12.1), lower breakdown voltage EB(EB= 20.8 V mm-1), lesser leakage current JL(JL= 11.5 μA cm-2), and highest grain boundary barrier ΦB(ΦB= 0.93 eV). The microstructural analyses indicated that Ge-GeO2co-doping notably changed the TiO2-Ta2O5-BaCO3ceramic microstructure, increased α, and decreased EB. In addition, Ge and GeO2, which function as sintering aids, reduced the sintering temperature caused by the low melting point; the best sintering temperature was 1280°C for TiO2-Ta2O5-BaCO3-Ge-GeO2ceramic.",,,20153201159087,34228,"Kang, Kunyong (1); Yan, Jikang (1); Zhang, Jiamin (1); Du, Jinghong (1); Yi, Jianhong (1); Liu, Yichun (1); Bao, Rui (1); Tan, Songlin (1); Gan, Guoyou (1) ","(1) Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650093, PR China, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Yunnan Province, Kunming 650093, PR China, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Precious Nonferrous Metals, Ministry of Education, Kunming 650093, PR China, Kunming Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Precious Nonferrous Metals, PR China ",JALCEU,549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic Compounds - 812.1 Ceramics,,,,,Ceramic materials - Doping (additives) - Germanium - Germanium oxides - Grain boundaries - Sintering - Tantalum oxides - Titanium dioxide - Varistors,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Gan, Guoyou(ganguoyou@sina.com) ",10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.05.112,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 51262017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: 51362017, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ",The present work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Grant nos. 51262017 and 51362017 ).,,09258388,,"August 11, 2015",English,Barium compounds,,23.0,1280-1290,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,,"(Ge, GeO2, Ta2O5, BaCO3) co-doping TiO2varistor ceramics",,Ceramic microstructures - Co-doping - Grain-boundary barriers - Low melting point - Microstructural analysis - Nonlinear coefficient - Sintering temperatures - Varistor ceramics,649,
Fuel,"Abstract The use of various aluminum salts as acid catalysts was compared in terms of catalytic upgrading of renewable furfuryl alcohol in hot ethanol medium. The commercially available AlCl3was emerged as a simple, cheap, and efficient catalyst for the synthesis of ethyl levulinate. From this study, four significant parameters including AlCl3dosage, furfuryl alcohol concentration, temperature, and time were evaluated and modeled to determine the optimal combination via response surface methodology with a central composite rotatable design. All parameters influenced the formation of ethyl levulinate - the maximum yield was 95.7% (100% furfuryl alcohol conversion). AlCl3could be recovered efficiently and reused multiple times without substantial loss of its catalytic activity. Moreover, AlCl3as the catalyst with optimized conditions was appropriate for the alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol in other linear alcohols to afford equally high yields of the corresponding alkyl levulinates. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,,20153301169609,9491,"Peng, Lincai (1); Gao, Xueying (1); Chen, Keli (1) ","(1) Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming; Yunnan; 650500, China ",FUELAC,804 Chemical Products Generally - 921.5 Optimization Techniques,,,,,Aluminum chloride - Catalyst activity - Optimization,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Peng, Lincai(penglincai8@163.com) ",10.1016/j.fuel.2015.07.086,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,"Number: 2013FD007, Acronym: -, Sponsor: Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; Number: 201410674004, Acronym: -, Sponsor: -; Number: 21406099, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21406099 ), the Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province of China ( 2013FD007 ), and the National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of China ( 201410674004 ).",,00162361,,"August 12, 2015",English,Chlorine compounds,,42.0,123-131,,2015,Elsevier Ltd,Fuel,,"Catalytic upgrading of renewable furfuryl alcohol to alkyl levulinates using AlCl3as a facile, efficient, and reusable catalyst",,AlCl3 - Alkyl levulinates - Catalytic upgrading - Central composite rotatable design - Furfuryl alcohol - Optimal combination - Optimized conditions - Response surface methodology,160,
Wuli Xuebao,"In this paper, we collect the 37 years' data observed for BL Lac object OJ287 in the optical band, and construct its light curve from 1972 to 2009. Using the method of Lomb-Scargle Fourier transform, we analyze the middle time-scale periodic behavior and discover the primary periodic compositions of 52.0±1.1 day and 255±23 day. Then, we simulate the quasi-periodic signal of period doubling bifurcations and compare it with the observation data at different time-interval in their phase diagram and correlation dimension. Result indicates that OJ287 has multi-period scale features. At different time-intervals, there are different harmonic period components in the quasi-periodic light curve. Variation of harmonic period component is related with the disturbance of accretion flow which is from the secondary black hole to the primary black hole, and the periodicity variability may bifurcate the harmonic period component when the primary accretion flow is influenced by a strong disturbance. © 2015 Chinese Physical Society.",,,20153001062064,139801,"Ding, Nan (1); Zhang, Hao-Jing (1); Zhang, Xiong (1); Ou, Jian-Wen (1); Luo, Dan (1) ","(1) School of Physics and Electronic Information Technology, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming; 650500, China ",WLHPAR,"657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 921.6 Numerical Methods - 931.5 Gravitation, Relativity and String Theory",,,,,Bifurcation (mathematics) - Gravitation - Stars,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Zhang, Hao-Jing(kmzhanghj@163.com) ",10.7498/aps.64.139801,Engineering Village,Compendex,Journal article (JA),,,,,10003290,13,"July 5, 2015",Chinese,Harmonic analysis,,38.0,,,2015,"Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica,,A study of the middle time-scale periodic behavior of light curve of BL Lac object OJ287,,Accretion flow - Correlation dimensions - Observation data - OJ287 - Period doubling bifurcation - Period of light variation - Periodic behavior - Quasi-periodic signals,64,
Zhongguo Jiguang,"A new type of Ag nanofilm with high efficiency is prepared and used here, acting as a near-infrared surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (NIR-SERS) substrate to detect oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) for 22 cervical cancer patients and 22 healthy females. NIR-SERS results show that there is striking spectral difference of the OxyHb between healthy females and cervical cancer patients. Meanwhile, principal component analysis (PCA) combined with independent sample T-test analysis is employed to analyze the measured NIR-SERS spectra, and it is found that the measured NIR-SERS spectra of the two groups are separated into two distinct clusters in terms of the sensitivity of 86.4% and the specificity of 86.4%. Tentative assignments of the Raman bands of the measured NIR-SERS spectra are also performed, and the results suggest that cancer specific changes at molecular level, including pyrrole ring and vibration mode of the OxyHb molecules are significant. The NIR-SERS detection of OxyHb for cervical cancer patients based on PCA combined with independent sample T-test is expected to develop into a new diagnostic tool for cervical cancer. ©, 2014, Science Press.

Comput. Hum. Behav.,"Creativity in the use of information systems (IS) is critical to the performance and long-term success of organizations. Building on an organizational ambidexterity perspective, we investigate ambidexterity in IS usage which is defined as the capacity to simultaneously achieve exploitative usage and explorative usage at a workgroup level. This paper seeks to test the relationships among creative process, usage ambidexterity, and group performance. Based on a sample of 55 workgroups, we found that exploitative usage negatively influences usage ambidexterity while explorative usage positively influences it, and that usage ambidexterity positively influences group performance. Moreover, the findings indicate that usage ambidexterity mediates the effect of exploitative and explorative usage on group performance. Overall, the study contributes to greater clarity and a better understanding of how the creative process influences group performance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
